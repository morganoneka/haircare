27,"Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Frizz Control Sculpting Gel & Defining Cream (2-Pack) - 6 fl oz - Flexible Hold for Curly Hair - Moisturize, Condition, Protect, and Enhance Curls",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used just the gel, as by this time I know creams are a no-go ...","I bought this in the first, frenzied days of grabbing different products to try. Maybe this would work for gals that have a strong 3a/3c pattern and don't need hold or don't mind messing around diffusing every other day. But I didn't find the hold to be spectacular. I had to really ""work"" the diffuser to get my Botticelli curls, which are deep waves that spiral, to present. I need max hold and nothing super heavy. The scent was unremarkable. Can't recommend."
