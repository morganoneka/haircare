0,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product is amazing... BUT BUY THE 12OZ not 18OZ,"before I tell you how good the product is-- BUY THE 12OZ!! Not the 18oz. It is cheaper per ounce.the 12 oz is usually $15.the 18 oz is usually $30... paying twice as much for only 1.5 times the product!I've found local places and Target are reliable for the good price on the 12 oz.Okay... this was my first new hair gel try in years that I have loved.I have 3a hair and have used the ""Curls"" blueberry and passionfruit gels and other products for probably 6 years. I wanted to try out some new products after seeing so many more on Tiktok that weren't available in my local stores curls section.This is INCREDIBLE!! My curls have never looked shinier and better. It holds well but softly, smells so good, and lasts forever. I bought this 18 oz for $30 in March or April 2020 and it lasted until January 2021. Almost a whole year. I have had very short hair for most of this year, but I am a notorious over-producter (the curls need moisture!!) and I use a pump or two everyday. I am obsessed."
1,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!,Love this product! My stylist recommended I use it and now I'm hooked on all of their products.I was using DevaCurl before this and there was a lot of build up and residue on my scalp from the creme leave in.I use uncle funky's after the shower now and my hair feels light and soft. My curls don't get fuzzy and I can make them last for multiple days. I wear my hair short and have tight curls. I've given it to friends with long hair and they love it too. It's also really great to smooth down edges and get a clean pony-tail. Could not recommend more :)!
2,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft Long-Lasting Curls,"The product does work, but I have an afro so it's a little limited. If you have hair like mine, don't expect bangin' poppin' bouncy curls. It more brings out your natural curl pattern and your hair will be soft. I've found it work best if you put your sopping-wet-freshly-washed hair in sections and do at least a pump per section (smaller sections, not quarters, go root to tip) and diffuse (blow dry) your hair until it's not wet and sticky (it can air dry the rest of the way) so that the product sets the curls nicely and the curl pattern holds strong for up to a week. Overall, I'm happy with the product and I will order again."
3,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wash n go,Great for wash and go. Needs hair to be dripping wet. Check YouTube for vids on application.
4,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ingredients added protein and glycerin,"I started using this product about a year ago because it was one of the few protein, glycerin and coconut free products I could find for my kids’ low porosity hair hair. I was so pleased with the softness and hold with fantastic ingredients, no bad preservatives. Then their hair started to feel dry a few weeks back with nothing changed in our hair routine. I finally took a look at the ingredient list and saw that they added wheat protein and glycerin and took out chamomile extract. Basically added the stuff I was so pleased it did not have. It finally made sense why I was struggling suddenly. Protein hardens my kids hair and now it’s one of the top ingredients. *sigh* why can’t these companies stick to the original formula? It’s already so hard to find protein free products out there. I will not be purchasing again."
5,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Wavies too!,I have wavy 2c/3a hair and after 25 years of straightening my hair have decided to embrace my natural waves and curls. This is awesome. I only have to use 2-3 pumps for my entire hair and I follow with a light gel for some extra hold. This does not leave my hair hard or crunchy and helps me get more defined curls. Definitely a go to for me.
6,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent for fine hair, chemically curly hair, or wavies!",I have very fine hair that is permed. I struggle to find products that enhance my curls without weighing them down since I'm not a natural curly. This stuff is excellent! It leaves a great cast and my curls look so defined and bouncy after I scrunch out the crunch! I just use it over my Blueberry Bliss Leave In and I'm good to go!
7,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go to for my wash & goes,I have tried many products when it comes to wash & goes and I can honestly say that Uncle Funky's Curly Magic Curl Stimulator is exactly what my hair needs. I live in AZ where the weather is hot and dry. This products adds tons of moisture  to my hair and my wash & goes last longer. I have seen a definite change in my hair health. I love it!
8,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No flakes, no flakes, hurray","Love, love, love Curly Magic! No flakes on my wash and go, plus it really gave me an all week hold! Curls were still in place at the end of the week and not hard and crunchy. Do you know what that means for someone who is truly busy! Can't wait to try this on a twist out."
9,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curling Gel Dream,"First off, this product is a GEL and not a curl cream or anything of that variety. I thought it was a curl cream but when I realized it was a gel I still gave it a try, and wow!! I have about 2A -B hair most days and this easily transformed my natural waves into CURLS. The pictures are from the previous day using my normal products and the next day only changing out my normal gel for Uncle Funky's. What a difference it made! The gel cast was good, not crazy firm but still good. The smell is fairly strong when applying, but I can't smell it on my hair at all now. You do get a big bottle so I feel like the price is worth it for how well it works. I'm very pleased with this product and would gladly purchase more!"
10,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product but received an open bottle.,"I want to start by saying I love this product.Originally I bought the trial size from target and thought I hated it because I applied it to damp hair and it didn’t have that slippery feeling.Then I went to a coily hair stylist (earnestlynatural in Raleigh, NC) and she taught me 1) reading is fundamental and 2) always apply in the shower, to soaking wet hair.. like the bottle says.So after she performed actual magic on my head (see last photo) I decided to get the product for myself so I can start doing my own wash and goes. I ordered a full sized bottle but when it arrived, as you can see, the product was spilling out of the container. This gel isn’t cheap (rightly so), so any product loss feels like a waste of money. I am currently working on getting a refund and reordering so hopefully I have better luck with the next shipment.Also last thing, I highly recommend looking up Iamblackgirlcurl, throw out the lco and loc methods, and change your life."
11,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,New different formula,"The new formula has jojoba oil as the fourth ingredient, the old one has none of this ingredient. They also added glycerin as the second ingredient. It was also not present in the old formula. Why did they tamper with it? It was legendary."
12,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the BOMB!!,"1st, Hair Type: I have 2C-3A hair that falls about mid-back. 2C-3A hair means tighter waves with loose ringlets mixed in.2nd, The Search: I have searched, and researched and purchased product after product looking for that golden ring of hair products. (Its a reference. Look it up) Products that don't have phosphates, parabens, silicones etc, don't leave me with ramen noodle hair, or look greasy, or feel sticky, or smell like Mrs. Marcus's dollar store Floral Delight perfume that she pours all over herself before she sits down in the church pew right in front of me. Every time. I swear, that woman must have brain damage from the fumes by now.3rd, Discovery!: Uncle Funky's Daughter Products! The Curly Magic is just that, MAGIC BABY!! It has none of the bad ingredients and smells great.  It is a gel, but acts more like a custard. It provides great wavy curl hold without frizz. It does not feel sticky or gunky. No greasy, I used way too much product, look either.Uncle Funky's Curly Magic is exactly the curly gel I was looking for.All hair is different of coarse, but I cannot recommend this enough.Another Uncle Funky's Daughter product you should try is the Heal and Renew mask. Excellent!!"
13,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Full bouncy curls,This is amazing to help bounce and spiral curls for my type 3A type curls (works best on my wet hair) and then defuse for crunchless curls. Love this and the thirsty curls for next day curls.
14,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Product Ever!!,"I began using this product went I first went natural 8 years ago. It was my staple product, I them backtracked and now I'm beginning a new hair journey with this amazing product again. It truly moisturized my hair from root to tip and keeps a gorgeous shine. I also use it on my 6 year old daughter's hair. 100% natural ingredients and it shows."
15,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously, Saw This On TikTok","I saw this on TikTok and loved the results so I gave it a try.  I have 2C-3A, color treated and highlighted hair and it can be a challenge to set and hold a curl sometimes.  I used this in conjunction with a generic firm hold gel, raked it through wet hair, plopped for a half hour and then dried with an infrared diffuser.  FRIZZ IS NON-EXISTENT!!!!  I was amazed! I got decent volume with no frizz and I can get several days out of a single style by using a satin night cap and lightly spritzing with water, scrunching in more curly magic in the morning, and diffusing again.  This product just took a huge chunk out of my morning routine and has left my hair looking extremely healthy while defining and holding my curls.  Try it - it's worth the dollars!"
16,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Defined Curls!,My stylist recommended this product. I can use it after rinsing out conditioner without applying a Leave-in in first. It is great for fine hair like mine.  Love the definition!!
17,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,White Dust Galore,"If you want to shower everyone with white dust every time you turn your head too fast, this is the product for you. Smells good, looks ok- but the white cloud of dust hovering around me is just too much drama. Forget wearing black or dark colors unless you like the dusty look there too."
18,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pure Magic!,"I wasn’t certain what to expect from using Curly Magic as I have fine, thin, wavy-when-it-feels-like-it hair.  My hair has gotten thinner and more damaged looking over the last year, likely due to pandemic-fueled stress and normal aging.  Anyway, I bought this a week or so ago, and cannot believe how much my hair has changed!  I have my waves back, and my hair is glossy and healthy looking.  I also started using Uncle Funky’s Daughter Shampoo at the same time, but I know that this was the “key” to my lost waves.Application suggestion:  My first try with this didn’t give great results, but that is because there is a bit of a learning curve with any product and I wasn’t using enough.  I went from using 1 pump to 3 and that made all of the difference!  I don’t use any conditioner, as this and the shampoo together are conditioning enough.  Thank you so much for an amazing product!"
19,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Painfully Worth Every Penny,"After communicating an error in the size of the product that I received vs. the size I had ordered, the seller has graciously and generously corrected the issue.  So, now I can say, this product works wonders for those of us with VERY curly, VERY thick, VERY full, VERY coarse; and LOTS of hair!! It takes only a small amount in comparison to similar products, you'll have to adjust for your particular type of hair.  It moisturizes and has a nice, soft hold and can be refreshed for a couple of days with a spritz of water. So, while the upfront investment may seem a bit steep, you should be able to justify the cost with performance and staying power."
20,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good stuff,"I have 2b - 3a hair, straightish underlayer, just past shoulder length hair. Medium porosity and fairly protein sensitive. I try not to use too many products with Shea butter and hydrolyzed proteins, or at least not all at once, to make sure the moisture/protein ratio stays balanced so my hair doesn't feel like straw.My current routine is to squeeze out extra water in the shower but don't use a towel to dry. I emulsify and rake through Shea moisture curl enhancing cream, then use a small amount of mop top jelly on areas that need a bit of extra sealing (I get bad crown frizz), then a couple quarter sized amounts of curly magic from ends up, squishing and scrunching, then diffuse.Because my hair is only wavy in sections I prefer to use a strong hold gel that leaves a cast so the curl pattern holds up when I scrunch out the crunch later in the morning. I can also wait to scrunch later in the day if I want to preserve the hold for a night out because this dries without the ""weird Al"" effect. My hair is absolutely beautiful either way, no flaking!! It is similar to kinky curly custard in this way, but for me the results are softer overall.The very few cons: I find is that the cast doesn't come back if I refresh with a bit of water... Maybe this is due to less nettle? Not sure, but this definitely isn't enough to detract from it's overall performance in my opinion. Also, if I scrunch out too much crunch I can tend to get frizzy pretty quickly so maybe I just need to add a drop of jojoba oil to the routine. Lastly, because this so easy to scrunch I tend to get residue on my hands that becomes sticky in any kind of moisture, and I really really hate having sticky hands.One of my favorite things about this product is how versatile it is. I can layer it on top of pretty much anything and it helps generally with extra hold and frizz containment. That being said, those who need additional frizz prevention might benefit from something additionally emollient to seal the cuticle, especially if diffusing."
21,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,love/hate relationship,"I really want to love this product. I use it with Supercurl and it definitely elevates the type of curl (i’m usually 2b/c), making them big and bouncy. It’s very different from my normal look (people actually comment asking what I’ve used/done), but they stay light and relatively nice to touch (I do not like feeling product in my hair. I can feel this, but it’s tolerable).However, this is single day product to me. I’ll wash my hair in the morning, use both products, and need to wash it when I get home. If I don’t wash it, the next day it feels a bit gross (almost slimy and clumpy) and gets very tangled, which is not a normal issue for me. Despite this, I would recommend because I know I can use it in a pinch."
22,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hair gel I’ve ever used!!!,"This gel is AMAZING!!! It’s cruelty free and full of good stuff like ALOE(2 Nd ingredient!), marshmallow, nettle and vitamin E. It’s SUPER light but sooo moisturizing and rich at the same time. It’s the first thing I’ve tried that allows me to do a wash & go! Once it dries just a rub through my hair removes the light cast, and my hair super soft. A must have if your hair is fine (I’m mixed with 3c curls). I just did the “big chop” and couldn’t find ANYTHING that worked for me until this— I LOVE IT!!!"
23,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells nice and does its job well!,"First of all, I love the natural ginger-y scent of this product. It's very fresh and not artificial. Indo need to be careful with this product as my fine, wavy hair will get over moisturized if I use this with a leave- in or use too much. After playing around with amount and other products to use it with (and even by itself) I have found that it provides a light cast (crunch) in my hair that can easily be scrunched out, it refreshes nicely on day 2 and 3. And it does stimulate more curls. I really enjoy this product."
24,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wasted money on another bad product,"It didn’t work on my coarse, 3a curls at all! It had promise. When wet, it immediately felt stiff and clumped my curls. As soon as I started to diffuse, frizz started to separate out of the curls. Now that it’s almost dry, there essentially are no curls. It’s just a big, soft, fluffy mess. I have very low porosity, very dry hair. There is normally no such thing as too much moisture for me, so I don’t think that’s it. I have no clue what this product did to me, but I absolutely hate it. It is WAY over priced and simply NOT worth it."
25,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Magic!,"I don't know how long I have waiting for the holy grail of hair care products for my tresses, but I have finally found it! This stuff truly is magic in a bottle. I love the smell, the slip, definition and the hold. Since following the ""Wash Your Damn Hair"" hair care routine : Shampoo, condition and Curly Magic are all I need as a natural and my hair, sanity, and time, is better for it."
26,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Curly Magic!!,"This gel makes my 4c coils pop, pop, POP!!Absolutely love this product and it does not dry out my hair, unlike some other gels.  On the contrary, it keeps it moisturized.  It has really been a wonderful addition to my healthy hair routine."
27,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Review would’ve been better if it arrived in better condition.,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The rating would’ve been higher for the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curly Magic Curl Stimulator if it wasn’t for the condition of the product upon arrival. I read some of the reviews here that take time to mention that the product container arrived leaking or the pump was broken upon arrival, so I contacted Amazon, trying to stress that they take care to pack it so that it doesn’t arrive broken. I mean, it is an expensive product, so take care that it arrived well so we can get our money’s worth.  Well, it arrived, and not only was it leaking through the bag that they wrapped around the bottle, getting the other contents in the box covered (one item was to be a birthday present!!) but, when I tried to engage the pump, it was broken, hence why it was leaking how it was. I am absolutely disappointed. Why can’t they pack it where the pump is to the side and the bottle is topped with a screw top??Since I can’t really comment on the full use of the product, since the pump isn’t working, and i couldn’t fully follow directions on the bottle, I will say, based on trying to use the product without pump that it is good.  Maybe I used too much, maybe I used too little, but, not my fault if the item arrived broken, right?!?  It moisturized my hair, pronounced my curl a bit, is lightweight for my 4 hair. Good for summer.Will I buy it again?  If it’s available nearby where I can purchase it in store, or if it’s packaged differently where nothing gets damaged during shopping (as in screw top with pump mechanism to the side, that you can assemble yourself), certainly. But otherwise…And now, if you don’t mind, I have to find a replacement pump to try to use this product properly."
28,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle at last!,"Only product I use now!  I have tight curls that always frizzed. Frizz doesn't exist anymore! And I have cut 15 minutes out of my morning routine! Now I just wash, squeeze out excess water, and apply liberal amount and finger comb it through.  Air dry usually, but diffuse drying works too! This is the miracle product I've been looking for, for 26 years!"
29,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,no no no,This product has nettle leaf in it.  If you have sensitive skin I would NOT buy this.  I had the worst allergic reaction on my scalp that migrated to my back anywhere my wet hair with product touched.  I looked insane with a rash and blisters.
30,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Need curl definition? Here it is!,"My curls are 3B-3C, and this product has been great for providing curl definition without the crunch of gel. It is almost, almost my Holy Grail product- great slip, no residue, and holds up in humidity. It's a bit heavy, so apply it little by little. It is definitely worth a try for curlistas. I use it with Shea Moisture products and got great results. Because inquiring minds want to know: I am Caucasian with tight, tight coils of Middle Eastern origin. This product has made a real difference in defining my curls. Also the product name is cool! It's pretty darn close to magic..."
31,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,1000 Stars!,"Real talk, I have had the serrious blues because I have quarantine hair.  I've been natural for 20 years and I've worn my hair low for 20 years and I have no clue how to style or do my hair.  Whatever hair styling skills I had 20 years ago are long gone.  My hair is the longest it's been in 20 years (about 2 inches).  I got my Uncle Funky's Daughter products today, I used them immediately, and I'm a dedicated, loyal customer for life already.  I'm telling you, right now I want to order more stuff from Amazon just so my UPS driver can see my hair.  I'm even contemplating letting my hair grow after quarantine because I'm so in love with these products.  Nahhh, let's not get crazy.  Oh, and I didn't use a ton of product like I've been using with other lady's daughter's products where my hair sucked up the product and left my hair looking crazy an hour later."
32,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY: dries out hair and pump doesn’t work,"The product came BROKEN and LEAKING. The product spilled all over the cardboard box that it was delivered in. It was so bad that I couldn’t even return it because I didn’t know how to package it. The pump didn’t have a proper spring so I could not pump the product out,I had to unscrew the top which made application even more inconvenient and messy.I let all of this slide hoping that the product itself would be worth the money. Unfortunately, the product itself sucks. It really dried out my hair and it did not keep any curl pattern. Instead it made my hair grow frizzy and expand horizontally making my long curly hair look like a brushed out fro rather than a well moisturized mane. Curly girls BEWARE!I am never buying hair products or any liquid from amazon again, this isn’t the first time I had issues with hair product deliveries from amazon."
33,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is pretty good!,I have mostly 4C texture it does more for adding texture to make coils in my hair than everything else. My co workers have all asked what I used on my hair this time. It does however take a bit more time to dry than with all the other gels and creams I've tried. But the coil pattern has lasted 6 days in some areas (not effected so much by rough sleep) but I will continue to use it and I will try other products from the colection.
34,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome gel with no oils/butters!,Love this gel for my type 4 natural hair! I started doing the 30 detox for no oils/butters and I'm amazed at how moisturized my hair feels days after using this product! I get great definition and reduced frizz! It takes awhile to air dry but worth it!
35,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE this product!  All curly hair ladies, this is a MUSY HAVE in the hair arsenal","Love this product!  My sister gave me my first bottle  February 2021 and it lasted me almost 5 months.I use it at the end of my hair routine.After cowashing, I place leave in conditioner in my hair and comb that through.Then I will dry my hair slightly with the towel.Last I will pump one or two pumps of Curly Magic into my hand and distribute this equally throughout my hair with my hands and fingers.When my hair naturally dries it has curls that hold, have definition; are not frizzy, and my hair is still soft and touchable.Now I am a huge fan!"
36,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff,"FYI: for best results, scrunch this into WET hair...like seriously, still dripping. I let mine air dry from there and it gets super stiff, but once it's dry you can scrunch again with just your dry hands and break the cast. To avoid frizz, try not to mess with it until it's dry and you're ready to break the cast. As it began to dry I had my doubts, but it's surprising how defined and soft my waves were once it was all done. I will repurchase."
37,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Great,I have very tight curls and this product for my kind of hair makes it feel icky and dry. I used it a handful of times to see if it was just the way I was using it or maybe just that day but it was like this all the times. I don’t recommend it for tight curled haired people. It also felt a bit heavy on my hair with a quarter sized pump on my hand.
38,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally,"Finally found a product that works for me after almost trying every natural hair product there is.  I initially ordered the trial/travel pack.  I usually style my natural hair in twist out or braid out.  It lasted 5 days. Refreshed using leave-in conditioner every other day or so.  So far I am loving this stuff.  I would surely recommend Uncle Funky's daughter products. My hair is white/gray and does not have an effect on the color. No flakes, and keeps hair moisturized and soft. Looking forward to testing other product in this line.  Please do not change the formula.I will try to add pictures on an update."
39,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Curled but crunchy,"I could never get a wash and go before I used this product.  I wash and used Knott Today conditioner and add this curly magic and my hair immediately turns curlier.  It can be shingled, twist, or pull through with a comb--hair automatically curls.  HOWEVER, hair is  crunchy and hard when dries. So I will need to find a way to work around the crunchiness."
40,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Yuck!,"I tried this product because I heard so many people rave about it. Was very excited. Now so disappointed. This gel glopped in strings in my hair and deposited white dried pieces of gel throughout my hair. It looked like I had a peeling scalp  or out of control large flakes of dandruff (neither of these problems do I have). When I scrunched out the crunch, flakes fell out of my hair like I had just put flour in my hair. I was so embarrassed. Not even the cheapest store brand gel has ever done this to my hair. I will not ever buy any of these products again."
41,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t like this product,I dislike this product because of how it makes my hair look and feel.It makes it looks like it dry dirty and when you comb it out it looks like you have a lot of dandruff
42,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken pump,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   How do you get the pump to work ?  The pump will not work no matter which way i twist or turn.  Can the company send a new one ?"
43,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Defective mechanism,Usually I don't have time for reviews but I am not happy with this company. I bought this product for my curly hair and was looking forward to using it. When I received it the pump mechanism did not work so I had to return it. They charged me a return fee which I specifically asked not to happen as the product was DEFECTIVE. I think the company should uphold the quality of their product and never charge for something that is defective. Disappointed and will not order again.
44,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enhances Curls,I really love this product. My stylist introduced me to it and now I cannot go without. My curls are defined and beautiful. My curls last for days.
45,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,SUPER STICKY,"It was harsh to pay so much money for this product. $33.  It has marshmallow in it and is super sticky.  It holds some curl, but if you get sweaty at all your curls will stick to your neck from the marshmallow in the product.  It is really really gross!!"
46,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of curls,"Already use the moisture, added this to my arsenal to fight wayward sorta curly sorta not hair. Doesn’t take a whole lot to crunch through and let me tell you, it grabs those unruly strands and commands their attention! I find, (during winter) I do let it dry naturally but it takes a very long time, so I hit it with the blow dryer to finish it off, works like a charm! Body, curls, shiny. What else, right?"
47,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing for my 2c waves/curls,"This stuff is amazing on my hair. I use it after leave-in conditioner and it slightly “seizes” the curls where they need to be. Then I plop, diffuse/air dry, and then gently scrunch. Holds my soft waves, not heavy at all on my fine hair. I can use some gel if I want a stronger hold but it’s typically all I need for working from home these days."
48,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Came damaged with product all over,"I love this product and usually purchase it at my hair salon but I decided to just go with Amazon! The box was handed to me so I know it was not the fault of the delivery guy! I opened and the product was everywhere in the box. I took the bottle out and the pump wasn’t working! Thank God, I didn’t throw away my old one, I had to switch the pumps and throw away the new one! Very disappointing for an expensive product"
49,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great finisher for curly hair,My favorite wet gel! Gets my curls perfect every time!
50,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Curly Magic,"Tried Curly Magic for the first time in combination with a different brand of Almond & Avocado Curl Defining Creme Gel. I works great in my hair and the curls were poppin'.  The Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic reminds of the way DEVA curl smells, which is not my favorite, but will do because it works well.I would consider buying this product again if I don't find a better curl product."
51,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT FOR MY FINE NATURAL HAIR,"This product is amazing and I hope they never stop making it or change the formula. It defines my fine textured natural hair without making it hard or weighing it down. I should add, I have a TWA. It leaves my hair shiny, define and adds a little volume.  I don't know my hair type, but if I were to guess I would say its 4a and 4b. I would recommend this product."
52,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect amount of hold,"I’ve tried several different gels but keep coming back to this one as it seems to have just the right amount of hold for my hair type. I have medium/coarse hair, low density, low porosity, and a mixture of type 2a and 2b waves. This is my go-to gel when I need to reset my hair and don’t feel like experimenting with other hair products."
53,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Softens and defines curls,"I like the look that this product makes my hair curl, but it is very sticky possibly due to the aloe vera as part of its ingredients.  It’s not cheap, and I wonder if making my own formula with aloe would have the same effect.  It was worth a try, but too exp since I wash my hair two to three times a week."
54,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Defines curls and hold them for days on end.,"This is my favorite product for a wash and go. The secret is to apply a lot to soaking wet hair. I apply mine in the shower after coating with a leave in cream, and then I top it with a good hold gel. This (along with my wash routine) helped to normalize my previously high porosity hair. Highly recommend."
55,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am too lazy to do reviews, this product deserves it... AMAZING on black natural hair","specially for wash and gos! love it love it.Tips: use your leave in and keep your hair as wet as possible, take very small pieces of hair and take the gel with your fingers! Diffuse afterwards of possible."
56,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Defined curls and shine,I love the product it works well with everything I use or can be used by itself have great curl definition and shine for days  the only negative thing is the price is high but I would repurchase
57,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Straight or curly, best gel for texture and hold.","Ok, this stuff is so nice! My hair does great with this whether I blow dry straight or defuse for curls.  Lightweight, soft, smells fresh.  Highly recommend this gel regardless, especially if you don't want a heavy hold. By that I mean, it holds amazing but your hair feels soft and touchable.  Best hair gel on the market, hands down!"
58,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little slick and sticky, but with the right amount it’s great!","Love me some uncle funky! No frizz with this stuff, just curls! I would recommend to all my sisters with super dry hair and frizzy from birth. Put in your favorite conditioner and pump a little in your hand and go theough your hair. Then comb it through with a big comb it keeps the curl pattern going all day"
59,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,No,I followed the instructions but its not as they advertised on Instagram. I have a curly hair. Sinc I'm using this product all my curls are gone and my hair looks frizzy
60,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it.,Gurl! My 4c high porosity hair LOVES this stuff. Lifetime customer now for sureee
61,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does not leave hair dry!,"I've used several different gels that have all left my hair dry and brittle.  This gel works wonders!  I have been natural for 8 years.  I did not use gel consistently for the longest because I didn't like how it made my hair feel after applying it. Went to a hairstylist, she used this on my hair and I was amazed at how well it moisturized, yet provided hold but didn't make my hair feel ""crunchy"" or look dry.  I have ran out of this and tried using other gels hoping that maybe applying the others a different way would provide a different result to no avail.  This gel is absolutely amazing! I've been using it for the past 2 or 3 years, a game changer!"
62,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"What I like about the curly magic is that you don't have to use a lot to get the curls you need, it smells good and has like a slimy texture but it works very well on making the natural hair very curly and using with the rest of the Uncle Funky's Daughters line will make your hair nice soft and bouncy."
63,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wave magic!,This stuff really is magical! Creates beautiful clumps for my 2b-2c waves. It smells nice and the ingredients are so natural. Will definitely be purchasing again.
64,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light and easy,This product works great on my coily curly hair. It looks like snot - but it’s important to put the product on the hair when it is wet from the wash. I personally let it dry naturally and the curls seem to stay elongated. The curl refresher works well to freshen up the curls daily. But it is all very light on the hair.
65,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff.,"I love this stuff it’s great with all of the Uncle Funky’s products, and has great slip."
66,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best hair cream,"The texture was heavy, leaves my hair very coarse. Won’t buy again."
67,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,D,I bought this product for my daughter bc she was looking for a natural curly look to her hair. It Adds a nice looking curl BUT… it leaves a white clumpy film on the hair. I wouldn’t buy this product again. It was not worth the money
68,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like magic!,"I have curly, fine hair... Must be applied to soaking wet hair. Dries soft and shiny. I have tried the curly girl method for the last 7 years, without much luck. I found out about Uncle Funky's from a YouTube video.  I thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did. You you want to get rid of frizz, this is a must try"
69,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Staple Hair Gel,"I have been using Uncle Funky's Daughter consistently since it was recommended to me by my stylist.  I love it!  It has great moisturizing qualities and I receive so many compliments on my wash and go hairstyles.  There is a slight learning curve with the product.  A little goes a long way.  Once you learn what works for your hair, I believe you will agree, it is a great product!"
70,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"very moisturising..soft , smells good to me but it does not give much hold... every hair condition will love it whether you have hydrated or dehydrated hair. should be added with another product to give hold if your hair is dehydrated .. if your hair is hydrated.. you will give this 10/10... love that is a botanical gel"
71,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not Great!,I like the initial shone but after it dries it does flake. There is major cast. But if you wet it looks ok. I also have a problem with keeping it in the fridge because if I forget to put it back...im worried all day if it is going to spoil. But it ok. I like the natural ingredients.
72,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Products good /packaging bad,The entire pump missing.. but waited and needed so i transferred to another pump‼BUT NATURAL HAIR WILL LOVE‼ THIS PRODUCT...the extra butter is good too‼$$ fot amount 8oz...and not only half full.‼ These products make going natural (hair) easy  👍🏾
73,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,"On all the Curley girl sites women rave about this so I had to try it . I have tried just about every product and this by far is the best.  I love the way my hair came out , way more manageable. Would highly recommend!!!"
74,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product.  Amazon price a little higher than in stores.,"Great for my natural hair.  Makes my hair easy to comb, no greasiness and stays moisturized for at least a week!  A bit sticky before it drys. Cheaper in stores if you can find it.  Shelves are usually empty.  Easier to order from Amazon."
75,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly hair!,I’ve been using this product for a while and I absolutely love it! It’s definitely strengthened the curl in my hair and doesn’t leave your hair stiff. Maximum results with minimum effort.
76,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love This Stuff!,"I’ve been on this natural hair care journey for a long time, so I’ve tried multiple products.

79,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my med-high porosity frizz-prone curly hair,I have a lot of curly hair stylers that were either too heavy for my hair or made my hair frizzy and sticky.  This one is perfect and it works really well to fight frizz even on  very humid days.
80,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,pricey !!,product works exceptionally well. just a bit on the pricey side. would purchase again.
81,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definition with little flaking,"A little product goes a long way! but some flaking may occur.

82,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny Hair,This product would work great for someone who has thick or dry hair. My baby fine hair was too weighed down.It did help define curls.
83,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product woks best when applied to soaking wet hair.,"This is a crucial part of my weekly hair washing routine. My curls retain moisture, bounce and shine for a good 5 to 6 days."
84,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a staple hair care product for me.,I love this gel! This is by far my favorite. Has excellent hold without drying too crunchy or drying my hair out. Defines my curls and adds shine.
85,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Wash-n-go gel,"Literally the best wash-n-go gel for 4c hair.  I have tried so many brands, I won't even name them but this is the one I recommend to anyone who asks.  I get the most compliments using this because the curl definition with this is on point."
86,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best hair gel for curly, kinky and coily hair types","This is the best hair gel that I have ever used on my natural hair. It has a light hold, is moisturizing, and generally adds to the manageability of my hair when I want a slick pony tail or updo. I have type 3C/4ABC hair."
87,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works,"It's good. Leaves the hair a bit hard/crunchy, but it holds and if I pineapple and wear a bonnet to sleep, the style will last for Days with just a light misting of the refresher spray!"
88,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff,I love uncle funky's daughter my hair is soft and my husband loves it we needed somebody to moisturize our curls
89,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Soft and curly,My best new find. I have 4c hair. This product makes my hair curl up beautifully.  Does not have any of the harsh additives like other hair products have.  Best of all it leaves my hair soft!
90,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,This magnifies my curls a lot! Unfortunately it’s greasy and it flaked but that was after a couple of uses. But if curls are what you’re looking for it does the trick.
91,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Creates a touchable hold. Great scent. Perfect for 4C hair. A MUST HAVE!!!
92,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this hair gel,"I love this hair gel. It is really amazing. It helps hold my curls with less frizz for a lot longer. I can get a wash and go to last a few days with no touch-up. Also helps in humidity to keep my hair from puffing out. It really has become my favorite product.  Also, I like the way the bottle is because you can re-seal it when traveling which is nice."
93,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Weighed my hair down,I have fine wavy hair and using before diffusing made my hair less curly because it weighed it down. I would have been better off not using any gel. Last time I buy an expensive curl gel.
94,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Keeps my hair hydrated and with good curl definition,"From time to time I try another product, but I always come back to UFD Curly Magic Curl Stimulator.  It is the BEST!  Great curl definition.  After a day, my hair softens.  My hair feels hydrated until my next wash and go.  I do not have to do anything between wash and gos other than take steamy showers, and occasionally spritz with water.  Love, Love, Love this product."
95,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Most like Kinky Curly gel, but heavier","I really like this product.  I have been trying others with similar ingredients, but always come back to this one."
96,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,4a / 4b Hair,"I have 4a / 4b zigzag, hair and this on top of a leave in has been one of my HG for years. Soft, elongated curls without additives like glycerin which are awful if you live in a humid climate like me."
97,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Curly hair,I like the cirls it gives but it is a sticky texture. I would recommend going under a heated dryer immediately after putting it on to dry the tackiness.
98,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Curly Girls Go To Styling Gel,"I use this product on my daughter's hair and it is a curly girls go to styling gel. It is moisturizing and holds her curls well.

105,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Freakin dream come true for my natural curls,I didn’t like that the dispenser wouldn’t open up. I ordered this last month and just the other day dispenser decide to pop up on his own. Very weird other than that the product itself is amazing.
106,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best product for wash n go,"After using so many different products for my wash and go, curly magic is the best. Love the softness and definition of my hair. I didn’t get this in other brands."
107,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, poorly packed",I really like the product. I appreciate it being inside a plastic bag for shipping because the lid was not on tight and there was a lot of product in the bag. That was disappointing because of the cost.
108,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Results were amazing!,The process I used with this product to curl my hair made my curls very soft!
109,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best products I've ever purchased especially on line,"I really like this product,  anyone lookin for extra curls AMF moisture I would truly recommend"

112,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great curls, great price, healthy hair!",I LOVE this product! I’ve been looking for a good curl product to manage my curly hair for so long. I put it in when my hair is wet and use a diffuser on my hair dryer to help with the curls. It is also great for repairing my hair too! Highly recommend!
113,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product but it can be gotten for less,I was really excited I could get this from amazon.com. I paid too much for this item. I tried to cancel but I was too late. The product is fantastic
114,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Brittle Hair,Made my natural extremely dry and brittle leading to breakage.
115,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,This product left white residue in my hair.
116,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps with waves and curls,"I’m following the CGM of enhancing my natural waves. I had never heard of a product like this but it works for me.

117,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best curl moisturizer!,Love this product for wet hair to make curls more curly when dry.
118,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,Someone recommended this product in a hair group on Facebook and I'm hooked on it.. This is my go to hair productI'd be nice if you can keep it in stock!
119,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Over Priced,"This is a quality produce, but over priced.  You can find at Walmat for $9.00."
120,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't like this product,"I didn't like this product.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle and this was cheaper by the ounce.  Unfortunately it is not as good as the Shea Moisture product on my 4C kinky coily hair. This product also doesn't mix well with leave-ins.  I liked the pump and its fine as a stand along gel for edges or to refresh an old hairstyle before brushing into a buff, but not for a wash-n-go or as a styling product for kinky coily hair.This product would probably do nicely for someone with a looser hair curl pattern.  Overall its not horrible, just didn't do what I wanted it to do.  So back to Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle I go."
121,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Stuff,I like that it adds body to my perm.
122,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wrong product,Product left my hair very sticky - not for me!

126,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived broke!,Too bad it arrived broke! I guess I’ll have to pour it out! Smaller than expected!
127,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, try it. It’s worth the money!",This product is like gold milk to my hair. It does exactly what it says. I’ve been definitely losing hope with finding the right products to actually help with moisture and bring back my curl patterns.
128,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Different bottle and pump doesn't work,"The hair product itself seems just fine and the same as far as I can tell. However, this new bottle is different with a pump that will not work. I even tried putting the old pump on the new bottle to find that it is an entirely different size neck. I probably will not order again if it's going to be a hassle to change containers."
129,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING PRODUCT! Don’t hesitate to buy,"I got this for my 2b-2c waves as a curl enhancer and for a refresh product. After the first use, with just some water spritzing and this product, my hair is nearly a level 3 curl! Very exciting and highly recommend."

133,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Staple Wash n Go Product,"Love this stuff! Crunch free, soft curls. Probably not good for someone who doesn’t put oil in their hair (then you might have crunchy hair). Use it regularly for wash and goes. Staple product."
134,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for curls,This really brings my curls to life
135,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pump Broken,"I was sooooo looking forward to trying this product because I've heard so many good things about it. However, when I received it, product was everywhere in the box, the pump was busted, but the shipping box seemed perfectly fine. I also had other products in this package & they seemed fine also, just covered in this product."
136,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fast delivery of good product. A little of this product goes a ...,"Fast delivery of good product.

144,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product!,This is the best product I’ve tried on my curls. It’s a mix of gel and cream and it really stimulates the curls. I love the effect it gives to my hair.
145,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t weigh your hair down,"I like it a lot, not like other gels"
146,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best EVER,Loveeeeeeee this! Best I’ve had. It doesn’t dry your hair out. Keeps it curly and moist. I can apply some on Monday and my hair still looks curly on Wednesday. Will continue to purchase this product.

150,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing plant gel,"This gel is great, really moisturizing with surprisingly strong gold for a plant gel. For the record I have fine strands, medium density, and 4b/4c hair. This bottle will last me a while and the gel is good for one product wash and go’s so I’ll get good bang for my buck."
151,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed in shipping,The condition the product arrived is not acceptable. I was excited to use this product but it gave me beautiful results in the salon. Whoever when you buy a new product to expect it to be new and unopened.

156,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to apply. Doesn’t buildup on hair,Perfect for my type 3b/3c curly hair. Cuts back on frizz for sure
157,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky MESS!,I have 3A-3B curls.  This product left my hair sticky and...well...just plain gross.  What a waste of money.  Perhaps it works well for other curl/texture types?!
158,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the tight curls and shine,Love the tight curls and shine.  It doesn't make my hair too hard and doesn't dry it out.  I've used other products but I keep coming back to Curly magic.

171,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,♥️♥️♥️,This product was a game changer for my hair. I’m new to natural hair and after going through too many product trials these products worked with no visible flaking. My wash and go will last several days. I’m hooked. I agree that the line is pricey. But since it works so be it.
172,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works, so well!","I can tell at the end of the day when I use this product as my hair still has well formed curls, and not crazy town frizz!"

176,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go to,Best stuff out there
177,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work at all!,This product did not help my curl in anyway. It was crunchy and sticky. A complete waste of my money.
178,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,This product isn’t for all types of hair.,"Only feel the moisture putting on my hair, afterwards it starts to feel sticky.  Then when my hair dries, it feels like paper.  The product doesn’t give my hair the look that I want.  Plus, I feel it cost more than it’s worth."
179,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curl,"Haven't tried yet,but a friend uses this her hair was beautiful"
180,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Curly but crunchy,This does make my hair more curly but it is crunchy so far. I used the diffuser to dry it after application.. I am going to try it a few more times to see if I can figure out how to soften it up. The pump cap does not work and that is a pet peeve of mine

183,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, but....",Used it for a two strand twist on my 4C natural hair. And it looked great. However there was a whole lot of flaky  white stuff when it came time to take it out. I haven’t used the remainder since then.

270,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but Slimy,"I like how Curly Magic softens my coils. I just run it through my 4-b twa then leave it to dry a little before ""styling"" it. I have to admit I use it with a few other products but even when I use it with only a leave-in conditioner on damp hair, it produces a gentle, wavy-loose coil look. My only complaint is that is is very slimy so it's hard to rub in the hands to spread onto the hair causing plops of slimy product to fall on the floor."

299,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love it. The curls set and last a long ...,"I have been using Uncle Funky's Daughter for about two years.  It sat on my shelf with so many other products.  When I first tried it, I didn't follow the directions and discovered that my type 4C hair needs to be very wet.  I absolutely love it.  The curls set and last a long time.  The product also last a very long time.  The drawback, is that once the curls are set, you can not use other moisturizing products or re wet your hair because then you will have an afro rather than curls.  I now use Mizani Moisturfuse Conditioner with a heat cap for 20 minutes and Karen's body beautiful leave in for softness and moisture when I wash my hair before I use Uncle Funky's..  If I need sheen, I use Kerastase (pricy, but worth it) which also has protective qualities.  It is light, non greasy, no residue.  I also use Bed Head for shine and sealant. I can use either of these two products as often as needed."
300,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife is Very Happy with product,Just what I wanted
301,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair loves this!,"Whether as a base styler under other products or as a one and done, this is one of my all time fav, holy grail products!"

303,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product,"I love this product! great slip, easy to apply and a little goes a long way. My curls are much more defined than with aphogee. The only problem is the cost! Way too expensive and even thought it works well for my hair, I will probably look for something else."
304,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use it on wet hair while you're still in the shower,Using this has really helped define my curls.
305,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,The curls are long lasting.,"Really love this product, I got the effect I was looking for and my hair feels very soft"
306,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work for me,Didn’t help my curls hold. They fell out by end of day. Tried it with gel with no luck either.

311,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,Just sits on top of your hair and creates A LOT of build up
312,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,That it doesn’t flack
313,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lite gel,I like this product for defining my curls with shine and light weight
314,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best curling product I've tried!,"Great product for my 4C hair!  I've tried so many curling gels/jellies/creams from many product lines trying to find what would be right for me, everything from Shea Moisture, Eco Styler, Kinky Curly, As I Am, 4 Naturals, III Sisters of Nature, Taliah Waajid...and I had the same problem over and over - flaky buildup!  No matter how much or how little I used, I'd have flakes that would end up on my shirt and very stiff, dry hair.  The only thing that seemed to work was Ms. Jessie's Curly Pudding, but that's very expensive and the curl does not last long IMO.  I LOVE Curly Magic!  I tried it based on a natural hair Youtube video (look up the Pamela Samuels Young channel).  With this product, I have NO flaking, NO dryness.  It has great hold, and the bottle lasts a very long time.  I'm so glad I came across it, I don't plan to use anything else from now on."
315,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Love it! Works great for my hair.
316,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair very soft.,"No gel cast which I liked, but not enough hold."

319,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't know your hair was naturally curly.,"I Like it a lot.  If you put too much it will make your hair stiff like hair spray, if thats what you want.  But using just the right amount  give you a natural look."
320,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Me encanta,"Super, lo maximo"
321,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough,"For me, it was too thin in consistency and didn't provide enough body as Ecogel, for example, but it may work for people with much longer hair than mine."
322,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,I really love the results.
323,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pump malfunction,Ptodu t is good. The pump mechanism does not work
324,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Goes beyond definition to give you a super curl.,"Curls for days.  More curls than I could ever imagine on my kinky 4c hair.  There's no need to reapply for the second or third day because the girls aren't going away.  If I have any complaint, it's too curly! Goes beyond definition to give you a super curl."
325,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Enjoying my curls.
326,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Love this product!!!

328,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the curl it gives my hair,I love the curl it gives my hair.  But it is so sticky and some days it does not dry.  I will continue to purchase it because like I like the curl it gives my hair.
329,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Three Stars,pretty good...
330,Curly Magic,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay,"My naturally curly hair tends to like things like marshmallow root, aloe vera and more natural ingredients. This is around what my hair enjoys, but it didn't do much for me."
331,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for twist outs,"Great product to use for twist outs. It doesnt leave the hair hard and crunchy. Although it a while to dry, it keeps hair looking and feeling soft, firmly holds twist in place, and hair keeps hair hydrated without frizz."
332,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,but I'm going to add it to my list of new favorite things. The curls in my 4c hair are ...,"It is only day one of trying this gel,  but I'm going to add it to my list of new favorite things.  The curls in my 4c hair are tremendous and that doesn't happen too easily in the fall/winter months. I washed and conditioned my hair as usual.  Added my leave in and sealing products and let my hair completely dry.  The next morning I sprayed each section with water before applying the Curly Magic stimulator. The hair needs to be quite wet for the gel to work but it only takes a little.  I used a combo smoothing/finger coil technique that only takes a few minutes -then leave it be.  The curl definition really worked wonders on my hair."
333,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Natural Hair Gel...Ever!!!,I absolutely love this product. It has made all the difference in my natural hair journey. I have 4c hair and it makes my curls pop every time. I get more compliments on my hair than ever before. It’s absolutely worth every penny!!!
334,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,I love it!
335,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Great product.
336,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"Love this stuff. It's natural, light-weight, and goes a long way."
337,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of $30,"I purchased this product based on the reviews I read online.  It does NOT do what it claims.  My hair is 3c normally - this relaxed my curls instead of enhancing them, and left my hair feeling dry instead of moisturized.  Very disappointed.  Would return if my husband hadn't thrown away the box with the receipt in it but since he did I guess I'll just flush it because it's useless to me."
338,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,"It was not good for my hair, felt like a perm."
339,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,This keeps my curls popping in hot and humid climate!!!!!,This product has been heaven sent for me having moved to a tropic/humid climate. In the states I used this as a base and finished with a Devacurl or InnerSense product. Now I’m Bangkok this liquid after trial and error has alone been what are keeping my curls poppin!!!! In the shower after washing with devacurl or innersense I section clip my hair and comb the product through each section. The bottle is pretty large. Not able to find this in Asia so.......
340,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,It IS magic!!,"I've had slightly wavy frizzy hair for  most of my life. Both of my daughters have very curly hair and people were always asking where it came from. I've always dried my hair straight because whenever I would let it dry on its own to be natural, it would just be a frizzy mess within an hour of being dry.  I tried random products if they caught my eye and never really saw anything make much of a difference .One of my New Year's resolutions was to really research products that fit my hair type and see if I actually could wear my hair  with its natural wave. After reading a lot I narrowed down my curl type to 2b  And then googled products for 2b hair.  This product showed up on one review,  not hundreds, but the person's description sounded so much like my hair. I figured it was worth a shot. OMG  I actually have wavy/ curly hair!!Like a lot of people have said, the pump on my bottle did not work. Yes it has the texture of mucus,  but this product works wonders with my 2b once blonde 50 year old  hair.  I have never gotten so many compliments and people surprised to see what my hair actually looks like.  I have now bought the travel kit with five different products in it so I can test out if any others work well. I can say that this one does a great job!  My hair is fine and products tend to weigh it down but this one does not. The uncle funky's website does a very good job of saying which products go with different hair types so you can choose the products that work well for your curl pattern.  How I have been using this is getting a small amount in my hands and squishing it into my wet hair. I have also tried a light styling gel which also seems to work well with this.  My hair can even go a day or two without being washed by getting it damp and resquishing it in the morning.  Love how much this has brought out my natural hair curl pattern"
341,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Changed ingredients,"They have added glycerin, jojoba oil, and wheat protein to a product that was previously glycerin, oil, and protein free. This is not the same Curly Magic everyone knows and loves."
342,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product when used correctly .,"I really love this product so far . My hair's natural texture is very wavy with loose ringlets . It was ruined about 2 months ago by a bad haircut . After trying multiple products, curly magic has brought my hair back from the brink. This gel appears sticky coming out of the bottle but is smooth to the touch. It also does not have a strong/overpowering smell. The scent is similar to light lemongrass or ginger.  This is a tricky product to apply though. It cannot be glopped onto dry or damp hair . This gel needs to be applied to soaking wet hair and applied evenly. I rake it through my hair with my fingers, re-wet and then scrunch with a soft t-shirt . Let your hair dry without touching it and then break up any hard/stiff areas . This gel needs very little re-application for second or third day curls, just re-wet your hair and do your normal routine. It also added a nice shine."
343,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Poppin curls,I love this product.  Kept my curls poppin ALL DAY!  I also used the UFD butter cream and super curl.  Finished it off with kinky curl gel for extra hold!
344,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls That Get Attention!!!,"I have between 2c and 3a curls that frizz a lot and have no definition without some sort of gel. I ran across one person's review on some random site, and was intrigued. I bought one bottle of Curly Magic and used it right away. WOW!  My hair looked AMAZING!!! I was beside myself. I went out that night and was told by a complete stranger that I had the best curls in the whole club!! Then he corrected himself and said the whole city!  (On a high humidity night, mind you.). Next day another two different women stop to tell me they loved my curls. I'm going on my third day of beautiful hair. Thank you Uncle Funky's Daughter. I LOVE MY CURLS!"
345,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Free advice: might be cheaper if you can find it at a drug store! This stuff WORKS!,"I have been on the curly girl method for 3+ years and while I've loved the education on my curls - I was starting to get lazy and give up! The curly girl method is definitely HIGH MAINTENANCE! This working mom does not have time to wrap her head in silk every night, do weekly deep conditioning treatments, do rice water rinses and daily oil massages, etc etc.My sister told me about this and we went to Target specifically to buy this.The texture is similar to that of lube! I used it on my naked, wet curls (no leave in), wet plopped for 15 min, scrunched with a shammie for 10 min then had to air dry since I don't have 2 hours to get ready in the morning lol The wet/damp curls seemed to have a lot of definition but that's all I noticed.My air dried curls (once dried) were magnificent! Better than they have been in a while! They're even better when I blow dry them (more body).I noticed the ingredients were similar to my Bouncecurl gel and while this is not a replacement for it, it's definitely on my shelf of products I can buy at the drug store that WORK!This one is GOLD - definitely purchase it!"
346,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gentle enough even for little girl's hair!,"I love that this product is all natural! My two year old has 4b/4c hair and her curls absolutely loves this stuff! It really does bring out the natural curl pattern in her hair beautifully. Her hair is left super shiny even when it's completely dry, and it's soft to the touch. Plus, it has a really nice and clean lemony smell almost like lemon oil, but not too strong. This product only works as intended if you apply it on wet/ damp hair. It has a thick snotty consistency, so you definitely don't want to be putting it on dry hair. If you did that, you would get hard hair that has a stickiness to it. You don't want that! I would recommend using it without a leave in underneath because it might affect the results if it doesn't pair well. I use Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in conditioner sometimes and it does good, but I don't use much. I always dilute it with water and then apply the leave in. My little girl gets 2-3 day hair with this gel, but I don't mind redoing it often because her hair loves water and moisture! Whenever I need to refresh 2nd or 3rd day hair, I just lightly wet it with lukewarm water and apply a little bit more to the ends and any other sections that may need it. She shakes her head and ...Voila'! The curls separate on their own and hair is beautifully defined! I get compliments on hair hair all the time and they ask what I use. I always refer them to curly magic! Nothing has worked as good as this product so far! No build up, no crunchiness, no flaking, great natural hold, great shine, great smell, lasts a long time, and affordable! It's got my vote!"
347,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,My holy grail,"First off, I bought this at target for $15.99 for price comparison. But I am an avid amazon shopper and I tend to come here for reviews before purchasing.I LOVE this product. I have wavy (unruly) hair with occasional ringlets mixed in for fun. Without the right product, routine and prayer with every application my hair is unrestrained and willful. This product is a one stop shop for me. After all the searching and buying, layering and differing amounts...I can say that this is now my holy grail for hold, texture, humidity resistance (I live in southern Florida), and all around management.For the time being, this is the one and only product I use to style and set my hair. Absolutely worth a try. I if you purchase it from Target or Ulta, you can return it easily if it doesn't do the trick for you 👍"
348,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly girl.....3b,"Excellent product!!!  Perfect for my 3a-3b curly hair!!!  No need to use other products (i.e. gel, curl defining creme) with it."
349,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Saver!!,"I literally never leave reviews but I hope this can help another natural. My hair is like 3c/4a and colored bright red. I have been a miserable natural for 3 years because I could not perfect my wash n gos! Products that work for *everybody* (curl enhancing smoothie) did not just work for me. I found this in Target one day as I roamed the natural hair aisle and thought this just *might* work on my little stubborn curls due to it having marshmallow extract in it as my friend recommended. Sure enough, with a leave in of another brand (kinky curly) and making sure some of the Uncle Funky's was on every strand, my first successful wash n go lasted a smooth 7 days! I sprayed it with the Thirsty Curls by Uncle Funky's over that week and got tons of compliments. I finally found my lil natural stride!"
350,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, disingenuous pricing/shipping costs.","I purchased this product on Amazon last month.  It arrived within a reasonable amount of time.  I've been pleased with its results-quite pleased, in fact.  But I find the website frustrating to work through and the shipping process ridiculously disingenuous.  Having been a bit put off by the price difference on Amazon, I went to the website to order.  The prices were slightly lower---until shipping.  Not only are the shipping costs inflated, but they also increase significantly with each item.  While the items are a bit spendy, I like Uncle Funky's philosophy and could get behind paying a bit extra.  What I don't like, however, is feeling duped.  For this reason, I'm giving the hair care system a hard pass.  No thank you.  I'll stick with Shea Moisture."
351,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Long Lasting Hair Product,"Didn't get mines on Amazon. Went to a CVS store and was browsing the hair care aisle when I stumbled across this product. Brought it for $14.  I was surprised at the results. I have 4C hair and by following the instructions, I had amazing coils and curls. Didn't leave any residue or flakes after drying. Hair feels super moisturized! My only recommendation is to not get too heavy handed with the gel. A small amount goes a long way."
352,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same,"I don't think the formula was ever switched back to the original. After the original owners closed their shop and sold the entire product line, Uncle Funky's Daughter went to pits. I recommend the curl enhancer by Camille Rose."
353,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,4A/4B hair/ Don’t give up on the product,"Really a 4.5 because the product is a little tricky, and can be little sticky. But what gel isn’t. I think the stickiness gives the hold without the stiffness, like mouse but longer lasting than mouse. I have tried this product once before and did not use it correctly, so outcomes were bad. For wash and go’s (I refer to them as wash and sets), your hair has to be soak and wet, then apply the product in sections. If your hair starts drying out while you are styling, damping with water and a spray bottle. Not much product is needed. This is the only product that makes my wash and go’s last for more than a few days. Good luck!"
354,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,"I usually wear my hair straight, but I love this for when I wear it curly. My hair loves a curl stimulator, and this is the best I’ve tried. I like KCCC a lot, but it separates my curls too much. This doesn’t, and it’s more moisturizing. I think it works better on fine hair because it doesn’t work very well on my husband’s coarse hair."
355,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Defines curls beautifully!,"This product worked amazingly for my hair! The consistency is not too thick or creamy, so it doesn't weigh down my 2c-3a curls. A little on the pricey end, but it's worth it. A must-have!"
356,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk,Very very sticky and left my 4c hair dry like straw. Avoid this product!
357,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,and this never fails to define and perfect my curls like nothing else,"I keep coming back to this product.  I've tried the Shea Moisture line, Carol's Daughter, AsIAm, and this never fails to define and perfect my curls like nothing else.  I didn't use it for a week, because i misplaced it, and my hair just was not the same.  AsIAm is a very close second, but they don't have the same curl stimulator.  My hair is 3c mostly, but probably 4a/b on the sides and crown.  My curls grow in tight, perfect spirals the size of a straw.  My hair tends towards frizz, especially at the root and tip.  I've only been one year natural, so I am still learning what my hair responds to best, but UFD Curl Stimulator is one that I do not plan to be without!!"
358,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,No Glycerin but Lots of Aloe. Love it as refresh too,"I was looking for something glycerin free and grabbed this at Target for $15.99 for a 12 oz. I couldn’t wait to try, so actually used as a refresher to test it out and it did the trick. Wash day even better and works well alone too. Aloe is number 2 ingredient and if your hair doesn’t like it, be wary."
359,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,May have to give up my Eco,"I have 4c hair and I must admit that I am a big eco styler gel to have some curls..This is a great product and it’s true what other say, you don’t need a lot. I am a big fan of eco styler...have tubs of it...I may have to give it up because this is WAY better! It leaves my hair soft and the curls pop!!"
360,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what it used to be!  Read this review!!,"At one time I would strongly recommend Curly Magic.  It was a product that gave your natural wave/curl pattern a magnificent enhancement.  Then they changed the formula.  The new formula made my hair extremely dry.  I contacted the company and was told that they were going back to the old formula.  Mind you, customer service is not good.  Since it was past the return date, I could not return it to the store where purchased.  They said that I could return it to them and they would send me a new bottle.  Of course, they asked how much was in my bottle.  I had bought it, but not used it until my other bottle had been depleted.  It was a brand new bottle!  Needless to say, I did not return it to them.  However, I returned to the store and purchased another bottle which said nothing about a new formula.  I though I was safe.  However, it is not the ORIGINAL formula.  So needless to say, I have two worthless bottles of product at a cost of $30 each. I'm disappointed because once you finally find a good product for your hair, you want to be able to continue to use it and stop the search.  The search is on again."
361,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,I found 1 bottle of this at a store and grabbed it. I don’t even know what I paid for it. It’s so nice. Not hard and crunchy but holds curls well. My hair looked great once dried. I’m going to try the other products in this line.
362,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally Found It,Im in love. It came in the mail today and I just used it and my curls are on fleeeek! I have 4a hair and its beautiful!
363,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for my 3B hair.,Absolutely LOVE this product!!! It’s lightweight and not heavy on my hair.
364,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love It!,"My daughter has been using the gel for a long time. I was loyal to another brand but finally tried it and the results were amazing! My curls are silky, lightweight with a great shine! Love my natural hair and this product does too!!Now please create something to cover this grey! 🙂 #FIFTYandFAB"
365,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome, awesome product","I have never bought this product on Amazon, but have used it for several years, always buying directly from the Uncle Funky's Daughters website..  I have tried so many other curly products in the past, but NONE have come close to Curly Magic, not even the Deva Curl products. I am a white woman with 3b hair, fine in texture, but thick in volume. It does make the air drying time longer  than usual, but the end results is so worth waiting the long dry time. My curls last for at least 5-6 days in great shape with minimal frizz. I get many compliments on my hair and questions about what products do I use. I am always  happy to recommend Curly Magic, this is the only curly gel that I will use.  Some reviewers commented on the new formula. I really didn't see any difference between the old and the new in my hair, but I guess that's a very individual thing depending on your hair type.  I love this product and will use no other !!"
366,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would recommend,"This stuff is great! I just started using it to try and help figure out my waves and it’s been so nice. Smells good, easy to use, affordable and does what it’s supposed to. I will def buy it again."
367,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"Just a little sticky however, love this product.  Gives my hair great slip, shine and reduces breakage..."
368,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works on fine curly hair,"I love love this product! It gives me the shine, pretty definition while controlling the frizz! My hair actually moves & it feels light & airy!I have a lot of fine curly hair"
369,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,"Curly Magic is wonderful.But make sure you read the instructions carefully!Only a small ammount is needed after you wash your hair. This is not the kind of hair gel you can use daily. It's way too thick!A little goes a long way. Side note, you can get it cheaper($25.00) directly from Uncle Funky's website. Anything over that is a rip!"
370,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I Use this Daily on My Short, Dry, Curly Hair","I am very pleased and will purchase this again!PROS: I'm an African-American woman with natural hair. My hair is very short and curly and tends to be very dry and brittle if I don't moisturize. I've tried other moisturizing, curl defining products, but this one, recommended by my hairdresser and stylist, is definitely the best I've ever used. It moisturizes and does a nice job with curl definition. I use a quarter-sized amount, and that is more than enough.CONS: Unfortunately, this product is heavy, so it leaves my hair feeling a little sticky. I wash my hair twice per week with a gentle clarifying shampoo to remove the sticky, icky feel."
371,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for dry wavy hair,"Love it! I have dry wavy 2B/C hair that gets easily weighed down or frizzy and puffy. I have trouble finding a product that gives enough moisture without going overboard. I also need product that gives definition because wavy hair can easily get too wild. Curly Magic is perfect for dry wavy hair because it moisturizing but doesn't weigh down hair, and it defines waves and curls without the crunch or tackiness of gel. Will repurchase!"
372,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mess,"This stuff, is the worst hair product, leaves a residue, so sticky, hv to wash hair every other day"
373,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with results,"I really like this product. I have used Loma curl cream and AG Recoil (which I love), but wanted to try this and am happy with it. Super easy to pump into hand and scrunch into my hair. It has a good smell also. Not sure if I’d purchase again but I am glad I tried it."
374,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!!,"I have a mix of 4a,4b and 4c hair and this product really defines my curls! I absolutely love this gel!  I will be trying more of their products!"
375,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT...but...,"This curl is Phenomenal,  but the stickiness,  if you use too much is also phenomenal, but not in a good way.."
376,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,All day moisture~ no residue ~ a little goes a long way!,"The price was a little intimidating at first, but all the great reviews from friends made me want to buy it anyway. Wow!  It has a pleasant, clean smell and a little goes a long way.  I put a small amount on and it stayed moisturized throughput the day, never once did it get crunchy or leave a residue!  So worth it!"
377,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,The curl definition is REAL!!!,"Had been looking for something to create more definition. I was on you tube and saw a review done on this product and her hair was amazing. My daughter said she also heard the product was good. And it have DEFINITELY amazing!! Curls are defined, shiny,  stretched and its even held moisture better! The hype is real! Try it!"
378,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pump didn’t work,For a hair product that was so expensive the pump didn’t work. I never got to try it. It went back.
379,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading,"This product does not define curls, I would say if you have fine or beautiful natural curly hair it probably will define.  My hair is back to natural curl after not having a perm in over thirty years but it didn’t do anything for my hair especially after it dries,"
380,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry hair,I love it for my dry hair but beware its not very lightweight but it still let my curl pretty normal I have fine hair for reference
381,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hair product,Really good product at a reasonable price.  I’m looking forward to trying more of this line.
382,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,This works well with my natural curls.,I really like that it made my hair curl but didn't leave my hair greasy or stiff.
383,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff,Not crunchy. Soft curl definining
384,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,Making my hair stronger. Thanks!
385,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Stuff,"I love this stuff! Perfect for my thin, curly hair. I have been using Curly Magic for about 2 years now."
386,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff!!!,"Its really slippery and moisturizing. I have type 4 hair and i find that this product is a nice addition to a wash n go, or a twist/braid out! You will probably need another gel for extra shine though, even though its not ashy!"
387,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"It got to my house really fast, in hood conditions, I love how it feels in my hair, leaves my hair moisture and soft. Love it, I recommend it 100% I’ll order more in the future."
388,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair will stay funky!!! Love Uncle Funky’s Curl Magic!,Super moisturizing! Great curl lock! Not overpriced like other products!
389,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but worth it,Love the light weight feel and smell and it keeps curls well
390,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works,Just what I needed for moisture
391,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works nice,Sadly i had an allergic reaction to something in it. Otherwise would have loved it.
392,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product for natural curly hair,I love this product
393,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,I have had a hard time looking for a product that actually smells great and curls my hair. I’m Hispanic and this right here is pure magic ! I love this product.
394,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,Great! I have purchased this item from Amazon before
395,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,Nice curl pattern
396,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works,I like curl magic it does what it says it will do.
397,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good product,It works very well on my hair
398,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,The slip with this product is amazing!!!,This product is WONDERFUL!!!
399,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously most consistent, best results!","This stuff is magical! I’ve tried several gels and mousses and this by far gives me the best results every time and lasts the longest. And it doesn’t make my hair feel dry or product-y at all! And I barely do a refresh with just my fingers and a little water and it still looks great after 3 days! I love that it reactivates with water so I don’t have to put more product in my hair and it makes my refreshes so simple and easy! I’ve never found another product that does so well in my hair! Never change Uncle Funky! For reference, I have 2cish wavy/curly hair that is very fine and low-density and this doesn’t weigh my hair down at all. Couldn’t be happier!"
400,Curly Magic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice smell,Nice smell and works good with my curly hair.
401,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Product for those curls!,I have finally found a curly hair product I love! Gives your curls volume and shine and at the same time it holds those gorgeous curls!
402,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works beautifully on my hair!,"Love, love love the product.  Just wish it had a tad more hold. It's my wash day staple!"
403,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really is magic!,"I have never loved my hair as much as I do now. I am a 4c girl, and I thought I needed ecostyler to get my curls to pop. Turns out, the reason my curls were so unpredictable and unruly, was because of product buildup. I tried the oil free detox, started using shampoo every week,  ditched oils and butters. Now I just use curly magic, and my wash and go is on point and stays that way all week. If I need to refresh it a little, I just spray a little water in sections and rake my fingers through it, the curly magic is reactivated like on wash day. It rinses clean on wash day with no build up. It doesn't leave your hair hard. It is soft and shiny. I love this stuff."
404,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,This gives awesome curl definition I found go to that does what it claims,"I love the curl definition on my coily hair that squats down when it’s wet, allow it to dry W/o disturbing . Your curls are going to pop also and that not a good pic of the results. If I say more your going ti have to pay me or give a free bottle hint hint lol"
405,Curly Magic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Came broken.  Poor packaging.  Might reorder,
406,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,pump dont work,Was excited to try this product - two stars given because pump won't pop open. I must have gotten a defective one.  Have to unscrew to get product out for my hair.  Not happy about this esp for the price I paid.
407,Curly Magic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Was not happy with this product.  I wanted something like Curls up by FX and this did not come close,Just was not what I expected.  Did not keep curls in like I thought it would
408,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy with this!,I seen a TikTok video of another lady with curly hair using this so I ordered it. I’m so glad I did! My curl pattern is stunning!!! I put it in my hair when my hair is soaked still in the shower! I plop with a t-shirt and go about my business. I let my hair air dry them I scrunch the crunch out and it’s beautiful! No residue ever! I will be using this product as long as it’s available! Highly recommend!
409,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Must Have,"Really tames the natural hair and delivers shine, smoothness, and unbelievable curl length!"
410,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wash and go staple,NA
411,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,It seems to get better with use,
412,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Love this product
413,Curly Magic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best product for my hair.,I’m hair stay moist.
414,Curly Magic,Size: 1.12 Pound (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Me encantó. Es natural y mi cabello ondulado quedó muy definido. Queda una ligera sensación tipo gel al secarse que puedes dejar para mayor duración o removerla haciendo scrunch scrunch en el cabello. Excelente producto.
0,Thirsty Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yesssssssssssss!,"I have curly, high porosity bleached hair. It is SO HARD to find something that refreshes without causing frizz and actually hydrating my curls. This is, hands down, the best refresher I have ever used. EVER. The same night I got it, I used it on my hair after a work out- and my curls hydrated so well- they became plump and juicy. Even more so than after my wash and go. I used it this morning as well on some stretched curls after sleeping on them, and the same thing happened. Curls instantly came back. I saw some of the reviews- and maybe your level of porosity has something to do with it- or if you hair does not agree with coconut anything- but just wow. I'm in love. Alternatively if you feel this is too heavy or not moisturizing enough (I can't agree) but you can also try using the leave in (midnight train) to refresh. I did so before getting this, and although it did not hydrate as much as this did- it definitely was a great refresher. A must for high porosity curls! Bonus- NO ITCHY SCALP like you get with some other refreshers. Looking at you DevaCurl."
1,Thirsty Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"This stuff does not agree with my hair. I gave it three stars because it could just be that my hair hates it. As all curly girls know, not all curls are created equal, after all. But it makes my hair crunchy and frizzy, and not in a soft, manageable way."
2,Thirsty Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works...but,"I am still searching for the best day after curly hair product, this one is just OK. You definitely get the curl back, nice! It kinda dries my dry hair out and it feels like there is weird texture on it, not nice."
3,Thirsty Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,it’s ok,"more chemically than i expected it to be and leaves my hair feeling like there is something on it (gel-like crunchiness). it’s minimal, but i don’t like that feeling, so it isn’t something i’ve added to my routine.but i have used this a few times when i’m quickly washing my hair and leaving the house because it does hold my hair without me worrying if it’s going to dry nicely. i use it after ‘curly magic’ (which is another product that really adds to the super curly look)"
4,Thirsty Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me.,"I recently went natural with my hair and although this spray smelled great and may work on coils, but made my curls sticky, frizzy and dried out. I found the product to be pretty heavy, I have better luck refreshing my hair by holding my head under the faucet and drenching my curls. However I must add that The Uncle Funkys  shampoo and conditioner are great and I highly recommend those."
5,Thirsty Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for high porosity natural hair,I wear a short wash and go and I use this product everyday to refresh my curls. This is a great product for high porosity hair!
6,Thirsty Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,2B/C - 3A curls don't like it,"My hair is runs between 2B/C and 3A curl types (so it gets frizzy easily, looses its hold quickly, and always needs a refresh every day). Unfortunately this doesn't work for a refresh, so I'm trying it out as a moisture lock-in prior to my other products. I LOVE the Curly Magic and Good Hair products from Uncle Funky's so I think this is more of a ""me"" hair thing than an ""all"" hair thing."

37,Thirsty Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,An essential part of my regimen!!,"I believe this product is meant to refresh curls in the morning, but using it that way didn’t do much for my 4c hair. One night, on a whim, I decided to use it to moisten sections of my hair before twisting them, and now I’m in love!I spray until the section of my hair is moist but not soaking wet, add a tiny bit of light oil, detangle if needed, and then twist. In the morning my hair is suuuuuper soft, shiny and manageable. I now do this every night and wash my hair every 7-10 days (because after about a week, there is buildup). I’ve also found that I can add it to a spray bottle- half water and half curl revitalizer, and it still works perfectly :)"

51,Thirsty Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I have tried a lot of products for curly hair but this is the tops!
0,Glossy,2.0 out of 5 stars,It contains silicone,"I did not realize it had a silicon derivative in it. I don't like using those on my hair or skin.According to the ingredient list on Amazon, the silicon is low on the list, but they have changed thatand now it's the first ingredient on my bottle.!Also, the smell was literally nauseating.  It was so sweet that I thought I might toss my cookie.I threw it out."
1,Glossy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glossy,I love this product. I first discovered it at Sally's Beauty supply store. Then I couldn't find it anywhere. I finally checked Amazon and they had it. This is a great product for curly or straight hair. I put it on last and it gives my hair a glossy and rich look. Its not oily or greasy like some glosses. It smells good and I really like it.
2,Glossy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice but very smelly and oily,This product looks nice on my hair but is a little too oily and the smell is pretty strong. I expected a better result for the price. It's a nice product though.
3,Glossy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy,"It’s a little too greasy for my fine 4a hair. Also, the citrusy scent stays for a long time. Would have returned items, but would have had to pay for shipping both ways."

The curls just spring to life! Add a water-based holding gel & my curls are beautifully set for many, many days. My hair is soft & moisturized.  All this good, without flakes! The product really is magic! I am a happy customer for life!"
14,Glossy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,Would like the price to be a little less
0,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product is amazing... BUT BUY THE 12OZ not 18OZ,"before I tell you how good the product is-- BUY THE 12OZ!! Not the 18oz. It is cheaper per ounce.the 12 oz is usually $15.the 18 oz is usually $30... paying twice as much for only 1.5 times the product!I've found local places and Target are reliable for the good price on the 12 oz.Okay... this was my first new hair gel try in years that I have loved.I have 3a hair and have used the ""Curls"" blueberry and passionfruit gels and other products for probably 6 years. I wanted to try out some new products after seeing so many more on Tiktok that weren't available in my local stores curls section.This is INCREDIBLE!! My curls have never looked shinier and better. It holds well but softly, smells so good, and lasts forever. I bought this 18 oz for $30 in March or April 2020 and it lasted until January 2021. Almost a whole year. I have had very short hair for most of this year, but I am a notorious over-producter (the curls need moisture!!) and I use a pump or two everyday. I am obsessed."
1,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!,Love this product! My stylist recommended I use it and now I'm hooked on all of their products.I was using DevaCurl before this and there was a lot of build up and residue on my scalp from the creme leave in.I use uncle funky's after the shower now and my hair feels light and soft. My curls don't get fuzzy and I can make them last for multiple days. I wear my hair short and have tight curls. I've given it to friends with long hair and they love it too. It's also really great to smooth down edges and get a clean pony-tail. Could not recommend more :)!
2,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft Long-Lasting Curls,"The product does work, but I have an afro so it's a little limited. If you have hair like mine, don't expect bangin' poppin' bouncy curls. It more brings out your natural curl pattern and your hair will be soft. I've found it work best if you put your sopping-wet-freshly-washed hair in sections and do at least a pump per section (smaller sections, not quarters, go root to tip) and diffuse (blow dry) your hair until it's not wet and sticky (it can air dry the rest of the way) so that the product sets the curls nicely and the curl pattern holds strong for up to a week. Overall, I'm happy with the product and I will order again."
3,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wash n go,Great for wash and go. Needs hair to be dripping wet. Check YouTube for vids on application.
4,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ingredients added protein and glycerin,"I started using this product about a year ago because it was one of the few protein, glycerin and coconut free products I could find for my kids’ low porosity hair hair. I was so pleased with the softness and hold with fantastic ingredients, no bad preservatives. Then their hair started to feel dry a few weeks back with nothing changed in our hair routine. I finally took a look at the ingredient list and saw that they added wheat protein and glycerin and took out chamomile extract. Basically added the stuff I was so pleased it did not have. It finally made sense why I was struggling suddenly. Protein hardens my kids hair and now it’s one of the top ingredients. *sigh* why can’t these companies stick to the original formula? It’s already so hard to find protein free products out there. I will not be purchasing again."
5,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Wavies too!,I have wavy 2c/3a hair and after 25 years of straightening my hair have decided to embrace my natural waves and curls. This is awesome. I only have to use 2-3 pumps for my entire hair and I follow with a light gel for some extra hold. This does not leave my hair hard or crunchy and helps me get more defined curls. Definitely a go to for me.
6,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent for fine hair, chemically curly hair, or wavies!",I have very fine hair that is permed. I struggle to find products that enhance my curls without weighing them down since I'm not a natural curly. This stuff is excellent! It leaves a great cast and my curls look so defined and bouncy after I scrunch out the crunch! I just use it over my Blueberry Bliss Leave In and I'm good to go!
7,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go to for my wash & goes,I have tried many products when it comes to wash & goes and I can honestly say that Uncle Funky's Curly Magic Curl Stimulator is exactly what my hair needs. I live in AZ where the weather is hot and dry. This products adds tons of moisture  to my hair and my wash & goes last longer. I have seen a definite change in my hair health. I love it!
8,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No flakes, no flakes, hurray","Love, love, love Curly Magic! No flakes on my wash and go, plus it really gave me an all week hold! Curls were still in place at the end of the week and not hard and crunchy. Do you know what that means for someone who is truly busy! Can't wait to try this on a twist out."
9,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curling Gel Dream,"First off, this product is a GEL and not a curl cream or anything of that variety. I thought it was a curl cream but when I realized it was a gel I still gave it a try, and wow!! I have about 2A -B hair most days and this easily transformed my natural waves into CURLS. The pictures are from the previous day using my normal products and the next day only changing out my normal gel for Uncle Funky's. What a difference it made! The gel cast was good, not crazy firm but still good. The smell is fairly strong when applying, but I can't smell it on my hair at all now. You do get a big bottle so I feel like the price is worth it for how well it works. I'm very pleased with this product and would gladly purchase more!"
10,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product but received an open bottle.,"I want to start by saying I love this product.Originally I bought the trial size from target and thought I hated it because I applied it to damp hair and it didn’t have that slippery feeling.Then I went to a coily hair stylist (earnestlynatural in Raleigh, NC) and she taught me 1) reading is fundamental and 2) always apply in the shower, to soaking wet hair.. like the bottle says.So after she performed actual magic on my head (see last photo) I decided to get the product for myself so I can start doing my own wash and goes. I ordered a full sized bottle but when it arrived, as you can see, the product was spilling out of the container. This gel isn’t cheap (rightly so), so any product loss feels like a waste of money. I am currently working on getting a refund and reordering so hopefully I have better luck with the next shipment.Also last thing, I highly recommend looking up Iamblackgirlcurl, throw out the lco and loc methods, and change your life."
11,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,New different formula,"The new formula has jojoba oil as the fourth ingredient, the old one has none of this ingredient. They also added glycerin as the second ingredient. It was also not present in the old formula. Why did they tamper with it? It was legendary."
12,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the BOMB!!,"1st, Hair Type: I have 2C-3A hair that falls about mid-back. 2C-3A hair means tighter waves with loose ringlets mixed in.2nd, The Search: I have searched, and researched and purchased product after product looking for that golden ring of hair products. (Its a reference. Look it up) Products that don't have phosphates, parabens, silicones etc, don't leave me with ramen noodle hair, or look greasy, or feel sticky, or smell like Mrs. Marcus's dollar store Floral Delight perfume that she pours all over herself before she sits down in the church pew right in front of me. Every time. I swear, that woman must have brain damage from the fumes by now.3rd, Discovery!: Uncle Funky's Daughter Products! The Curly Magic is just that, MAGIC BABY!! It has none of the bad ingredients and smells great.  It is a gel, but acts more like a custard. It provides great wavy curl hold without frizz. It does not feel sticky or gunky. No greasy, I used way too much product, look either.Uncle Funky's Curly Magic is exactly the curly gel I was looking for.All hair is different of coarse, but I cannot recommend this enough.Another Uncle Funky's Daughter product you should try is the Heal and Renew mask. Excellent!!"
13,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Full bouncy curls,This is amazing to help bounce and spiral curls for my type 3A type curls (works best on my wet hair) and then defuse for crunchless curls. Love this and the thirsty curls for next day curls.
14,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Product Ever!!,"I began using this product went I first went natural 8 years ago. It was my staple product, I them backtracked and now I'm beginning a new hair journey with this amazing product again. It truly moisturized my hair from root to tip and keeps a gorgeous shine. I also use it on my 6 year old daughter's hair. 100% natural ingredients and it shows."
15,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously, Saw This On TikTok","I saw this on TikTok and loved the results so I gave it a try.  I have 2C-3A, color treated and highlighted hair and it can be a challenge to set and hold a curl sometimes.  I used this in conjunction with a generic firm hold gel, raked it through wet hair, plopped for a half hour and then dried with an infrared diffuser.  FRIZZ IS NON-EXISTENT!!!!  I was amazed! I got decent volume with no frizz and I can get several days out of a single style by using a satin night cap and lightly spritzing with water, scrunching in more curly magic in the morning, and diffusing again.  This product just took a huge chunk out of my morning routine and has left my hair looking extremely healthy while defining and holding my curls.  Try it - it's worth the dollars!"
16,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Defined Curls!,My stylist recommended this product. I can use it after rinsing out conditioner without applying a Leave-in in first. It is great for fine hair like mine.  Love the definition!!
17,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,White Dust Galore,"If you want to shower everyone with white dust every time you turn your head too fast, this is the product for you. Smells good, looks ok- but the white cloud of dust hovering around me is just too much drama. Forget wearing black or dark colors unless you like the dusty look there too."
18,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pure Magic!,"I wasn’t certain what to expect from using Curly Magic as I have fine, thin, wavy-when-it-feels-like-it hair.  My hair has gotten thinner and more damaged looking over the last year, likely due to pandemic-fueled stress and normal aging.  Anyway, I bought this a week or so ago, and cannot believe how much my hair has changed!  I have my waves back, and my hair is glossy and healthy looking.  I also started using Uncle Funky’s Daughter Shampoo at the same time, but I know that this was the “key” to my lost waves.Application suggestion:  My first try with this didn’t give great results, but that is because there is a bit of a learning curve with any product and I wasn’t using enough.  I went from using 1 pump to 3 and that made all of the difference!  I don’t use any conditioner, as this and the shampoo together are conditioning enough.  Thank you so much for an amazing product!"
19,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Painfully Worth Every Penny,"After communicating an error in the size of the product that I received vs. the size I had ordered, the seller has graciously and generously corrected the issue.  So, now I can say, this product works wonders for those of us with VERY curly, VERY thick, VERY full, VERY coarse; and LOTS of hair!! It takes only a small amount in comparison to similar products, you'll have to adjust for your particular type of hair.  It moisturizes and has a nice, soft hold and can be refreshed for a couple of days with a spritz of water. So, while the upfront investment may seem a bit steep, you should be able to justify the cost with performance and staying power."
20,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good stuff,"I have 2b - 3a hair, straightish underlayer, just past shoulder length hair. Medium porosity and fairly protein sensitive. I try not to use too many products with Shea butter and hydrolyzed proteins, or at least not all at once, to make sure the moisture/protein ratio stays balanced so my hair doesn't feel like straw.My current routine is to squeeze out extra water in the shower but don't use a towel to dry. I emulsify and rake through Shea moisture curl enhancing cream, then use a small amount of mop top jelly on areas that need a bit of extra sealing (I get bad crown frizz), then a couple quarter sized amounts of curly magic from ends up, squishing and scrunching, then diffuse.Because my hair is only wavy in sections I prefer to use a strong hold gel that leaves a cast so the curl pattern holds up when I scrunch out the crunch later in the morning. I can also wait to scrunch later in the day if I want to preserve the hold for a night out because this dries without the ""weird Al"" effect. My hair is absolutely beautiful either way, no flaking!! It is similar to kinky curly custard in this way, but for me the results are softer overall.The very few cons: I find is that the cast doesn't come back if I refresh with a bit of water... Maybe this is due to less nettle? Not sure, but this definitely isn't enough to detract from it's overall performance in my opinion. Also, if I scrunch out too much crunch I can tend to get frizzy pretty quickly so maybe I just need to add a drop of jojoba oil to the routine. Lastly, because this so easy to scrunch I tend to get residue on my hands that becomes sticky in any kind of moisture, and I really really hate having sticky hands.One of my favorite things about this product is how versatile it is. I can layer it on top of pretty much anything and it helps generally with extra hold and frizz containment. That being said, those who need additional frizz prevention might benefit from something additionally emollient to seal the cuticle, especially if diffusing."
21,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,love/hate relationship,"I really want to love this product. I use it with Supercurl and it definitely elevates the type of curl (i’m usually 2b/c), making them big and bouncy. It’s very different from my normal look (people actually comment asking what I’ve used/done), but they stay light and relatively nice to touch (I do not like feeling product in my hair. I can feel this, but it’s tolerable).However, this is single day product to me. I’ll wash my hair in the morning, use both products, and need to wash it when I get home. If I don’t wash it, the next day it feels a bit gross (almost slimy and clumpy) and gets very tangled, which is not a normal issue for me. Despite this, I would recommend because I know I can use it in a pinch."
22,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hair gel I’ve ever used!!!,"This gel is AMAZING!!! It’s cruelty free and full of good stuff like ALOE(2 Nd ingredient!), marshmallow, nettle and vitamin E. It’s SUPER light but sooo moisturizing and rich at the same time. It’s the first thing I’ve tried that allows me to do a wash & go! Once it dries just a rub through my hair removes the light cast, and my hair super soft. A must have if your hair is fine (I’m mixed with 3c curls). I just did the “big chop” and couldn’t find ANYTHING that worked for me until this— I LOVE IT!!!"
23,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells nice and does its job well!,"First of all, I love the natural ginger-y scent of this product. It's very fresh and not artificial. Indo need to be careful with this product as my fine, wavy hair will get over moisturized if I use this with a leave- in or use too much. After playing around with amount and other products to use it with (and even by itself) I have found that it provides a light cast (crunch) in my hair that can easily be scrunched out, it refreshes nicely on day 2 and 3. And it does stimulate more curls. I really enjoy this product."
24,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wasted money on another bad product,"It didn’t work on my coarse, 3a curls at all! It had promise. When wet, it immediately felt stiff and clumped my curls. As soon as I started to diffuse, frizz started to separate out of the curls. Now that it’s almost dry, there essentially are no curls. It’s just a big, soft, fluffy mess. I have very low porosity, very dry hair. There is normally no such thing as too much moisture for me, so I don’t think that’s it. I have no clue what this product did to me, but I absolutely hate it. It is WAY over priced and simply NOT worth it."
25,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Magic!,"I don't know how long I have waiting for the holy grail of hair care products for my tresses, but I have finally found it! This stuff truly is magic in a bottle. I love the smell, the slip, definition and the hold. Since following the ""Wash Your Damn Hair"" hair care routine : Shampoo, condition and Curly Magic are all I need as a natural and my hair, sanity, and time, is better for it."
26,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Curly Magic!!,"This gel makes my 4c coils pop, pop, POP!!Absolutely love this product and it does not dry out my hair, unlike some other gels.  On the contrary, it keeps it moisturized.  It has really been a wonderful addition to my healthy hair routine."
27,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Review would’ve been better if it arrived in better condition.,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   The rating would’ve been higher for the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curly Magic Curl Stimulator if it wasn’t for the condition of the product upon arrival. I read some of the reviews here that take time to mention that the product container arrived leaking or the pump was broken upon arrival, so I contacted Amazon, trying to stress that they take care to pack it so that it doesn’t arrive broken. I mean, it is an expensive product, so take care that it arrived well so we can get our money’s worth.  Well, it arrived, and not only was it leaking through the bag that they wrapped around the bottle, getting the other contents in the box covered (one item was to be a birthday present!!) but, when I tried to engage the pump, it was broken, hence why it was leaking how it was. I am absolutely disappointed. Why can’t they pack it where the pump is to the side and the bottle is topped with a screw top??Since I can’t really comment on the full use of the product, since the pump isn’t working, and i couldn’t fully follow directions on the bottle, I will say, based on trying to use the product without pump that it is good.  Maybe I used too much, maybe I used too little, but, not my fault if the item arrived broken, right?!?  It moisturized my hair, pronounced my curl a bit, is lightweight for my 4 hair. Good for summer.Will I buy it again?  If it’s available nearby where I can purchase it in store, or if it’s packaged differently where nothing gets damaged during shopping (as in screw top with pump mechanism to the side, that you can assemble yourself), certainly. But otherwise…And now, if you don’t mind, I have to find a replacement pump to try to use this product properly."
28,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle at last!,"Only product I use now!  I have tight curls that always frizzed. Frizz doesn't exist anymore! And I have cut 15 minutes out of my morning routine! Now I just wash, squeeze out excess water, and apply liberal amount and finger comb it through.  Air dry usually, but diffuse drying works too! This is the miracle product I've been looking for, for 26 years!"
29,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,no no no,This product has nettle leaf in it.  If you have sensitive skin I would NOT buy this.  I had the worst allergic reaction on my scalp that migrated to my back anywhere my wet hair with product touched.  I looked insane with a rash and blisters.
30,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Need curl definition? Here it is!,"My curls are 3B-3C, and this product has been great for providing curl definition without the crunch of gel. It is almost, almost my Holy Grail product- great slip, no residue, and holds up in humidity. It's a bit heavy, so apply it little by little. It is definitely worth a try for curlistas. I use it with Shea Moisture products and got great results. Because inquiring minds want to know: I am Caucasian with tight, tight coils of Middle Eastern origin. This product has made a real difference in defining my curls. Also the product name is cool! It's pretty darn close to magic..."
31,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,1000 Stars!,"Real talk, I have had the serrious blues because I have quarantine hair.  I've been natural for 20 years and I've worn my hair low for 20 years and I have no clue how to style or do my hair.  Whatever hair styling skills I had 20 years ago are long gone.  My hair is the longest it's been in 20 years (about 2 inches).  I got my Uncle Funky's Daughter products today, I used them immediately, and I'm a dedicated, loyal customer for life already.  I'm telling you, right now I want to order more stuff from Amazon just so my UPS driver can see my hair.  I'm even contemplating letting my hair grow after quarantine because I'm so in love with these products.  Nahhh, let's not get crazy.  Oh, and I didn't use a ton of product like I've been using with other lady's daughter's products where my hair sucked up the product and left my hair looking crazy an hour later."
32,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY: dries out hair and pump doesn’t work,"The product came BROKEN and LEAKING. The product spilled all over the cardboard box that it was delivered in. It was so bad that I couldn’t even return it because I didn’t know how to package it. The pump didn’t have a proper spring so I could not pump the product out,I had to unscrew the top which made application even more inconvenient and messy.I let all of this slide hoping that the product itself would be worth the money. Unfortunately, the product itself sucks. It really dried out my hair and it did not keep any curl pattern. Instead it made my hair grow frizzy and expand horizontally making my long curly hair look like a brushed out fro rather than a well moisturized mane. Curly girls BEWARE!I am never buying hair products or any liquid from amazon again, this isn’t the first time I had issues with hair product deliveries from amazon."
33,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is pretty good!,I have mostly 4C texture it does more for adding texture to make coils in my hair than everything else. My co workers have all asked what I used on my hair this time. It does however take a bit more time to dry than with all the other gels and creams I've tried. But the coil pattern has lasted 6 days in some areas (not effected so much by rough sleep) but I will continue to use it and I will try other products from the colection.
34,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome gel with no oils/butters!,Love this gel for my type 4 natural hair! I started doing the 30 detox for no oils/butters and I'm amazed at how moisturized my hair feels days after using this product! I get great definition and reduced frizz! It takes awhile to air dry but worth it!
35,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE this product!  All curly hair ladies, this is a MUSY HAVE in the hair arsenal","Love this product!  My sister gave me my first bottle  February 2021 and it lasted me almost 5 months.I use it at the end of my hair routine.After cowashing, I place leave in conditioner in my hair and comb that through.Then I will dry my hair slightly with the towel.Last I will pump one or two pumps of Curly Magic into my hand and distribute this equally throughout my hair with my hands and fingers.When my hair naturally dries it has curls that hold, have definition; are not frizzy, and my hair is still soft and touchable.Now I am a huge fan!"
36,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff,"FYI: for best results, scrunch this into WET hair...like seriously, still dripping. I let mine air dry from there and it gets super stiff, but once it's dry you can scrunch again with just your dry hands and break the cast. To avoid frizz, try not to mess with it until it's dry and you're ready to break the cast. As it began to dry I had my doubts, but it's surprising how defined and soft my waves were once it was all done. I will repurchase."
37,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Great,I have very tight curls and this product for my kind of hair makes it feel icky and dry. I used it a handful of times to see if it was just the way I was using it or maybe just that day but it was like this all the times. I don’t recommend it for tight curled haired people. It also felt a bit heavy on my hair with a quarter sized pump on my hand.
38,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally,"Finally found a product that works for me after almost trying every natural hair product there is.  I initially ordered the trial/travel pack.  I usually style my natural hair in twist out or braid out.  It lasted 5 days. Refreshed using leave-in conditioner every other day or so.  So far I am loving this stuff.  I would surely recommend Uncle Funky's daughter products. My hair is white/gray and does not have an effect on the color. No flakes, and keeps hair moisturized and soft. Looking forward to testing other product in this line.  Please do not change the formula.I will try to add pictures on an update."
39,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Curled but crunchy,"I could never get a wash and go before I used this product.  I wash and used Knott Today conditioner and add this curly magic and my hair immediately turns curlier.  It can be shingled, twist, or pull through with a comb--hair automatically curls.  HOWEVER, hair is  crunchy and hard when dries. So I will need to find a way to work around the crunchiness."
40,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Yuck!,"I tried this product because I heard so many people rave about it. Was very excited. Now so disappointed. This gel glopped in strings in my hair and deposited white dried pieces of gel throughout my hair. It looked like I had a peeling scalp  or out of control large flakes of dandruff (neither of these problems do I have). When I scrunched out the crunch, flakes fell out of my hair like I had just put flour in my hair. I was so embarrassed. Not even the cheapest store brand gel has ever done this to my hair. I will not ever buy any of these products again."
41,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t like this product,I dislike this product because of how it makes my hair look and feel.It makes it looks like it dry dirty and when you comb it out it looks like you have a lot of dandruff
42,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken pump,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   How do you get the pump to work ?  The pump will not work no matter which way i twist or turn.  Can the company send a new one ?"
43,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Defective mechanism,Usually I don't have time for reviews but I am not happy with this company. I bought this product for my curly hair and was looking forward to using it. When I received it the pump mechanism did not work so I had to return it. They charged me a return fee which I specifically asked not to happen as the product was DEFECTIVE. I think the company should uphold the quality of their product and never charge for something that is defective. Disappointed and will not order again.
44,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enhances Curls,I really love this product. My stylist introduced me to it and now I cannot go without. My curls are defined and beautiful. My curls last for days.
45,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,SUPER STICKY,"It was harsh to pay so much money for this product. $33.  It has marshmallow in it and is super sticky.  It holds some curl, but if you get sweaty at all your curls will stick to your neck from the marshmallow in the product.  It is really really gross!!"
46,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of curls,"Already use the moisture, added this to my arsenal to fight wayward sorta curly sorta not hair. Doesn’t take a whole lot to crunch through and let me tell you, it grabs those unruly strands and commands their attention! I find, (during winter) I do let it dry naturally but it takes a very long time, so I hit it with the blow dryer to finish it off, works like a charm! Body, curls, shiny. What else, right?"
47,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing for my 2c waves/curls,"This stuff is amazing on my hair. I use it after leave-in conditioner and it slightly “seizes” the curls where they need to be. Then I plop, diffuse/air dry, and then gently scrunch. Holds my soft waves, not heavy at all on my fine hair. I can use some gel if I want a stronger hold but it’s typically all I need for working from home these days."
48,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Came damaged with product all over,"I love this product and usually purchase it at my hair salon but I decided to just go with Amazon! The box was handed to me so I know it was not the fault of the delivery guy! I opened and the product was everywhere in the box. I took the bottle out and the pump wasn’t working! Thank God, I didn’t throw away my old one, I had to switch the pumps and throw away the new one! Very disappointing for an expensive product"
49,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great finisher for curly hair,My favorite wet gel! Gets my curls perfect every time!
50,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Curly Magic,"Tried Curly Magic for the first time in combination with a different brand of Almond & Avocado Curl Defining Creme Gel. I works great in my hair and the curls were poppin'.  The Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic reminds of the way DEVA curl smells, which is not my favorite, but will do because it works well.I would consider buying this product again if I don't find a better curl product."
51,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT FOR MY FINE NATURAL HAIR,"This product is amazing and I hope they never stop making it or change the formula. It defines my fine textured natural hair without making it hard or weighing it down. I should add, I have a TWA. It leaves my hair shiny, define and adds a little volume.  I don't know my hair type, but if I were to guess I would say its 4a and 4b. I would recommend this product."
52,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect amount of hold,"I’ve tried several different gels but keep coming back to this one as it seems to have just the right amount of hold for my hair type. I have medium/coarse hair, low density, low porosity, and a mixture of type 2a and 2b waves. This is my go-to gel when I need to reset my hair and don’t feel like experimenting with other hair products."
53,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Softens and defines curls,"I like the look that this product makes my hair curl, but it is very sticky possibly due to the aloe vera as part of its ingredients.  It’s not cheap, and I wonder if making my own formula with aloe would have the same effect.  It was worth a try, but too exp since I wash my hair two to three times a week."
54,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Defines curls and hold them for days on end.,"This is my favorite product for a wash and go. The secret is to apply a lot to soaking wet hair. I apply mine in the shower after coating with a leave in cream, and then I top it with a good hold gel. This (along with my wash routine) helped to normalize my previously high porosity hair. Highly recommend."
55,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am too lazy to do reviews, this product deserves it... AMAZING on black natural hair","specially for wash and gos! love it love it.Tips: use your leave in and keep your hair as wet as possible, take very small pieces of hair and take the gel with your fingers! Diffuse afterwards of possible."
56,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Defined curls and shine,I love the product it works well with everything I use or can be used by itself have great curl definition and shine for days  the only negative thing is the price is high but I would repurchase
57,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Straight or curly, best gel for texture and hold.","Ok, this stuff is so nice! My hair does great with this whether I blow dry straight or defuse for curls.  Lightweight, soft, smells fresh.  Highly recommend this gel regardless, especially if you don't want a heavy hold. By that I mean, it holds amazing but your hair feels soft and touchable.  Best hair gel on the market, hands down!"
58,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A little slick and sticky, but with the right amount it’s great!","Love me some uncle funky! No frizz with this stuff, just curls! I would recommend to all my sisters with super dry hair and frizzy from birth. Put in your favorite conditioner and pump a little in your hand and go theough your hair. Then comb it through with a big comb it keeps the curl pattern going all day"
59,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,No,I followed the instructions but its not as they advertised on Instagram. I have a curly hair. Sinc I'm using this product all my curls are gone and my hair looks frizzy
60,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it.,Gurl! My 4c high porosity hair LOVES this stuff. Lifetime customer now for sureee
61,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does not leave hair dry!,"I've used several different gels that have all left my hair dry and brittle.  This gel works wonders!  I have been natural for 8 years.  I did not use gel consistently for the longest because I didn't like how it made my hair feel after applying it. Went to a hairstylist, she used this on my hair and I was amazed at how well it moisturized, yet provided hold but didn't make my hair feel ""crunchy"" or look dry.  I have ran out of this and tried using other gels hoping that maybe applying the others a different way would provide a different result to no avail.  This gel is absolutely amazing! I've been using it for the past 2 or 3 years, a game changer!"
62,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"What I like about the curly magic is that you don't have to use a lot to get the curls you need, it smells good and has like a slimy texture but it works very well on making the natural hair very curly and using with the rest of the Uncle Funky's Daughters line will make your hair nice soft and bouncy."
63,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wave magic!,This stuff really is magical! Creates beautiful clumps for my 2b-2c waves. It smells nice and the ingredients are so natural. Will definitely be purchasing again.
64,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light and easy,This product works great on my coily curly hair. It looks like snot - but it’s important to put the product on the hair when it is wet from the wash. I personally let it dry naturally and the curls seem to stay elongated. The curl refresher works well to freshen up the curls daily. But it is all very light on the hair.
65,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff.,"I love this stuff it’s great with all of the Uncle Funky’s products, and has great slip."
66,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best hair cream,"The texture was heavy, leaves my hair very coarse. Won’t buy again."
67,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,D,I bought this product for my daughter bc she was looking for a natural curly look to her hair. It Adds a nice looking curl BUT… it leaves a white clumpy film on the hair. I wouldn’t buy this product again. It was not worth the money
68,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like magic!,"I have curly, fine hair... Must be applied to soaking wet hair. Dries soft and shiny. I have tried the curly girl method for the last 7 years, without much luck. I found out about Uncle Funky's from a YouTube video.  I thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did. You you want to get rid of frizz, this is a must try"
69,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Staple Hair Gel,"I have been using Uncle Funky's Daughter consistently since it was recommended to me by my stylist.  I love it!  It has great moisturizing qualities and I receive so many compliments on my wash and go hairstyles.  There is a slight learning curve with the product.  A little goes a long way.  Once you learn what works for your hair, I believe you will agree, it is a great product!"
70,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"very moisturising..soft , smells good to me but it does not give much hold... every hair condition will love it whether you have hydrated or dehydrated hair. should be added with another product to give hold if your hair is dehydrated .. if your hair is hydrated.. you will give this 10/10... love that is a botanical gel"
71,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not Great!,I like the initial shone but after it dries it does flake. There is major cast. But if you wet it looks ok. I also have a problem with keeping it in the fridge because if I forget to put it back...im worried all day if it is going to spoil. But it ok. I like the natural ingredients.
72,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Products good /packaging bad,The entire pump missing.. but waited and needed so i transferred to another pump‼BUT NATURAL HAIR WILL LOVE‼ THIS PRODUCT...the extra butter is good too‼$$ fot amount 8oz...and not only half full.‼ These products make going natural (hair) easy  👍🏾
73,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,"On all the Curley girl sites women rave about this so I had to try it . I have tried just about every product and this by far is the best.  I love the way my hair came out , way more manageable. Would highly recommend!!!"
74,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product.  Amazon price a little higher than in stores.,"Great for my natural hair.  Makes my hair easy to comb, no greasiness and stays moisturized for at least a week!  A bit sticky before it drys. Cheaper in stores if you can find it.  Shelves are usually empty.  Easier to order from Amazon."
75,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly hair!,I’ve been using this product for a while and I absolutely love it! It’s definitely strengthened the curl in my hair and doesn’t leave your hair stiff. Maximum results with minimum effort.
76,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love This Stuff!,"I’ve been on this natural hair care journey for a long time, so I’ve tried multiple products. I originally just didn’t like the name and wouldn’t purchase until I got a referral. My hair (4C) is super soft and you don’t need much. A little goes a long way."
77,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Miraculous non greasy, shiny, springy curls!",Truly a miracle. I just cut my hair off and decided to go natural. What a game changer. I now have wash and go hair.Thank you!

79,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my med-high porosity frizz-prone curly hair,I have a lot of curly hair stylers that were either too heavy for my hair or made my hair frizzy and sticky.  This one is perfect and it works really well to fight frizz even on  very humid days.

81,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definition with little flaking,"A little product goes a long way! but some flaking may occur. I usually apply a bit of oil after this product.Use on very wet hair (remember, towel drying is the enemy!) then use your hands to scrunch the curls.Hope this is info is helpful to you!"
82,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny Hair,This product would work great for someone who has thick or dry hair. My baby fine hair was too weighed down.It did help define curls.
83,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product woks best when applied to soaking wet hair.,"This is a crucial part of my weekly hair washing routine. My curls retain moisture, bounce and shine for a good 5 to 6 days."
84,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a staple hair care product for me.,I love this gel! This is by far my favorite. Has excellent hold without drying too crunchy or drying my hair out. Defines my curls and adds shine.

I have tried so many brands, I won't even name them but this is the one I recommend to anyone who asks.  I get the most compliments using this because the curl definition with this is on point."
86,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best hair gel for curly, kinky and coily hair types","This is the best hair gel that I have ever used on my natural hair.

87,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works,"It's good. Leaves the hair a bit hard/crunchy, but it holds and if I pineapple and wear a bonnet to sleep, the style will last for Days with just a light misting of the refresher spray!"

89,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Soft and curly,My best new find. I have 4c hair. This product makes my hair curl up beautifully.  Does not have any of the harsh additives like other hair products have.  Best of all it leaves my hair soft!
90,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,This magnifies my curls a lot! Unfortunately it’s greasy and it flaked but that was after a couple of uses. But if curls are what you’re looking for it does the trick.

Also, I like the way the bottle is because you can re-seal it when traveling which is nice."
93,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Weighed my hair down,I have fine wavy hair and using before diffusing made my hair less curly because it weighed it down. I would have been better off not using any gel. Last time I buy an expensive curl gel.
94,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Keeps my hair hydrated and with good curl definition,"From time to time I try another product, but I always come back to UFD Curly Magic Curl Stimulator.

97,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Curly hair,I like the cirls it gives but it is a sticky texture. I would recommend going under a heated dryer immediately after putting it on to dry the tackiness.

105,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Freakin dream come true for my natural curls,I didn’t like that the dispenser wouldn’t open up. I ordered this last month and just the other day dispenser decide to pop up on his own. Very weird other than that the product itself is amazing.

107,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, poorly packed",I really like the product. I appreciate it being inside a plastic bag for shipping because the lid was not on tight and there was a lot of product in the bag. That was disappointing because of the cost.

113,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product but it can be gotten for less,I was really excited I could get this from amazon.com. I paid too much for this item. I tried to cancel but I was too late. The product is fantastic

117,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best curl moisturizer!,Love this product for wet hair to make curls more curly when dry.
118,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,Someone recommended this product in a hair group on Facebook and I'm hooked on it.. This is my go to hair productI'd be nice if you can keep it in stock!
119,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Over Priced,"This is a quality produce, but over priced.  You can find at Walmat for $9.00."
120,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't like this product,"I didn't like this product.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle and this was cheaper by the ounce.  Unfortunately it is not as good as the Shea Moisture product on my 4C kinky coily hair. This product also doesn't mix well with leave-ins.  I liked the pump and its fine as a stand along gel for edges or to refresh an old hairstyle before brushing into a buff, but not for a wash-n-go or as a styling product for kinky coily hair.This product would probably do nicely for someone with a looser hair curl pattern.  Overall its not horrible, just didn't do what I wanted it to do.  So back to Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle I go."
121,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Stuff,I like that it adds body to my perm.

127,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, try it. It’s worth the money!",This product is like gold milk to my hair. It does exactly what it says. I’ve been definitely losing hope with finding the right products to actually help with moisture and bring back my curl patterns.
128,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Different bottle and pump doesn't work,"The hair product itself seems just fine and the same as far as I can tell. However, this new bottle is different with a pump that will not work. I even tried putting the old pump on the new bottle to find that it is an entirely different size neck. I probably will not order again if it's going to be a hassle to change containers."
129,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING PRODUCT! Don’t hesitate to buy,"I got this for my 2b-2c waves as a curl enhancer and for a refresh product. After the first use, with just some water spritzing and this product, my hair is nearly a level 3 curl! Very exciting and highly recommend."

I have to admit I use it with a few other products but even when I use it with only a leave-in conditioner on damp hair, it produces a gentle, wavy-loose coil look. My only complaint is that is is very slimy so it's hard to rub in the hands to spread onto the hair causing plops of slimy product to fall on the floor."

The only thing she complains about is that the product makes her hair crunchy, as if she had put gel in her hair."

299,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love it. The curls set and last a long ...,"I have been using Uncle Funky's Daughter for about two years.  It sat on my shelf with so many other products.  When I first tried it, I didn't follow the directions and discovered that my type 4C hair needs to be very wet.  I absolutely love it.  The curls set and last a long time.  The product also last a very long time.  The drawback, is that once the curls are set, you can not use other moisturizing products or re wet your hair because then you will have an afro rather than curls.  I now use Mizani Moisturfuse Conditioner with a heat cap for 20 minutes and Karen's body beautiful leave in for softness and moisture when I wash my hair before I use Uncle Funky's..  If I need sheen, I use Kerastase (pricy, but worth it) which also has protective qualities.  It is light, non greasy, no residue.  I also use Bed Head for shine and sealant. I can use either of these two products as often as needed."
300,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,My wife is Very Happy with product,Just what I wanted
301,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair loves this!,"Whether as a base styler under other products or as a one and done, this is one of my all time fav, holy grail products!"

303,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product,"I love this product! great slip, easy to apply and a little goes a long way. My curls are much more defined than with aphogee. The only problem is the cost! Way too expensive and even thought it works well for my hair, I will probably look for something else."
304,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use it on wet hair while you're still in the shower,Using this has really helped define my curls.
305,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,The curls are long lasting.,"Really love this product, I got the effect I was looking for and my hair feels very soft"
306,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work for me,Didn’t help my curls hold. They fell out by end of day. Tried it with gel with no luck either.

311,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,Just sits on top of your hair and creates A LOT of build up

313,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lite gel,I like this product for defining my curls with shine and light weight
314,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best curling product I've tried!,"Great product for my 4C hair!  I've tried so many curling gels/jellies/creams from many product lines trying to find what would be right for me, everything from Shea Moisture, Eco Styler, Kinky Curly, As I Am, 4 Naturals, III Sisters of Nature, Taliah Waajid...and I had the same problem over and over - flaky buildup!  No matter how much or how little I used, I'd have flakes that would end up on my shirt and very stiff, dry hair.  The only thing that seemed to work was Ms. Jessie's Curly Pudding, but that's very expensive and the curl does not last long IMO.  I LOVE Curly Magic!  I tried it based on a natural hair Youtube video (look up the Pamela Samuels Young channel).  With this product, I have NO flaking, NO dryness.  It has great hold, and the bottle lasts a very long time.  I'm so glad I came across it, I don't plan to use anything else from now on."
315,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Love it! Works great for my hair.
316,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair very soft.,"No gel cast which I liked, but not enough hold."

318,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!!!!,I absolutely love this product. My beautiful curls last for days after using it.
319,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't know your hair was naturally curly.,"I Like it a lot.  If you put too much it will make your hair stiff like hair spray, if thats what you want.  But using just the right amount  give you a natural look."
320,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Me encanta,"Super, lo maximo"
321,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough,"For me, it was too thin in consistency and didn't provide enough body as Ecogel, for example, but it may work for people with much longer hair than mine."
322,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,I really love the results.
323,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pump malfunction,Ptodu t is good. The pump mechanism does not work
324,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Goes beyond definition to give you a super curl.,"Curls for days.  More curls than I could ever imagine on my kinky 4c hair.  There's no need to reapply for the second or third day because the girls aren't going away.  If I have any complaint, it's too curly! Goes beyond definition to give you a super curl."

326,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Love this product!!!
327,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Love it
328,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the curl it gives my hair,I love the curl it gives my hair.  But it is so sticky and some days it does not dry.  I will continue to purchase it because like I like the curl it gives my hair.
329,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Three Stars,pretty good...
330,Curly Magic 32 OZ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay,"My naturally curly hair tends to like things like marshmallow root, aloe vera and more natural ingredients. This is around what my hair enjoys, but it didn't do much for me."
331,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for twist outs,"Great product to use for twist outs. It doesnt leave the hair hard and crunchy. Although it a while to dry, it keeps hair looking and feeling soft, firmly holds twist in place, and hair keeps hair hydrated without frizz."
332,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,but I'm going to add it to my list of new favorite things. The curls in my 4c hair are ...,"It is only day one of trying this gel,  but I'm going to add it to my list of new favorite things.  The curls in my 4c hair are tremendous and that doesn't happen too easily in the fall/winter months. I washed and conditioned my hair as usual.  Added my leave in and sealing products and let my hair completely dry.  The next morning I sprayed each section with water before applying the Curly Magic stimulator. The hair needs to be quite wet for the gel to work but it only takes a little.  I used a combo smoothing/finger coil technique that only takes a few minutes -then leave it be.  The curl definition really worked wonders on my hair."
333,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Natural Hair Gel...Ever!!!,I absolutely love this product. It has made all the difference in my natural hair journey. I have 4c hair and it makes my curls pop every time. I get more compliments on my hair than ever before. It’s absolutely worth every penny!!!
334,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,I love it!
335,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Great product.
336,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"Love this stuff. It's natural, light-weight, and goes a long way."
337,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of $30,"I purchased this product based on the reviews I read online.  It does NOT do what it claims.  My hair is 3c normally - this relaxed my curls instead of enhancing them, and left my hair feeling dry instead of moisturized.  Very disappointed.  Would return if my husband hadn't thrown away the box with the receipt in it but since he did I guess I'll just flush it because it's useless to me."
338,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,"It was not good for my hair, felt like a perm."
339,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,This keeps my curls popping in hot and humid climate!!!!!,This product has been heaven sent for me having moved to a tropic/humid climate. In the states I used this as a base and finished with a Devacurl or InnerSense product. Now I’m Bangkok this liquid after trial and error has alone been what are keeping my curls poppin!!!! In the shower after washing with devacurl or innersense I section clip my hair and comb the product through each section. The bottle is pretty large. Not able to find this in Asia so.......
340,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,It IS magic!!,"I've had slightly wavy frizzy hair for  most of my life. Both of my daughters have very curly hair and people were always asking where it came from. I've always dried my hair straight because whenever I would let it dry on its own to be natural, it would just be a frizzy mess within an hour of being dry.  I tried random products if they caught my eye and never really saw anything make much of a difference .One of my New Year's resolutions was to really research products that fit my hair type and see if I actually could wear my hair  with its natural wave. After reading a lot I narrowed down my curl type to 2b  And then googled products for 2b hair.  This product showed up on one review,  not hundreds, but the person's description sounded so much like my hair. I figured it was worth a shot. OMG  I actually have wavy/ curly hair!!Like a lot of people have said, the pump on my bottle did not work. Yes it has the texture of mucus,  but this product works wonders with my 2b once blonde 50 year old  hair.  I have never gotten so many compliments and people surprised to see what my hair actually looks like.  I have now bought the travel kit with five different products in it so I can test out if any others work well. I can say that this one does a great job!  My hair is fine and products tend to weigh it down but this one does not. The uncle funky's website does a very good job of saying which products go with different hair types so you can choose the products that work well for your curl pattern.  How I have been using this is getting a small amount in my hands and squishing it into my wet hair. I have also tried a light styling gel which also seems to work well with this.  My hair can even go a day or two without being washed by getting it damp and resquishing it in the morning.  Love how much this has brought out my natural hair curl pattern"
341,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Changed ingredients,"They have added glycerin, jojoba oil, and wheat protein to a product that was previously glycerin, oil, and protein free. This is not the same Curly Magic everyone knows and loves."
342,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product when used correctly .,"I really love this product so far . My hair's natural texture is very wavy with loose ringlets . It was ruined about 2 months ago by a bad haircut . After trying multiple products, curly magic has brought my hair back from the brink. This gel appears sticky coming out of the bottle but is smooth to the touch. It also does not have a strong/overpowering smell. The scent is similar to light lemongrass or ginger.  This is a tricky product to apply though. It cannot be glopped onto dry or damp hair . This gel needs to be applied to soaking wet hair and applied evenly. I rake it through my hair with my fingers, re-wet and then scrunch with a soft t-shirt . Let your hair dry without touching it and then break up any hard/stiff areas . This gel needs very little re-application for second or third day curls, just re-wet your hair and do your normal routine. It also added a nice shine."
343,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Poppin curls,I love this product.  Kept my curls poppin ALL DAY!  I also used the UFD butter cream and super curl.  Finished it off with kinky curl gel for extra hold!
344,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls That Get Attention!!!,"I have between 2c and 3a curls that frizz a lot and have no definition without some sort of gel. I ran across one person's review on some random site, and was intrigued. I bought one bottle of Curly Magic and used it right away. WOW!  My hair looked AMAZING!!! I was beside myself. I went out that night and was told by a complete stranger that I had the best curls in the whole club!! Then he corrected himself and said the whole city!  (On a high humidity night, mind you.). Next day another two different women stop to tell me they loved my curls. I'm going on my third day of beautiful hair. Thank you Uncle Funky's Daughter. I LOVE MY CURLS!"
345,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Free advice: might be cheaper if you can find it at a drug store! This stuff WORKS!,"I have been on the curly girl method for 3+ years and while I've loved the education on my curls - I was starting to get lazy and give up! The curly girl method is definitely HIGH MAINTENANCE! This working mom does not have time to wrap her head in silk every night, do weekly deep conditioning treatments, do rice water rinses and daily oil massages, etc etc.My sister told me about this and we went to Target specifically to buy this.The texture is similar to that of lube! I used it on my naked, wet curls (no leave in), wet plopped for 15 min, scrunched with a shammie for 10 min then had to air dry since I don't have 2 hours to get ready in the morning lol The wet/damp curls seemed to have a lot of definition but that's all I noticed.My air dried curls (once dried) were magnificent! Better than they have been in a while! They're even better when I blow dry them (more body).I noticed the ingredients were similar to my Bouncecurl gel and while this is not a replacement for it, it's definitely on my shelf of products I can buy at the drug store that WORK!This one is GOLD - definitely purchase it!"
346,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gentle enough even for little girl's hair!,"I love that this product is all natural! My two year old has 4b/4c hair and her curls absolutely loves this stuff! It really does bring out the natural curl pattern in her hair beautifully. Her hair is left super shiny even when it's completely dry, and it's soft to the touch. Plus, it has a really nice and clean lemony smell almost like lemon oil, but not too strong. This product only works as intended if you apply it on wet/ damp hair. It has a thick snotty consistency, so you definitely don't want to be putting it on dry hair. If you did that, you would get hard hair that has a stickiness to it. You don't want that! I would recommend using it without a leave in underneath because it might affect the results if it doesn't pair well. I use Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in conditioner sometimes and it does good, but I don't use much. I always dilute it with water and then apply the leave in. My little girl gets 2-3 day hair with this gel, but I don't mind redoing it often because her hair loves water and moisture! Whenever I need to refresh 2nd or 3rd day hair, I just lightly wet it with lukewarm water and apply a little bit more to the ends and any other sections that may need it. She shakes her head and ...Voila'! The curls separate on their own and hair is beautifully defined! I get compliments on hair hair all the time and they ask what I use. I always refer them to curly magic! Nothing has worked as good as this product so far! No build up, no crunchiness, no flaking, great natural hold, great shine, great smell, lasts a long time, and affordable! It's got my vote!"
347,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,My holy grail,"First off, I bought this at target for $15.99 for price comparison. But I am an avid amazon shopper and I tend to come here for reviews before purchasing.I LOVE this product. I have wavy (unruly) hair with occasional ringlets mixed in for fun. Without the right product, routine and prayer with every application my hair is unrestrained and willful. This product is a one stop shop for me. After all the searching and buying, layering and differing amounts...I can say that this is now my holy grail for hold, texture, humidity resistance (I live in southern Florida), and all around management.For the time being, this is the one and only product I use to style and set my hair. Absolutely worth a try. I if you purchase it from Target or Ulta, you can return it easily if it doesn't do the trick for you 👍"
348,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly girl.....3b,"Excellent product!!!  Perfect for my 3a-3b curly hair!!!  No need to use other products (i.e. gel, curl defining creme) with it."
349,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Saver!!,"I literally never leave reviews but I hope this can help another natural. My hair is like 3c/4a and colored bright red. I have been a miserable natural for 3 years because I could not perfect my wash n gos! Products that work for *everybody* (curl enhancing smoothie) did not just work for me. I found this in Target one day as I roamed the natural hair aisle and thought this just *might* work on my little stubborn curls due to it having marshmallow extract in it as my friend recommended. Sure enough, with a leave in of another brand (kinky curly) and making sure some of the Uncle Funky's was on every strand, my first successful wash n go lasted a smooth 7 days! I sprayed it with the Thirsty Curls by Uncle Funky's over that week and got tons of compliments. I finally found my lil natural stride!"
350,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, disingenuous pricing/shipping costs.","I purchased this product on Amazon last month.  It arrived within a reasonable amount of time.  I've been pleased with its results-quite pleased, in fact.  But I find the website frustrating to work through and the shipping process ridiculously disingenuous.  Having been a bit put off by the price difference on Amazon, I went to the website to order.  The prices were slightly lower---until shipping.  Not only are the shipping costs inflated, but they also increase significantly with each item.  While the items are a bit spendy, I like Uncle Funky's philosophy and could get behind paying a bit extra.  What I don't like, however, is feeling duped.  For this reason, I'm giving the hair care system a hard pass.  No thank you.  I'll stick with Shea Moisture."
351,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Long Lasting Hair Product,"Didn't get mines on Amazon. Went to a CVS store and was browsing the hair care aisle when I stumbled across this product. Brought it for $14.  I was surprised at the results. I have 4C hair and by following the instructions, I had amazing coils and curls. Didn't leave any residue or flakes after drying. Hair feels super moisturized! My only recommendation is to not get too heavy handed with the gel. A small amount goes a long way."
352,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same,"I don't think the formula was ever switched back to the original. After the original owners closed their shop and sold the entire product line, Uncle Funky's Daughter went to pits. I recommend the curl enhancer by Camille Rose."
353,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,4A/4B hair/ Don’t give up on the product,"Really a 4.5 because the product is a little tricky, and can be little sticky. But what gel isn’t. I think the stickiness gives the hold without the stiffness, like mouse but longer lasting than mouse. I have tried this product once before and did not use it correctly, so outcomes were bad. For wash and go’s (I refer to them as wash and sets), your hair has to be soak and wet, then apply the product in sections. If your hair starts drying out while you are styling, damping with water and a spray bottle. Not much product is needed. This is the only product that makes my wash and go’s last for more than a few days. Good luck!"
354,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,"I usually wear my hair straight, but I love this for when I wear it curly. My hair loves a curl stimulator, and this is the best I’ve tried. I like KCCC a lot, but it separates my curls too much. This doesn’t, and it’s more moisturizing. I think it works better on fine hair because it doesn’t work very well on my husband’s coarse hair."
355,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Defines curls beautifully!,"This product worked amazingly for my hair! The consistency is not too thick or creamy, so it doesn't weigh down my 2c-3a curls. A little on the pricey end, but it's worth it. A must-have!"
356,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk,Very very sticky and left my 4c hair dry like straw. Avoid this product!
357,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,and this never fails to define and perfect my curls like nothing else,"I keep coming back to this product.  I've tried the Shea Moisture line, Carol's Daughter, AsIAm, and this never fails to define and perfect my curls like nothing else.  I didn't use it for a week, because i misplaced it, and my hair just was not the same.  AsIAm is a very close second, but they don't have the same curl stimulator.  My hair is 3c mostly, but probably 4a/b on the sides and crown.  My curls grow in tight, perfect spirals the size of a straw.  My hair tends towards frizz, especially at the root and tip.  I've only been one year natural, so I am still learning what my hair responds to best, but UFD Curl Stimulator is one that I do not plan to be without!!"
358,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,No Glycerin but Lots of Aloe. Love it as refresh too,"I was looking for something glycerin free and grabbed this at Target for $15.99 for a 12 oz. I couldn’t wait to try, so actually used as a refresher to test it out and it did the trick. Wash day even better and works well alone too. Aloe is number 2 ingredient and if your hair doesn’t like it, be wary."
359,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,May have to give up my Eco,"I have 4c hair and I must admit that I am a big eco styler gel to have some curls..This is a great product and it’s true what other say, you don’t need a lot. I am a big fan of eco styler...have tubs of it...I may have to give it up because this is WAY better! It leaves my hair soft and the curls pop!!"
360,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what it used to be!  Read this review!!,"At one time I would strongly recommend Curly Magic.  It was a product that gave your natural wave/curl pattern a magnificent enhancement.  Then they changed the formula.  The new formula made my hair extremely dry.  I contacted the company and was told that they were going back to the old formula.  Mind you, customer service is not good.  Since it was past the return date, I could not return it to the store where purchased.  They said that I could return it to them and they would send me a new bottle.  Of course, they asked how much was in my bottle.  I had bought it, but not used it until my other bottle had been depleted.  It was a brand new bottle!  Needless to say, I did not return it to them.  However, I returned to the store and purchased another bottle which said nothing about a new formula.  I though I was safe.  However, it is not the ORIGINAL formula.  So needless to say, I have two worthless bottles of product at a cost of $30 each. I'm disappointed because once you finally find a good product for your hair, you want to be able to continue to use it and stop the search.  The search is on again."
361,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,I found 1 bottle of this at a store and grabbed it. I don’t even know what I paid for it. It’s so nice. Not hard and crunchy but holds curls well. My hair looked great once dried. I’m going to try the other products in this line.
362,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally Found It,Im in love. It came in the mail today and I just used it and my curls are on fleeeek! I have 4a hair and its beautiful!
363,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for my 3B hair.,Absolutely LOVE this product!!! It’s lightweight and not heavy on my hair.
364,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love It!,"My daughter has been using the gel for a long time. I was loyal to another brand but finally tried it and the results were amazing! My curls are silky, lightweight with a great shine! Love my natural hair and this product does too!!Now please create something to cover this grey! 🙂 #FIFTYandFAB"
365,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome, awesome product","I have never bought this product on Amazon, but have used it for several years, always buying directly from the Uncle Funky's Daughters website..  I have tried so many other curly products in the past, but NONE have come close to Curly Magic, not even the Deva Curl products. I am a white woman with 3b hair, fine in texture, but thick in volume. It does make the air drying time longer  than usual, but the end results is so worth waiting the long dry time. My curls last for at least 5-6 days in great shape with minimal frizz. I get many compliments on my hair and questions about what products do I use. I am always  happy to recommend Curly Magic, this is the only curly gel that I will use.  Some reviewers commented on the new formula. I really didn't see any difference between the old and the new in my hair, but I guess that's a very individual thing depending on your hair type.  I love this product and will use no other !!"
366,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would recommend,"This stuff is great! I just started using it to try and help figure out my waves and it’s been so nice. Smells good, easy to use, affordable and does what it’s supposed to. I will def buy it again."
367,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"Just a little sticky however, love this product.  Gives my hair great slip, shine and reduces breakage..."
368,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works on fine curly hair,"I love love this product! It gives me the shine, pretty definition while controlling the frizz! My hair actually moves & it feels light & airy!I have a lot of fine curly hair"
369,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,"Curly Magic is wonderful.But make sure you read the instructions carefully!Only a small ammount is needed after you wash your hair. This is not the kind of hair gel you can use daily. It's way too thick!A little goes a long way. Side note, you can get it cheaper($25.00) directly from Uncle Funky's website. Anything over that is a rip!"
370,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I Use this Daily on My Short, Dry, Curly Hair","I am very pleased and will purchase this again!PROS: I'm an African-American woman with natural hair. My hair is very short and curly and tends to be very dry and brittle if I don't moisturize. I've tried other moisturizing, curl defining products, but this one, recommended by my hairdresser and stylist, is definitely the best I've ever used. It moisturizes and does a nice job with curl definition. I use a quarter-sized amount, and that is more than enough.CONS: Unfortunately, this product is heavy, so it leaves my hair feeling a little sticky. I wash my hair twice per week with a gentle clarifying shampoo to remove the sticky, icky feel."
371,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for dry wavy hair,"Love it! I have dry wavy 2B/C hair that gets easily weighed down or frizzy and puffy. I have trouble finding a product that gives enough moisture without going overboard. I also need product that gives definition because wavy hair can easily get too wild. Curly Magic is perfect for dry wavy hair because it moisturizing but doesn't weigh down hair, and it defines waves and curls without the crunch or tackiness of gel. Will repurchase!"
372,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mess,"This stuff, is the worst hair product, leaves a residue, so sticky, hv to wash hair every other day"
373,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with results,"I really like this product. I have used Loma curl cream and AG Recoil (which I love), but wanted to try this and am happy with it. Super easy to pump into hand and scrunch into my hair. It has a good smell also. Not sure if I’d purchase again but I am glad I tried it."
374,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!!,"I have a mix of 4a,4b and 4c hair and this product really defines my curls! I absolutely love this gel!  I will be trying more of their products!"
375,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT...but...,"This curl is Phenomenal,  but the stickiness,  if you use too much is also phenomenal, but not in a good way.."
376,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,All day moisture~ no residue ~ a little goes a long way!,"The price was a little intimidating at first, but all the great reviews from friends made me want to buy it anyway. Wow!  It has a pleasant, clean smell and a little goes a long way.  I put a small amount on and it stayed moisturized throughput the day, never once did it get crunchy or leave a residue!  So worth it!"
377,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,The curl definition is REAL!!!,"Had been looking for something to create more definition. I was on you tube and saw a review done on this product and her hair was amazing. My daughter said she also heard the product was good. And it have DEFINITELY amazing!! Curls are defined, shiny,  stretched and its even held moisture better! The hype is real! Try it!"
378,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pump didn’t work,For a hair product that was so expensive the pump didn’t work. I never got to try it. It went back.
379,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading,"This product does not define curls, I would say if you have fine or beautiful natural curly hair it probably will define.  My hair is back to natural curl after not having a perm in over thirty years but it didn’t do anything for my hair especially after it dries,"
380,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry hair,I love it for my dry hair but beware its not very lightweight but it still let my curl pretty normal I have fine hair for reference
381,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hair product,Really good product at a reasonable price.  I’m looking forward to trying more of this line.
382,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,This works well with my natural curls.,I really like that it made my hair curl but didn't leave my hair greasy or stiff.
383,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff,Not crunchy. Soft curl definining
384,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,Making my hair stronger. Thanks!

386,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff!!!,"Its really slippery and moisturizing. I have type 4 hair and i find that this product is a nice addition to a wash n go, or a twist/braid out! You will probably need another gel for extra shine though, even though its not ashy!"
387,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"It got to my house really fast, in hood conditions, I love how it feels in my hair, leaves my hair moisture and soft. Love it, I recommend it 100% I’ll order more in the future."
388,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair will stay funky!!! Love Uncle Funky’s Curl Magic!,Super moisturizing! Great curl lock! Not overpriced like other products!
389,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but worth it,Love the light weight feel and smell and it keeps curls well

398,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,The slip with this product is amazing!!!,This product is WONDERFUL!!!
399,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously most consistent, best results!","This stuff is magical! I’ve tried several gels and mousses and this by far gives me the best results every time and lasts the longest. And it doesn’t make my hair feel dry or product-y at all! And I barely do a refresh with just my fingers and a little water and it still looks great after 3 days! I love that it reactivates with water so I don’t have to put more product in my hair and it makes my refreshes so simple and easy! I’ve never found another product that does so well in my hair! Never change Uncle Funky! For reference, I have 2cish wavy/curly hair that is very fine and low-density and this doesn’t weigh my hair down at all. Couldn’t be happier!"
400,Curly Magic 32 OZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice smell,Nice smell and works good with my curly hair.
401,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Product for those curls!,I have finally found a curly hair product I love! Gives your curls volume and shine and at the same time it holds those gorgeous curls!
402,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works beautifully on my hair!,"Love, love love the product.  Just wish it had a tad more hold. It's my wash day staple!"
403,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really is magic!,"I have never loved my hair as much as I do now. I am a 4c girl, and I thought I needed ecostyler to get my curls to pop. Turns out, the reason my curls were so unpredictable and unruly, was because of product buildup. I tried the oil free detox, started using shampoo every week,  ditched oils and butters. Now I just use curly magic, and my wash and go is on point and stays that way all week. If I need to refresh it a little, I just spray a little water in sections and rake my fingers through it, the curly magic is reactivated like on wash day. It rinses clean on wash day with no build up. It doesn't leave your hair hard. It is soft and shiny. I love this stuff."
404,Curly Magic 32 OZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Came broken.  Poor packaging.  Might reorder,
405,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,This gives awesome curl definition I found go to that does what it claims,"I love the curl definition on my coily hair that squats down when it’s wet, allow it to dry W/o disturbing . Your curls are going to pop also and that not a good pic of the results. If I say more your going ti have to pay me or give a free bottle hint hint lol"
406,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,pump dont work,Was excited to try this product - two stars given because pump won't pop open. I must have gotten a defective one.  Have to unscrew to get product out for my hair.  Not happy about this esp for the price I paid.
407,Curly Magic 32 OZ,2.0 out of 5 stars,Was not happy with this product.  I wanted something like Curls up by FX and this did not come close,Just was not what I expected.  Did not keep curls in like I thought it would
408,Curly Magic 32 OZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy with this!,I seen a TikTok video of another lady with curly hair using this so I ordered it. I’m so glad I did! My curl pattern is stunning!!! I put it in my hair when my hair is soaked still in the shower! I plop with a t-shirt and go about my business. I let my hair air dry them I scrunch the crunch out and it’s beautiful! No residue ever! I will be using this product as long as it’s available! Highly recommend!
