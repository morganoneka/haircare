0,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",1.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t think this is legit.,"I LOVE this conditioner, it’s so good for my curly hair and works very well, that said what I received from my amazon subscribe and save order is NOT the conditioner I’ve been using.  This is the second bottle I’ve ordered, I noticed a difference in consistency when I gave my daughter the first bottle, but assumed they maybe changed the formula. I think this is counterfeit now with the second bottle after comparing, which  is disappointing, because a major factor in buying Pacifica products is that they are vegan and cruelty free, and with a counterfeit item you can pretty much guarantee that’s not the case.The left side of each photo is the bottle I just finished off, the right side is what was received from amazon.A) the bottles are very different, the amazon one looks and feels cheaply made, different graphic qualities too. Size is all wrong.B) the scent is not as strong and more vanilla with the amazon product, the product I normally buy has a strong fruity/pineapple scent.C) the consistency is SOOO different. The one I normally buy is thick and creamy, goes a long way. The one from amazon is thin like cheap conditioner."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Harsh conditioner negates the gentle shampoo,"(Reviewed as a set.) I love pineapple and wanted to love this product so much, I bought the set.  I have long, thick, curly, indigenous hair that tends to frizz; I'm also sensitive to scents, and lean toward natural products. SHAMPOO: Has a light, sweet, real-fruit smell that wants more depth, more power. It does not smell pina colada-y but I think I do get a whiff of banana (not my favorite). I imagine that scent is hard to balance in hair products; overall I like it. The lather is super thick with a nice, clean silky rinse and leaves my wet hair feeling clean and soft instead of stripped, with truly defined spiral curls. I can't detect any pineapple scent in my hair after rinsing. Feels nice, a good shampoo that is gentle enough to use often. However, I prefer washing 1x/week, so that's a little too gentle for me. But I liked it and was excited to try a conditioner that would amplify and continue that sweet, soft, curly feeling. It disappointed. CONDITIONER: Same scent, no issues. Feels light but strange and slick going on, and is actually too light/thin for thick hair. I had to use a lot of it, more than other conditioners, and had to press it into my hair to absorb-- it felt like a rebellious conditioner that didn't want to perform. It left the exact opposite feeling from the shampoo: greasy residue, not natural, ill-formulated, and drying. It clings to my hair, not in the way you want, so I had to rinse and rinse and rinse, negating the initial good shampoo. Pacifica products are not cheap in price, but are becoming more cheap in feel. My search for curly-hair cleansing products continues...."
2,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an average conditioner. The best feature is that it smells delicious. It's a thin conditioner and I can barely believe that it's intended for textured hair since it provides almost no moisture. This is best for straight, low porosity hair. It does nothing for my medium porosity, frizz prone wavy-curly hair. Maui Moisture has so many better options for a drug store brand. I also like the Garnier conditioners in the jars. They are silicone free as well!"
3,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",1.0 out of 5 stars,Curl relaxer not enhancer or definer,I have thick wavy with loose curls hair.  This product flattened my hair and made it feel dirty (felt oily with built up residue)  This may be a good product for people with tight curls that want to relax them.
4,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Curly Hair,"In the past couple months I have learned the Curly Girl Method and I have been experimenting with some shampoos and conditioners. I really REALLY like this one a lot. It has a fruity smell that is a bit strong but not so strong to deter me (That is actually what worried me the most because I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to strong smells, and especially the ""exotic"" pineapple, banana, and such smells really make me keel over in the mornings). Initially, out of the bottle it is a bit strong but after washing it really isn't that strong, the smell of my shampoo is actually stronger. Anyways, sometimes I don't put in argon oil after showering to help keep my curls and I notice that with this conditioner, without the oil, it still helps keeps my curls nice. They are softer and a little looser without the oil or styler but it works great and I have been getting lots of compliments!"
5,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for fine hair - a dupe for wavemaker.,"I was really hesitant to try this but I'm so glad I did. I have fine 2b high porosity hair (the kind that gets super frizzy in a little bit of humidity). I've used a tonne of products and this is def one of my all time favourites. It's alot like wavemaker and cantu - and I only use a peasized amount of it. Gives some volume (but doesn't make your hair feel weighed down or full of product). I don't really need to layer products with this but if I really want to, I add a spritz of the b&b invisible oil primer or homemade salt spray!"
6,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly light and long-lasting,"Love this stuff. It smells light and natural. I use a small pea sized amount for my shoulder length hair if I am pulling it back, and about twice that much if I am wearing it down. It defines the curls and keeps the frizzies down. It doesn't coat my hands, washes off easily, and doesn't weigh my hair down with heavy/waxy stuff like some products do. This small tube lasts a long time, too."
7,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls POP and BOUNCE,"For my whole life I needed two bottles of conditioner per one bottle of shampoo...and that was just for the stuff I wasn't using for co-washing.  For the last 10 years or so I've been using DevaCurl, and I've rarely tried anything else.  I've been using 10-14 pumps of conditoner every day. I really overdid it the first time I tried Pineapple Curls and I was am still stunned that a small palmful coats and detangles all my hair! It's like I can't use a small enough amount!  I was worried that a 10 oz. tube would last me a week, but this conditioner is so concentrated, my daughter and I are both using it and it's lasting for weeks! This is my new favorite conditioner.  This does not weight my hair down in the least - instead it makes my curls spring and bounce.  I have 2c-3b (mostly 3a) low porosity, coarse curls. I wish I'd found this conditioner a long time ago! I am crazy about the smell...like vacation on Maui!"
8,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,great product,I have2c-3b curls and fine hair. Works great without weighing down-you dont need much
9,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff. Bigger bottle please,Hi I have 3c curly hair and its bleach blonde and I been looking for something to replace my Cantu curl cream activator that I love but it's getting harder to find so I tried this curl defining cream and I really like it. My curls are shiny and  bouncy I do use a gel after nut I like it alot. I will say my only complaint is for 13 bucks I wish the bottle was bigger.
10,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wave Killer,"This conditioner killed my waves completely. I've been using curly girl approved products and building up my waves for about a year now and after one use of this conditioner my hair was straighter than before I started. I tried clarifying my hair and giving it another shot, but got the same results.The consistency of this product does seem strange, as other reviews stated. It's VERY watery, but I've never used it before so it's possible that this is normal and not the result of tampering.All in all, it makes my hair very soft and smooth, but I wouldn't recommend for wavy hair."
11,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved this until..,"So I have been having issues with allergies. My old cowash and conditioner started making me break out in hives (yikes) so I switched to a new cowash and this conditioner. I personally love this brand and had never used their hair products.The conditioner, while called pineapple, to me smells just like banana runts. I really loved it. Made my hair soft and made the wave and curl in my hair pop.Unfortunately, I started to have issues where everytime I used it, it made my head itch terribly. When I compared it to the other stuff I had issues with, I found an ingredient that they shared. So when looking for something new, I spent a lot of time to find something without that ingredient.Do highly recommend it though! Wish I could still use it."
12,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",1.0 out of 5 stars,Counterfeit or Watered Down...,I love this product but it is definitely not the same product I've used in the past. It is much more watery - not the nice thick cream it normally is. I also noticed there was an ingredient sticker placed over the ingredients on the bottle. I checked the reviews to see if others had noticed anything different and sure enough some had and at least one person also had the sticker over the ingredients. I requested a refund and I am going to buy this one in store from now on. What a bummer because subscribe-and-save is so convenient.
13,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not even close to the Deva Curl Wavemaker,"If I use it with just mousse it does not moisture my hair enough, it actually leaves it quite dry and frizzy. I really wanted to like it because the packaging is so cute and many said the smell was great. To me the scent is nice but not as strong as say Cantu. I am using it mixed with Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus smoothie because that was too moisturizing lol so mixed together they work great. I am still searching for a replacement for the Devs Curl wavaker. This ain't it. For reference, I have thin, low density, medium porosity, 2C-3A hair."
14,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to manage hair & great scent,"This smells so good, I used too much the first time, just to inhale the tropical scent. My curls dragged down, so the next time I used less & my curls were bouncier. An unexpected benefit is that my thick hair wets down more easier for shampooing when I use this curl cream. I have thick hair & we have a lot of minerals in our water."
15,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product for my curls,"When my hairstylist told me that I should go with my natural curls, I tried so many different products but nothing seemed to work right. I am a natural blonde with thick curly short hair. This product is awesome. I wet my hair a little bit with Pacifica hair and body spray or water and then use the cream to crunch in my curls. Looks awesome every time."
16,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very different products,"Shampoo:-Nice light scent, pleasant and not overly sweet-Foamy and cleansing, while still being gentle-Hair feels super soft, even after rinsing-12oz bottle, nice designConditioner:-Same scent, maybe a bit muted-Wayyy to thin, it doesn't truly condition-Ruins the soft feeling from the shampoo-8oz bottle, and much more is needed than the shampoo. It'll run out way before the shampoo with the amount needed for it to somewhat work as conditioner. Even then, I don't think it's worth even using it.Conclusion:I absolutely recommend the shampoo, and I'll continue to use it. The conditioner may wind up in the trash. :("
17,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good conditioner,"I have been CGM for 18 months. I have read multiple positive reviews about this product so I decided to try it.Now what I have learned in this journey is that your curls are not the same as mine so let me tell you about my curls. I have pretty tight curls. My hair is THIIIRRRRSSSTTTY so it desires moisture and my hair is average (not too thick or too thin)With this description, I’d like to tell you that my hair loved this product. It smells delicious, it works fabulous as a leave in but it is a tad runny so I used a lot. I think I used it 4 times and it’s gone. I’m going to buy it again because it made my hair bouncy, light and it looked moisturized."
18,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",1.0 out of 5 stars,Too thin...seems like a watered down return,"I've bought this conditioner before and loved it.  I bought it again and now it is very thin and even a bit foamy and it's like I didn't use conditioner at all.  I suspect this was a return that someone added water or something to.  To test that theory, I attempted a return and lo and behold they do allow returns.  I'm just throwing it....obviously Amazon is selling USED toiletries as NEW."
19,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Killed my waves,"Naturally my hair does a beach wave. I’ve been working to encourage and develop it. I took a shot on this set, and wish I hadn’t. It made my hair so silky, that it doesn’t hold any texture at all. The pictures are my hair after the first wash with this set vs. it’s natural air dried wave. I don’t know how they market this as a product to help waves and curls. I’m just going to use it on my little girls straight hair and go back to Shea Moisture."
20,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight,Great product for wavy hair. I layer this with a gel on soaking wet hair and it really helps define and clump. I would say it definitely needs a gel or a mousse because it has little to no hold. Has a faint coconut scent to me I don’t get pineapple at all
21,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not greasy, leaves hair feeling soft <3",Easily one of the best products I've ever used (33y). I've spent a lot of my life looking for a product that wouldn't leave my hair hard as wax or greasy. I think I've finally found a product to stick with. I just hope irony doesn't rear its ugly head and then the place goes out of business leaving me searching for another 20 years.
22,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hydration,"It provides a great hydration to my hair. I have 2c/3b hair texture w some loose curls here & there, Since I live in a hot humid area I’m always struggling w frizz & lack of definition. When using this mask I notice my hair seems more juicy & defined, & it smells great. Doesn’t feel heavy but it’s not light either(does that make sense?) but it provides enough moisture. I do find I need to use conditioner to be able to distribute it though out, as soon as it’s on, it feels very rich. works great so far. I would deff recommend to somebody who needs a little hydration boost."
23,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm obsessed...,"I accidentally ordered 2 of these instead of 1, but I'm in love with this conditioner so I'm happy for the spare!! It smells so good, like a yummy tropical vacation. I like the ingredients, I like that it doesn't have silicones. The best part of this conditioner is how lightweight it is, yet it actually detangles my hair. I have naturally wavy and very tangly hair and I always comb through it after putting conditioner in. This passes the comb-through test. A lot of other conditioners are just heavy, but don't actually detangle. This one detangles, makes my hair super soft and shiny after rinsing, enhances my natural wavy texture, and smells amazing. I will definitely be ordering more!!!!!"
24,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,My hair surprisingly loves this product,"I have 3c hair (confused on my exact porosity) and this is the only product I have been happy with after experimenting with other leave ins and oils for about a year. My hair loves moisture and it was difficult to find a leave in that wouldn't dry so quickly. What i really liked about this leave in was that I only needed water to refresh my curls after a while. Usually I have to redo my curls all together (re add random leave in, add water, try not to cry and get frustrated lol)  throughout the day and other products tend to make my hair stiff and dry so I try to find moisture combinations that work. I wasn't afraid to use this everyday and that says a lot.  I also noticed less shedding with this cream. I thought it was because I was taking better care of my hair in general, but when I ran out of Pacifica and started using not so good cheap products, my hair started to shed a lot again. This is the only product I feel like my hair is safe with for now! I literally just ordered my second bottle and the new curl pomade. My hair can't deal with the mess of gels and oils and random leave ins any longer. My only complaints are that I wish the bottle was bigger and the smell lasted longer. I think less is more because I have to make sure I spread the cream throughout my hair and use a little more water and oil combinations and then my hair is nice and soft and surprisingly bouncy. If your hair has a love-hate relationship with protein, then use less and make sure it's spread out evenly! (It contains coconut oil) It's meant to be a lightweight product, I just got carried away because I literally love this product lol. My hair is strange to me. As someone with fine curly wavyish strands but high volume ""ethnic"" hair, the right amount goes a long way.  I used way more than other reviews said because my hair loves the moisture. I was low-key surprised this worked on my hair type lol. It made my hair routine more enjoyable. Instead of redoing my hair when I want to refresh my curls now all I do is add water and maybe an oil to seal but this cream contains oil and leaves my scalp soft and massageable lol. I'm so wary of products that claim to be vegan and silicone free but this formula is what I needed so far."
25,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my dry curls,"I have super dry, curly, fine hair. I've basically been searching for balanced products my entire life. I had purchased Pacifica's lilac lotion, and knew their quality, so I took a gamble on the conditioner. Although pineapple is my favorite fruit, I must say this smells a little too sickly sweet for me (like right before a pineapple is about to go). That aside, OH MY GOD, it's the creamiest, non-greasy, buttery conditioner I have ever used! I LOVE how my curls feel and look, and the great news is that the scent mostly disappears after you rinse it out. Once my hair is dry I hardly notice the pineapple at all. I paid less than $5 here for my 8 oz. tube, and feel like I got a great bargain. The curls are shiny, bouncy, and my hair is SO soft. It's a winner!"
26,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Watery and not great quality - my heart is broken,"I bought this before and liked it before I learned about hair types and what good conditioners are supposed to feel like. Recently purchased again and was sad to find how terrible this product actually is.It’s very watery, which means you’ll go through the bottle quickly. Even with more product, it never actually seems to coat the hair, and does virtually nothing to detangle or give your hair any softness or silkiness.The scent is quite  strong for being one of the last ingredients. It’s a mix of pineapple and coconut, so if you’re looking to smell like an island (or a cocktail), look no further!But sadly, I’ve found better cheaper conditioners with more for my money at any drugstore.No hard feelings, Pineapple Curls. I really wanted to love you."
27,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing but not a thick conditioner,"My hair is low porosity, 3b, medium density, caucasian. My hair is weighed down easily so I like this light conditioner... it allows me to be more heavy handed with styling products, which I like. The consistency of this conditioner is rather thin and it takes a lot of product to feel like my hair is coated. And I have short hair. I like hyaluronic acid for my skin and hair, and I appreciate the curl-friendly, cruelty free ingredients. Beforehand I use a cowash or shampoo. After I rinse out the Pineapple Curls I put in leave-in conditioner. If your hair is thick or coarse in any way, you won't be satisfied with this. I can't image a lot of curly girls loving this, but if you have waves or loose curls this would be great for you."
28,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Defining Shampoo + Pineapple Curls Defining Conditioner | Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff,I have a head full of natural curly hair and for years I've been using wen. I was afraid to even you something else because my hair is so thick and coarse and I didn't think anything else would work boy was I wrong I also used to shampoo with it I'm serious when I say I didn't have high hopes but I was willing to give it a try because I'm all about not hurting a bunny to clean my hair the stuff is vegan and cruelty-free I hope that matters to you all

What I received is not the same as what I've been using.  The bottle didn't ""feel"" right, the colors/design/size of the bottle was off, there was no foil safety seal on the tube opening, the scent of the product wasn't anything fruity as you would expect from something with pineapple in the name ... I don't think that this is legit Pacifica product.  Returned immediately."

It smells great just like pineapple and the scent seems to last a long time however, it feels like it dries my curls out. Being a natural product this isn’t what I expected at all and I was highly disappointed. Go with something that’ll help your curls not damage them, would highly not recommend."

The scent is 10/10 and just lightly lingers for 3ish days after wash. This doesn't FEEL lightweight when using because it has oils in it and an amazing slip for detangling. However, my hair doesn't seem like it's weighed out at all."

Smooth, Bouncy, Perfect Curls","I really didn't know it was possible for a curl product to work this well.

This product has an amazing smell to it. However, it didn't work for my hair at all. This product dried out my hair, and left my hair looking super greasy even after it was freshly washed. The first few tries, I thought this effect was from using too much product. However, I still had this issue even when using a very small amount of product. I would not reccomend this product."

I have wavy, voluminous hair that easily turns into a hot frizzy mess.

After using the matching shampoo without issue, I applied this conditioner and the nightmare began. As soon as I squeezed the product through my tresses, I realized that there was a huge problem. My hair was no longer tangle-free. In fact I couldn't run my fingers through it at all. The hair was instantly deeply matted. It took 10 hours (over the span of 3 days....thank you God for the miracle of telecommuting....) to work out the tangled mess, cutting quite a bit along the way. And after all of that, I still couldn't free the last 15% and had to cut it down.I almost never leave reviews, but I had to try to help even 1 fellow Curly. IF YOU HAVE TYPE 4 COILS, THIS IS NOT YOUR PRODUCT!!! The attached picture is about 25% of what I lost (Bottle cap for scale).Curlfriend, just don't do it."

My hair is healthy chest level length and colored bright red. I have a mix of small banana curls, waves, stretched out curls and a few straight pieces mixed in. with NY weather any day could be an unruly or a frizz day. And I hate gel and hair spray. I keep things natural. Icurrently use the sea salt wave cream and I love it but I wanted just a touch more of a “molded hold”.  It keeps my hair soft bouncy and I truly look like so just left the beach. This pineapple cream great and is a little thicker and has a Nice hold to it which does make Are my hair a little crunchy.  I mix the two and its perfect. Just what I want a nice full fluff with a touch of hold that isn’t sticky or stiff and they both smell delicious. I Will be buying stock in them both before they discontinue any thing."

Most curl creams I’ve tried either weighed my hair down or made my ends look dry. I have very sensitive skin so I am picky what goes on my hair. I used about a tablespoon of this with a denman brush and got the softest, shiniest, thickest wave/curl clumps I’ve ever had. I went out in 110* heat a few hours later and minimal frizz. I am very  happy and will definitely be using this every wash day. I wish they had a pineapple gel."

However, the the containers are NOT sealed. Why make such a nice product and not put a simple piece of foil or plastic? The lid came off during shipping from Amazon in their usual thin plastic one-day mailers and it spilled out all over three other items that I purchased. Please make products with a seal. That way people know that they’re getting the product that is supposed to be in the container, as packed from the manufacturer, and it’s more hygienic feeling to open a sealed product, and it doesn’t spill out all over everything resulting in product loss when shipped. Kudos to great products—Keep making wonderful products! I love all of the unique options, scents, and safer ingredients. Packaging is beautiful."

When my hair was still damp after my shower, I put this cream in and scrunched a bit. then I twisted it on top of my head and slept on it. When I woke up the next morning my hair was barely damp, but so soft and curly. I brushed through my hair with my fingers, scrunched a bit and went out the door (after coffee of course) I have gotten so many comments at work. The scent does fade, you won't smell like pineapple all day. The scent is actually up in the air. When the package first came I had everyone in my family smell. I smelled pineapple and so did one of my sons, My other son smelled coconut, as did my fiance. My daughter shrugged and said it smelled like pina colada. No regrets on this purchase though!"

It doesn’t dry out my hair. However, the conditioner is so watered down that my poor curls were so damaged from using it. I also have the leave in conditioner, but it does no justice for me either.

1,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Enhancing Natural Shampoo, For Curly, Coily, & Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Hyaluronic Acid + Argan Oil, Silicone Free, Vegan + Cruelty Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,All around good product,I initially thought I would not like this shampoo based off the smell. But once your hair is dry it just smells clean not like pina colada at all. My curls have never looked better and it doesn't make my hair greasy like a lot of shampoos do.

This shampoo in the five times I have used it, has turned my hair into straw. I even went with the positive reviews on this, thinking I would also have a good review. Unfortunately, I don’t. I guess it depends on the individual, but for me this is not a worthy product."

The smell is very fake pineapple and didn't really suit my taste, and I didn't feel like it enhanced my curls at all. I also felt that after a day, my hair didn't smell or feel very clean and I had to shower again. Was hoping for a better result after using for at least a few weeks straight; will not be purchasing again."

11,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Enhancing Natural Shampoo, For Curly, Coily, & Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Hyaluronic Acid + Argan Oil, Silicone Free, Vegan + Cruelty Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Acts like a shampoo with SLS :(,"This shampoo is great if you have oily hair, or excessive buidup, unfortunately it dried out my porous and thin 3C hair. I don’t think it is a very balanced formula and whirl there are no sulfates there is a very drying ingredient in here that actually left my hair feeling damaged. It lathers very well and would probably work better with thicker hair that isn’t prone to drying out."

I loved the products. From the shampoo, conditioner and leave in but they have changed the formula recently. The shampoo now strips hair of any natural oils. The condition seems to be watered down and no longer conditions at all. The leave in may still be a good product but by the time I'm done with the cleaning process,  my hair is left so fried that no product will bring down the frizz! Now I am left with very brittle hair that breaks and falls out! 😢 It's so freaking thin right now!"

It magically gave me my natural curls back - I hadn’t seen them in years! Smells great and works with a small amount.  Buy the set - shampoo, conditioner, styling cream.  I immediately stocked up, this stuff is so good.  I air dry, no diffuser needed.  Just scrunch up your damp hair and watch it dry into soft ringlets. I had given up on styling my hair curly with my natural curls. I tried multiple products over the years unsuccessfully.  My curls were always frizzy and unruly. I’ll say it again - THIS PRODUCT WORKS AMAZING!!!"

For reference, I have thick, frizzy, curly hair. After using this shampoo and rinsing with water, my hair clumped together like all the moisture had been sucked out of it. Not even cheap drug store shampoos do that to my hair. It was terrible. I had to use tons of conditioner (way more than normal) just to try to get my hair to feel like it usually does. I need a product that ADDS moisture, not removes it."

0,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",1.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t think this is legit.,"I LOVE this conditioner, it’s so good for my curly hair and works very well, that said what I received from my amazon subscribe and save order is NOT the conditioner I’ve been using.  This is the second bottle I’ve ordered, I noticed a difference in consistency when I gave my daughter the first bottle, but assumed they maybe changed the formula. I think this is counterfeit now with the second bottle after comparing, which  is disappointing, because a major factor in buying Pacifica products is that they are vegan and cruelty free, and with a counterfeit item you can pretty much guarantee that’s not the case.The left side of each photo is the bottle I just finished off, the right side is what was received from amazon.A) the bottles are very different, the amazon one looks and feels cheaply made, different graphic qualities too. Size is all wrong.B) the scent is not as strong and more vanilla with the amazon product, the product I normally buy has a strong fruity/pineapple scent.C) the consistency is SOOO different. The one I normally buy is thick and creamy, goes a long way. The one from amazon is thin like cheap conditioner."
1,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Harsh conditioner negates the gentle shampoo,"(Reviewed as a set.) I love pineapple and wanted to love this product so much, I bought the set.  I have long, thick, curly, indigenous hair that tends to frizz; I'm also sensitive to scents, and lean toward natural products. SHAMPOO: Has a light, sweet, real-fruit smell that wants more depth, more power. It does not smell pina colada-y but I think I do get a whiff of banana (not my favorite). I imagine that scent is hard to balance in hair products; overall I like it. The lather is super thick with a nice, clean silky rinse and leaves my wet hair feeling clean and soft instead of stripped, with truly defined spiral curls. I can't detect any pineapple scent in my hair after rinsing. Feels nice, a good shampoo that is gentle enough to use often. However, I prefer washing 1x/week, so that's a little too gentle for me. But I liked it and was excited to try a conditioner that would amplify and continue that sweet, soft, curly feeling. It disappointed. CONDITIONER: Same scent, no issues. Feels light but strange and slick going on, and is actually too light/thin for thick hair. I had to use a lot of it, more than other conditioners, and had to press it into my hair to absorb-- it felt like a rebellious conditioner that didn't want to perform. It left the exact opposite feeling from the shampoo: greasy residue, not natural, ill-formulated, and drying. It clings to my hair, not in the way you want, so I had to rinse and rinse and rinse, negating the initial good shampoo. Pacifica products are not cheap in price, but are becoming more cheap in feel. My search for curly-hair cleansing products continues...."

The best feature is that it smells delicious. It's a thin conditioner and I can barely believe that it's intended for textured hair since it provides almost no moisture. This is best for straight, low porosity hair. It does nothing for my medium porosity, frizz prone wavy-curly hair. Maui Moisture has so many better options for a drug store brand. I also like the Garnier conditioners in the jars. They are silicone free as well!"

4,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Curly Hair,"In the past couple months I have learned the Curly Girl Method and I have been experimenting with some shampoos and conditioners. I really REALLY like this one a lot. It has a fruity smell that is a bit strong but not so strong to deter me (That is actually what worried me the most because I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to strong smells, and especially the ""exotic"" pineapple, banana, and such smells really make me keel over in the mornings). Initially, out of the bottle it is a bit strong but after washing it really isn't that strong, the smell of my shampoo is actually stronger. Anyways, sometimes I don't put in argon oil after showering to help keep my curls and I notice that with this conditioner, without the oil, it still helps keeps my curls nice. They are softer and a little looser without the oil or styler but it works great and I have been getting lots of compliments!"
5,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for fine hair - a dupe for wavemaker.,"I was really hesitant to try this but I'm so glad I did. I have fine 2b high porosity hair (the kind that gets super frizzy in a little bit of humidity). I've used a tonne of products and this is def one of my all time favourites. It's alot like wavemaker and cantu - and I only use a peasized amount of it. Gives some volume (but doesn't make your hair feel weighed down or full of product). I don't really need to layer products with this but if I really want to, I add a spritz of the b&b invisible oil primer or homemade salt spray!"
6,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly light and long-lasting,"Love this stuff. It smells light and natural. I use a small pea sized amount for my shoulder length hair if I am pulling it back, and about twice that much if I am wearing it down. It defines the curls and keeps the frizzies down. It doesn't coat my hands, washes off easily, and doesn't weigh my hair down with heavy/waxy stuff like some products do. This small tube lasts a long time, too."
7,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls POP and BOUNCE,"For my whole life I needed two bottles of conditioner per one bottle of shampoo...and that was just for the stuff I wasn't using for co-washing.  For the last 10 years or so I've been using DevaCurl, and I've rarely tried anything else.  I've been using 10-14 pumps of conditoner every day. I really overdid it the first time I tried Pineapple Curls and I was am still stunned that a small palmful coats and detangles all my hair! It's like I can't use a small enough amount!  I was worried that a 10 oz. tube would last me a week, but this conditioner is so concentrated, my daughter and I are both using it and it's lasting for weeks! This is my new favorite conditioner.  This does not weight my hair down in the least - instead it makes my curls spring and bounce.  I have 2c-3b (mostly 3a) low porosity, coarse curls. I wish I'd found this conditioner a long time ago! I am crazy about the smell...like vacation on Maui!"

Bigger bottle please,Hi I have 3c curly hair and its bleach blonde and I been looking for something to replace my Cantu curl cream activator that I love but it's getting harder to find so I tried this curl defining cream and I really like it. My curls are shiny and  bouncy I do use a gel after nut I like it alot. I will say my only complaint is for 13 bucks I wish the bottle was bigger.
10,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wave Killer,"This conditioner killed my waves completely. I've been using curly girl approved products and building up my waves for about a year now and after one use of this conditioner my hair was straighter than before I started. I tried clarifying my hair and giving it another shot, but got the same results.The consistency of this product does seem strange, as other reviews stated. It's VERY watery, but I've never used it before so it's possible that this is normal and not the result of tampering.All in all, it makes my hair very soft and smooth, but I wouldn't recommend for wavy hair."
11,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved this until..,"So I have been having issues with allergies. My old cowash and conditioner started making me break out in hives (yikes) so I switched to a new cowash and this conditioner. I personally love this brand and had never used their hair products.The conditioner, while called pineapple, to me smells just like banana runts. I really loved it. Made my hair soft and made the wave and curl in my hair pop.Unfortunately, I started to have issues where everytime I used it, it made my head itch terribly. When I compared it to the other stuff I had issues with, I found an ingredient that they shared. So when looking for something new, I spent a lot of time to find something without that ingredient.Do highly recommend it though! Wish I could still use it."
12,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",1.0 out of 5 stars,Counterfeit or Watered Down...,I love this product but it is definitely not the same product I've used in the past. It is much more watery - not the nice thick cream it normally is. I also noticed there was an ingredient sticker placed over the ingredients on the bottle. I checked the reviews to see if others had noticed anything different and sure enough some had and at least one person also had the sticker over the ingredients. I requested a refund and I am going to buy this one in store from now on. What a bummer because subscribe-and-save is so convenient.
13,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not even close to the Deva Curl Wavemaker,"If I use it with just mousse it does not moisture my hair enough, it actually leaves it quite dry and frizzy. I really wanted to like it because the packaging is so cute and many said the smell was great. To me the scent is nice but not as strong as say Cantu. I am using it mixed with Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus smoothie because that was too moisturizing lol so mixed together they work great. I am still searching for a replacement for the Devs Curl wavaker. This ain't it. For reference, I have thin, low density, medium porosity, 2C-3A hair."

My curls dragged down, so the next time I used less & my curls were bouncier. An unexpected benefit is that my thick hair wets down more easier for shampooing when I use this curl cream. I have thick hair & we have a lot of minerals in our water."

I am a natural blonde with thick curly short hair. This product is awesome. I wet my hair a little bit with Pacifica hair and body spray or water and then use the cream to crunch in my curls. Looks awesome every time."
16,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very different products,"Shampoo:-Nice light scent, pleasant and not overly sweet-Foamy and cleansing, while still being gentle-Hair feels super soft, even after rinsing-12oz bottle, nice designConditioner:-Same scent, maybe a bit muted-Wayyy to thin, it doesn't truly condition-Ruins the soft feeling from the shampoo-8oz bottle, and much more is needed than the shampoo. It'll run out way before the shampoo with the amount needed for it to somewhat work as conditioner. Even then, I don't think it's worth even using it.Conclusion:I absolutely recommend the shampoo, and I'll continue to use it. The conditioner may wind up in the trash. :("

I have read multiple positive reviews about this product so I decided to try it.Now what I have learned in this journey is that your curls are not the same as mine so let me tell you about my curls. I have pretty tight curls. My hair is THIIIRRRRSSSTTTY so it desires moisture and my hair is average (not too thick or too thin)With this description, I’d like to tell you that my hair loved this product. It smells delicious, it works fabulous as a leave in but it is a tad runny so I used a lot. I think I used it 4 times and it’s gone. I’m going to buy it again because it made my hair bouncy, light and it looked moisturized."

I bought it again and now it is very thin and even a bit foamy and it's like I didn't use conditioner at all.  I suspect this was a return that someone added water or something to.  To test that theory, I attempted a return and lo and behold they do allow returns.  I'm just throwing it....obviously Amazon is selling USED toiletries as NEW."

I’ve been working to encourage and develop it. I took a shot on this set, and wish I hadn’t. It made my hair so silky, that it doesn’t hold any texture at all. The pictures are my hair after the first wash with this set vs. it’s natural air dried wave. I don’t know how they market this as a product to help waves and curls. I’m just going to use it on my little girls straight hair and go back to Shea Moisture."

I layer this with a gel on soaking wet hair and it really helps define and clump. I would say it definitely needs a gel or a mousse because it has little to no hold.

I've spent a lot of my life looking for a product that wouldn't leave my hair hard as wax or greasy. I think I've finally found a product to stick with. I just hope irony doesn't rear its ugly head and then the place goes out of business leaving me searching for another 20 years.

I have 2c/3b hair texture w some loose curls here & there, Since I live in a hot humid area I’m always struggling w frizz & lack of definition. When using this mask I notice my hair seems more juicy & defined, & it smells great. Doesn’t feel heavy but it’s not light either(does that make sense?) but it provides enough moisture. I do find I need to use conditioner to be able to distribute it though out, as soon as it’s on, it feels very rich. works great so far. I would deff recommend to somebody who needs a little hydration boost."

It smells so good, like a yummy tropical vacation. I like the ingredients, I like that it doesn't have silicones. The best part of this conditioner is how lightweight it is, yet it actually detangles my hair. I have naturally wavy and very tangly hair and I always comb through it after putting conditioner in. This passes the comb-through test. A lot of other conditioners are just heavy, but don't actually detangle. This one detangles, makes my hair super soft and shiny after rinsing, enhances my natural wavy texture, and smells amazing. I will definitely be ordering more!!!!!"
24,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,My hair surprisingly loves this product,"I have 3c hair (confused on my exact porosity) and this is the only product I have been happy with after experimenting with other leave ins and oils for about a year. My hair loves moisture and it was difficult to find a leave in that wouldn't dry so quickly. What i really liked about this leave in was that I only needed water to refresh my curls after a while. Usually I have to redo my curls all together (re add random leave in, add water, try not to cry and get frustrated lol)  throughout the day and other products tend to make my hair stiff and dry so I try to find moisture combinations that work. I wasn't afraid to use this everyday and that says a lot.  I also noticed less shedding with this cream. I thought it was because I was taking better care of my hair in general, but when I ran out of Pacifica and started using not so good cheap products, my hair started to shed a lot again. This is the only product I feel like my hair is safe with for now! I literally just ordered my second bottle and the new curl pomade. My hair can't deal with the mess of gels and oils and random leave ins any longer. My only complaints are that I wish the bottle was bigger and the smell lasted longer. I think less is more because I have to make sure I spread the cream throughout my hair and use a little more water and oil combinations and then my hair is nice and soft and surprisingly bouncy. If your hair has a love-hate relationship with protein, then use less and make sure it's spread out evenly! (It contains coconut oil) It's meant to be a lightweight product, I just got carried away because I literally love this product lol. My hair is strange to me. As someone with fine curly wavyish strands but high volume ""ethnic"" hair, the right amount goes a long way.  I used way more than other reviews said because my hair loves the moisture. I was low-key surprised this worked on my hair type lol. It made my hair routine more enjoyable. Instead of redoing my hair when I want to refresh my curls now all I do is add water and maybe an oil to seal but this cream contains oil and leaves my scalp soft and massageable lol. I'm so wary of products that claim to be vegan and silicone free but this formula is what I needed so far."
25,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my dry curls,"I have super dry, curly, fine hair. I've basically been searching for balanced products my entire life. I had purchased Pacifica's lilac lotion, and knew their quality, so I took a gamble on the conditioner. Although pineapple is my favorite fruit, I must say this smells a little too sickly sweet for me (like right before a pineapple is about to go). That aside, OH MY GOD, it's the creamiest, non-greasy, buttery conditioner I have ever used! I LOVE how my curls feel and look, and the great news is that the scent mostly disappears after you rinse it out. Once my hair is dry I hardly notice the pineapple at all. I paid less than $5 here for my 8 oz. tube, and feel like I got a great bargain. The curls are shiny, bouncy, and my hair is SO soft. It's a winner!"
26,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Watery and not great quality - my heart is broken,"I bought this before and liked it before I learned about hair types and what good conditioners are supposed to feel like. Recently purchased again and was sad to find how terrible this product actually is.It’s very watery, which means you’ll go through the bottle quickly. Even with more product, it never actually seems to coat the hair, and does virtually nothing to detangle or give your hair any softness or silkiness.The scent is quite  strong for being one of the last ingredients. It’s a mix of pineapple and coconut, so if you’re looking to smell like an island (or a cocktail), look no further!But sadly, I’ve found better cheaper conditioners with more for my money at any drugstore.No hard feelings, Pineapple Curls. I really wanted to love you."
27,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing but not a thick conditioner,"My hair is low porosity, 3b, medium density, caucasian. My hair is weighed down easily so I like this light conditioner... it allows me to be more heavy handed with styling products, which I like. The consistency of this conditioner is rather thin and it takes a lot of product to feel like my hair is coated. And I have short hair. I like hyaluronic acid for my skin and hair, and I appreciate the curl-friendly, cruelty free ingredients. Beforehand I use a cowash or shampoo. After I rinse out the Pineapple Curls I put in leave-in conditioner. If your hair is thick or coarse in any way, you won't be satisfied with this. I can't image a lot of curly girls loving this, but if you have waves or loose curls this would be great for you."

I was afraid to even you something else because my hair is so thick and coarse and I didn't think anything else would work boy was I wrong I also used to shampoo with it I'm serious when I say I didn't have high hopes but I was willing to give it a try because I'm all about not hurting a bunny to clean my hair the stuff is vegan and cruelty-free I hope that matters to you all

After using the matching shampoo without issue, I applied this conditioner and the nightmare began. As soon as I squeezed the product through my tresses, I realized that there was a huge problem. My hair was no longer tangle-free. In fact I couldn't run my fingers through it at all. The hair was instantly deeply matted. It took 10 hours (over the span of 3 days....thank you God for the miracle of telecommuting....) to work out the tangled mess, cutting quite a bit along the way. And after all of that, I still couldn't free the last 15% and had to cut it down.I almost never leave reviews, but I had to try to help even 1 fellow Curly. IF YOU HAVE TYPE 4 COILS, THIS IS NOT YOUR PRODUCT!!! The attached picture is about 25% of what I lost (Bottle cap for scale).Curlfriend, just don't do it."
241,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Natural Conditioner, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, Sulfate Free and Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t be without it.,"I am a long time user of just about every Pacifica product and have never been disappointed.  My hair is healthy chest level length and colored bright red. I have a mix of small banana curls, waves, stretched out curls and a few straight pieces mixed in. with NY weather any day could be an unruly or a frizz day. And I hate gel and hair spray. I keep things natural. Icurrently use the sea salt wave cream and I love it but I wanted just a touch more of a “molded hold”.  It keeps my hair soft bouncy and I truly look like so just left the beach. This pineapple cream great and is a little thicker and has a Nice hold to it which does make Are my hair a little crunchy.  I mix the two and its perfect. Just what I want a nice full fluff with a touch of hold that isn’t sticky or stiff and they both smell delicious. I Will be buying stock in them both before they discontinue any thing."

Most curl creams I’ve tried either weighed my hair down or made my ends look dry. I have very sensitive skin so I am picky what goes on my hair. I used about a tablespoon of this with a denman brush and got the softest, shiniest, thickest wave/curl clumps I’ve ever had. I went out in 110* heat a few hours later and minimal frizz. I am very  happy and will definitely be using this every wash day. I wish they had a pineapple gel."

However, the the containers are NOT sealed. Why make such a nice product and not put a simple piece of foil or plastic? The lid came off during shipping from Amazon in their usual thin plastic one-day mailers and it spilled out all over three other items that I purchased. Please make products with a seal. That way people know that they’re getting the product that is supposed to be in the container, as packed from the manufacturer, and it’s more hygienic feeling to open a sealed product, and it doesn’t spill out all over everything resulting in product loss when shipped. Kudos to great products—Keep making wonderful products! I love all of the unique options, scents, and safer ingredients. Packaging is beautiful."

When my hair was still damp after my shower, I put this cream in and scrunched a bit. then I twisted it on top of my head and slept on it. When I woke up the next morning my hair was barely damp, but so soft and curly. I brushed through my hair with my fingers, scrunched a bit and went out the door (after coffee of course) I have gotten so many comments at work. The scent does fade, you won't smell like pineapple all day. The scent is actually up in the air. When the package first came I had everyone in my family smell. I smelled pineapple and so did one of my sons, My other son smelled coconut, as did my fiance. My daughter shrugged and said it smelled like pina colada. No regrets on this purchase though!"

It doesn’t dry out my hair. However, the conditioner is so watered down that my poor curls were so damaged from using it. I also have the leave in conditioner, but it does no justice for me either. It dried out my hair and leaves a heavy mousse sticky feel to my clean hair. I would continue to use the shampoo only. For reference, I have really fine wavy-curly hair"

This is the second bottle I’ve ordered, I noticed a difference in consistency when I gave my daughter the first bottle, but assumed they maybe changed the formula. I think this is counterfeit now with the second bottle after comparing, which  is disappointing, because a major factor in buying Pacifica products is that they are vegan and cruelty free, and with a counterfeit item you can pretty much guarantee that’s not the case.The left side of each photo is the bottle I just finished off, the right side is what was received from amazon.A) the bottles are very different, the amazon one looks and feels cheaply made, different graphic qualities too. Size is all wrong.B) the scent is not as strong and more vanilla with the amazon product, the product I normally buy has a strong fruity/pineapple scent.C) the consistency is SOOO different. The one I normally buy is thick and creamy, goes a long way. The one from amazon is thin like cheap conditioner."

I love pineapple and wanted to love this product so much, I bought the set.  I have long, thick, curly, indigenous hair that tends to frizz; I'm also sensitive to scents, and lean toward natural products. SHAMPOO: Has a light, sweet, real-fruit smell that wants more depth, more power. It does not smell pina colada-y but I think I do get a whiff of banana (not my favorite). I imagine that scent is hard to balance in hair products; overall I like it. The lather is super thick with a nice, clean silky rinse and leaves my wet hair feeling clean and soft instead of stripped, with truly defined spiral curls. I can't detect any pineapple scent in my hair after rinsing. Feels nice, a good shampoo that is gentle enough to use often. However, I prefer washing 1x/week, so that's a little too gentle for me. But I liked it and was excited to try a conditioner that would amplify and continue that sweet, soft, curly feeling. It disappointed. CONDITIONER: Same scent, no issues. Feels light but strange and slick going on, and is actually too light/thin for thick hair. I had to use a lot of it, more than other conditioners, and had to press it into my hair to absorb-- it felt like a rebellious conditioner that didn't want to perform. It left the exact opposite feeling from the shampoo: greasy residue, not natural, ill-formulated, and drying. It clings to my hair, not in the way you want, so I had to rinse and rinse and rinse, negating the initial good shampoo. Pacifica products are not cheap in price, but are becoming more cheap in feel. My search for curly-hair cleansing products continues...."

The best feature is that it smells delicious. It's a thin conditioner and I can barely believe that it's intended for textured hair since it provides almost no moisture. This is best for straight, low porosity hair. It does nothing for my medium porosity, frizz prone wavy-curly hair. Maui Moisture has so many better options for a drug store brand. I also like the Garnier conditioners in the jars. They are silicone free as well!"

4,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Cream, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, With Hyaluronic Acid + Coconut Oil, Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Curly Hair,"In the past couple months I have learned the Curly Girl Method and I have been experimenting with some shampoos and conditioners. I really REALLY like this one a lot. It has a fruity smell that is a bit strong but not so strong to deter me (That is actually what worried me the most because I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to strong smells, and especially the ""exotic"" pineapple, banana, and such smells really make me keel over in the mornings). Initially, out of the bottle it is a bit strong but after washing it really isn't that strong, the smell of my shampoo is actually stronger. Anyways, sometimes I don't put in argon oil after showering to help keep my curls and I notice that with this conditioner, without the oil, it still helps keeps my curls nice. They are softer and a little looser without the oil or styler but it works great and I have been getting lots of compliments!"

I have fine 2b high porosity hair (the kind that gets super frizzy in a little bit of humidity). I've used a tonne of products and this is def one of my all time favourites. It's alot like wavemaker and cantu - and I only use a peasized amount of it. Gives some volume (but doesn't make your hair feel weighed down or full of product). I don't really need to layer products with this but if I really want to, I add a spritz of the b&b invisible oil primer or homemade salt spray!"

It smells light and natural. I use a small pea sized amount for my shoulder length hair if I am pulling it back, and about twice that much if I am wearing it down. It defines the curls and keeps the frizzies down. It doesn't coat my hands, washes off easily, and doesn't weigh my hair down with heavy/waxy stuff like some products do. This small tube lasts a long time, too."

For the last 10 years or so I've been using DevaCurl, and I've rarely tried anything else.  I've been using 10-14 pumps of conditoner every day. I really overdid it the first time I tried Pineapple Curls and I was am still stunned that a small palmful coats and detangles all my hair! It's like I can't use a small enough amount!  I was worried that a 10 oz. tube would last me a week, but this conditioner is so concentrated, my daughter and I are both using it and it's lasting for weeks! This is my new favorite conditioner.  This does not weight my hair down in the least - instead it makes my curls spring and bounce.  I have 2c-3b (mostly 3a) low porosity, coarse curls. I wish I'd found this conditioner a long time ago! I am crazy about the smell...like vacation on Maui!"

I've been using curly girl approved products and building up my waves for about a year now and after one use of this conditioner my hair was straighter than before I started. I tried clarifying my hair and giving it another shot, but got the same results.The consistency of this product does seem strange, as other reviews stated. It's VERY watery, but I've never used it before so it's possible that this is normal and not the result of tampering.All in all, it makes my hair very soft and smooth, but I wouldn't recommend for wavy hair."

I personally love this brand and had never used their hair products.The conditioner, while called pineapple, to me smells just like banana runts. I really loved it. Made my hair soft and made the wave and curl in my hair pop.Unfortunately, I started to have issues where everytime I used it, it made my head itch terribly. When I compared it to the other stuff I had issues with, I found an ingredient that they shared. So when looking for something new, I spent a lot of time to find something without that ingredient.Do highly recommend it though! Wish I could still use it."

It is much more watery - not the nice thick cream it normally is. I also noticed there was an ingredient sticker placed over the ingredients on the bottle. I checked the reviews to see if others had noticed anything different and sure enough some had and at least one person also had the sticker over the ingredients. I requested a refund and I am going to buy this one in store from now on. What a bummer because subscribe-and-save is so convenient.

I really wanted to like it because the packaging is so cute and many said the smell was great. To me the scent is nice but not as strong as say Cantu. I am using it mixed with Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus smoothie because that was too moisturizing lol so mixed together they work great. I am still searching for a replacement for the Devs Curl wavaker. This ain't it. For reference, I have thin, low density, medium porosity, 2C-3A hair."

My curls dragged down, so the next time I used less & my curls were bouncier. An unexpected benefit is that my thick hair wets down more easier for shampooing when I use this curl cream. I have thick hair & we have a lot of minerals in our water."

I am a natural blonde with thick curly short hair. This product is awesome. I wet my hair a little bit with Pacifica hair and body spray or water and then use the cream to crunch in my curls. Looks awesome every time."
16,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Cream, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, With Hyaluronic Acid + Coconut Oil, Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very different products,"Shampoo:-Nice light scent, pleasant and not overly sweet-Foamy and cleansing, while still being gentle-Hair feels super soft, even after rinsing-12oz bottle, nice designConditioner:-Same scent, maybe a bit muted-Wayyy to thin, it doesn't truly condition-Ruins the soft feeling from the shampoo-8oz bottle, and much more is needed than the shampoo. It'll run out way before the shampoo with the amount needed for it to somewhat work as conditioner. Even then, I don't think it's worth even using it.Conclusion:I absolutely recommend the shampoo, and I'll continue to use it. The conditioner may wind up in the trash. :("

I have read multiple positive reviews about this product so I decided to try it.Now what I have learned in this journey is that your curls are not the same as mine so let me tell you about my curls. I have pretty tight curls. My hair is THIIIRRRRSSSTTTY so it desires moisture and my hair is average (not too thick or too thin)With this description, I’d like to tell you that my hair loved this product. It smells delicious, it works fabulous as a leave in but it is a tad runny so I used a lot. I think I used it 4 times and it’s gone. I’m going to buy it again because it made my hair bouncy, light and it looked moisturized."

I bought it again and now it is very thin and even a bit foamy and it's like I didn't use conditioner at all.  I suspect this was a return that someone added water or something to.  To test that theory, I attempted a return and lo and behold they do allow returns.  I'm just throwing it....obviously Amazon is selling USED toiletries as NEW."

I’ve been working to encourage and develop it. I took a shot on this set, and wish I hadn’t. It made my hair so silky, that it doesn’t hold any texture at all. The pictures are my hair after the first wash with this set vs. it’s natural air dried wave. I don’t know how they market this as a product to help waves and curls. I’m just going to use it on my little girls straight hair and go back to Shea Moisture."

I layer this with a gel on soaking wet hair and it really helps define and clump. I would say it definitely needs a gel or a mousse because it has little to no hold.

I've spent a lot of my life looking for a product that wouldn't leave my hair hard as wax or greasy. I think I've finally found a product to stick with. I just hope irony doesn't rear its ugly head and then the place goes out of business leaving me searching for another 20 years.

I have 2c/3b hair texture w some loose curls here & there, Since I live in a hot humid area I’m always struggling w frizz & lack of definition. When using this mask I notice my hair seems more juicy & defined, & it smells great. Doesn’t feel heavy but it’s not light either(does that make sense?) but it provides enough moisture. I do find I need to use conditioner to be able to distribute it though out, as soon as it’s on, it feels very rich. works great so far. I would deff recommend to somebody who needs a little hydration boost."

It smells so good, like a yummy tropical vacation. I like the ingredients, I like that it doesn't have silicones. The best part of this conditioner is how lightweight it is, yet it actually detangles my hair. I have naturally wavy and very tangly hair and I always comb through it after putting conditioner in. This passes the comb-through test. A lot of other conditioners are just heavy, but don't actually detangle. This one detangles, makes my hair super soft and shiny after rinsing, enhances my natural wavy texture, and smells amazing. I will definitely be ordering more!!!!!"
24,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Cream, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, With Hyaluronic Acid + Coconut Oil, Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,My hair surprisingly loves this product,"I have 3c hair (confused on my exact porosity) and this is the only product I have been happy with after experimenting with other leave ins and oils for about a year. My hair loves moisture and it was difficult to find a leave in that wouldn't dry so quickly. What i really liked about this leave in was that I only needed water to refresh my curls after a while. Usually I have to redo my curls all together (re add random leave in, add water, try not to cry and get frustrated lol)  throughout the day and other products tend to make my hair stiff and dry so I try to find moisture combinations that work. I wasn't afraid to use this everyday and that says a lot.  I also noticed less shedding with this cream. I thought it was because I was taking better care of my hair in general, but when I ran out of Pacifica and started using not so good cheap products, my hair started to shed a lot again. This is the only product I feel like my hair is safe with for now! I literally just ordered my second bottle and the new curl pomade. My hair can't deal with the mess of gels and oils and random leave ins any longer. My only complaints are that I wish the bottle was bigger and the smell lasted longer. I think less is more because I have to make sure I spread the cream throughout my hair and use a little more water and oil combinations and then my hair is nice and soft and surprisingly bouncy. If your hair has a love-hate relationship with protein, then use less and make sure it's spread out evenly! (It contains coconut oil) It's meant to be a lightweight product, I just got carried away because I literally love this product lol. My hair is strange to me. As someone with fine curly wavyish strands but high volume ""ethnic"" hair, the right amount goes a long way.  I used way more than other reviews said because my hair loves the moisture. I was low-key surprised this worked on my hair type lol. It made my hair routine more enjoyable. Instead of redoing my hair when I want to refresh my curls now all I do is add water and maybe an oil to seal but this cream contains oil and leaves my scalp soft and massageable lol. I'm so wary of products that claim to be vegan and silicone free but this formula is what I needed so far."
25,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Cream, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, With Hyaluronic Acid + Coconut Oil, Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my dry curls,"I have super dry, curly, fine hair. I've basically been searching for balanced products my entire life. I had purchased Pacifica's lilac lotion, and knew their quality, so I took a gamble on the conditioner. Although pineapple is my favorite fruit, I must say this smells a little too sickly sweet for me (like right before a pineapple is about to go). That aside, OH MY GOD, it's the creamiest, non-greasy, buttery conditioner I have ever used! I LOVE how my curls feel and look, and the great news is that the scent mostly disappears after you rinse it out. Once my hair is dry I hardly notice the pineapple at all. I paid less than $5 here for my 8 oz. tube, and feel like I got a great bargain. The curls are shiny, bouncy, and my hair is SO soft. It's a winner!"
26,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Cream, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, With Hyaluronic Acid + Coconut Oil, Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Watery and not great quality - my heart is broken,"I bought this before and liked it before I learned about hair types and what good conditioners are supposed to feel like. Recently purchased again and was sad to find how terrible this product actually is.It’s very watery, which means you’ll go through the bottle quickly. Even with more product, it never actually seems to coat the hair, and does virtually nothing to detangle or give your hair any softness or silkiness.The scent is quite  strong for being one of the last ingredients. It’s a mix of pineapple and coconut, so if you’re looking to smell like an island (or a cocktail), look no further!But sadly, I’ve found better cheaper conditioners with more for my money at any drugstore.No hard feelings, Pineapple Curls. I really wanted to love you."
27,"Pacifica Beauty, Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Cream, For Curly, Coily and Textured Hair Types, Fresh Pineapple Scent, With Hyaluronic Acid + Coconut Oil, Silicone Free, 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing but not a thick conditioner,"My hair is low porosity, 3b, medium density, caucasian. My hair is weighed down easily so I like this light conditioner... it allows me to be more heavy handed with styling products, which I like. The consistency of this conditioner is rather thin and it takes a lot of product to feel like my hair is coated. And I have short hair. I like hyaluronic acid for my skin and hair, and I appreciate the curl-friendly, cruelty free ingredients. Beforehand I use a cowash or shampoo. After I rinse out the Pineapple Curls I put in leave-in conditioner. If your hair is thick or coarse in any way, you won't be satisfied with this. I can't image a lot of curly girls loving this, but if you have waves or loose curls this would be great for you."

It smells great just like pineapple and the scent seems to last a long time however, it feels like it dries my curls out. Being a natural product this isn’t what I expected at all and I was highly disappointed. Go with something that’ll help your curls not damage them, would highly not recommend."

This product has an amazing smell to it. However, it didn't work for my hair at all. This product dried out my hair, and left my hair looking super greasy even after it was freshly washed.

After using the matching shampoo without issue, I applied this conditioner and the nightmare began. As soon as I squeezed the product through my tresses, I realized that there was a huge problem. My hair was no longer tangle-free. In fact I couldn't run my fingers through it at all. The hair was instantly deeply matted. It took 10 hours (over the span of 3 days....thank you God for the miracle of telecommuting....) to work out the tangled mess, cutting quite a bit along the way. And after all of that, I still couldn't free the last 15% and had to cut it down.I almost never leave reviews, but I had to try to help even 1 fellow Curly. IF YOU HAVE TYPE 4 COILS, THIS IS NOT YOUR PRODUCT!!! The attached picture is about 25% of what I lost (Bottle cap for scale).Curlfriend, just don't do it."

My hair is healthy chest level length and colored bright red. I have a mix of small banana curls, waves, stretched out curls and a few straight pieces mixed in. with NY weather any day could be an unruly or a frizz day. And I hate gel and hair spray. I keep things natural. Icurrently use the sea salt wave cream and I love it but I wanted just a touch more of a “molded hold”.  It keeps my hair soft bouncy and I truly look like so just left the beach. This pineapple cream great and is a little thicker and has a Nice hold to it which does make Are my hair a little crunchy.  I mix the two and its perfect. Just what I want a nice full fluff with a touch of hold that isn’t sticky or stiff and they both smell delicious. I Will be buying stock in them both before they discontinue any thing."

Most curl creams I’ve tried either weighed my hair down or made my ends look dry. I have very sensitive skin so I am picky what goes on my hair. I used about a tablespoon of this with a denman brush and got the softest, shiniest, thickest wave/curl clumps I’ve ever had. I went out in 110* heat a few hours later and minimal frizz. I am very  happy and will definitely be using this every wash day. I wish they had a pineapple gel."

However, the the containers are NOT sealed. Why make such a nice product and not put a simple piece of foil or plastic? The lid came off during shipping from Amazon in their usual thin plastic one-day mailers and it spilled out all over three other items that I purchased. Please make products with a seal. That way people know that they’re getting the product that is supposed to be in the container, as packed from the manufacturer, and it’s more hygienic feeling to open a sealed product, and it doesn’t spill out all over everything resulting in product loss when shipped. Kudos to great products—Keep making wonderful products! I love all of the unique options, scents, and safer ingredients. Packaging is beautiful."

When my hair was still damp after my shower, I put this cream in and scrunched a bit. then I twisted it on top of my head and slept on it. When I woke up the next morning my hair was barely damp, but so soft and curly. I brushed through my hair with my fingers, scrunched a bit and went out the door (after coffee of course) I have gotten so many comments at work. The scent does fade, you won't smell like pineapple all day. The scent is actually up in the air. When the package first came I had everyone in my family smell. I smelled pineapple and so did one of my sons, My other son smelled coconut, as did my fiance. My daughter shrugged and said it smelled like pina colada. No regrets on this purchase though!"

0,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t think this is legit.,"I LOVE this conditioner, it’s so good for my curly hair and works very well, that said what I received from my amazon subscribe and save order is NOT the conditioner I’ve been using.  This is the second bottle I’ve ordered, I noticed a difference in consistency when I gave my daughter the first bottle, but assumed they maybe changed the formula. I think this is counterfeit now with the second bottle after comparing, which  is disappointing, because a major factor in buying Pacifica products is that they are vegan and cruelty free, and with a counterfeit item you can pretty much guarantee that’s not the case.The left side of each photo is the bottle I just finished off, the right side is what was received from amazon.A) the bottles are very different, the amazon one looks and feels cheaply made, different graphic qualities too. Size is all wrong.B) the scent is not as strong and more vanilla with the amazon product, the product I normally buy has a strong fruity/pineapple scent.C) the consistency is SOOO different. The one I normally buy is thick and creamy, goes a long way. The one from amazon is thin like cheap conditioner."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Harsh conditioner negates the gentle shampoo,"(Reviewed as a set.) I love pineapple and wanted to love this product so much, I bought the set.  I have long, thick, curly, indigenous hair that tends to frizz; I'm also sensitive to scents, and lean toward natural products. SHAMPOO: Has a light, sweet, real-fruit smell that wants more depth, more power. It does not smell pina colada-y but I think I do get a whiff of banana (not my favorite). I imagine that scent is hard to balance in hair products; overall I like it. The lather is super thick with a nice, clean silky rinse and leaves my wet hair feeling clean and soft instead of stripped, with truly defined spiral curls. I can't detect any pineapple scent in my hair after rinsing. Feels nice, a good shampoo that is gentle enough to use often. However, I prefer washing 1x/week, so that's a little too gentle for me. But I liked it and was excited to try a conditioner that would amplify and continue that sweet, soft, curly feeling. It disappointed. CONDITIONER: Same scent, no issues. Feels light but strange and slick going on, and is actually too light/thin for thick hair. I had to use a lot of it, more than other conditioners, and had to press it into my hair to absorb-- it felt like a rebellious conditioner that didn't want to perform. It left the exact opposite feeling from the shampoo: greasy residue, not natural, ill-formulated, and drying. It clings to my hair, not in the way you want, so I had to rinse and rinse and rinse, negating the initial good shampoo. Pacifica products are not cheap in price, but are becoming more cheap in feel. My search for curly-hair cleansing products continues...."

The best feature is that it smells delicious. It's a thin conditioner and I can barely believe that it's intended for textured hair since it provides almost no moisture. This is best for straight, low porosity hair. It does nothing for my medium porosity, frizz prone wavy-curly hair. Maui Moisture has so many better options for a drug store brand. I also like the Garnier conditioners in the jars. They are silicone free as well!"

4,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Curly Hair,"In the past couple months I have learned the Curly Girl Method and I have been experimenting with some shampoos and conditioners. I really REALLY like this one a lot. It has a fruity smell that is a bit strong but not so strong to deter me (That is actually what worried me the most because I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to strong smells, and especially the ""exotic"" pineapple, banana, and such smells really make me keel over in the mornings). Initially, out of the bottle it is a bit strong but after washing it really isn't that strong, the smell of my shampoo is actually stronger. Anyways, sometimes I don't put in argon oil after showering to help keep my curls and I notice that with this conditioner, without the oil, it still helps keeps my curls nice. They are softer and a little looser without the oil or styler but it works great and I have been getting lots of compliments!"
5,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for fine hair - a dupe for wavemaker.,"I was really hesitant to try this but I'm so glad I did. I have fine 2b high porosity hair (the kind that gets super frizzy in a little bit of humidity). I've used a tonne of products and this is def one of my all time favourites. It's alot like wavemaker and cantu - and I only use a peasized amount of it. Gives some volume (but doesn't make your hair feel weighed down or full of product). I don't really need to layer products with this but if I really want to, I add a spritz of the b&b invisible oil primer or homemade salt spray!"
6,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly light and long-lasting,"Love this stuff. It smells light and natural. I use a small pea sized amount for my shoulder length hair if I am pulling it back, and about twice that much if I am wearing it down. It defines the curls and keeps the frizzies down. It doesn't coat my hands, washes off easily, and doesn't weigh my hair down with heavy/waxy stuff like some products do. This small tube lasts a long time, too."
7,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls POP and BOUNCE,"For my whole life I needed two bottles of conditioner per one bottle of shampoo...and that was just for the stuff I wasn't using for co-washing.  For the last 10 years or so I've been using DevaCurl, and I've rarely tried anything else.  I've been using 10-14 pumps of conditoner every day. I really overdid it the first time I tried Pineapple Curls and I was am still stunned that a small palmful coats and detangles all my hair! It's like I can't use a small enough amount!  I was worried that a 10 oz. tube would last me a week, but this conditioner is so concentrated, my daughter and I are both using it and it's lasting for weeks! This is my new favorite conditioner.  This does not weight my hair down in the least - instead it makes my curls spring and bounce.  I have 2c-3b (mostly 3a) low porosity, coarse curls. I wish I'd found this conditioner a long time ago! I am crazy about the smell...like vacation on Maui!"

Bigger bottle please,Hi I have 3c curly hair and its bleach blonde and I been looking for something to replace my Cantu curl cream activator that I love but it's getting harder to find so I tried this curl defining cream and I really like it. My curls are shiny and  bouncy I do use a gel after nut I like it alot. I will say my only complaint is for 13 bucks I wish the bottle was bigger.
10,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wave Killer,"This conditioner killed my waves completely. I've been using curly girl approved products and building up my waves for about a year now and after one use of this conditioner my hair was straighter than before I started. I tried clarifying my hair and giving it another shot, but got the same results.The consistency of this product does seem strange, as other reviews stated. It's VERY watery, but I've never used it before so it's possible that this is normal and not the result of tampering.All in all, it makes my hair very soft and smooth, but I wouldn't recommend for wavy hair."
11,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved this until..,"So I have been having issues with allergies. My old cowash and conditioner started making me break out in hives (yikes) so I switched to a new cowash and this conditioner. I personally love this brand and had never used their hair products.The conditioner, while called pineapple, to me smells just like banana runts. I really loved it. Made my hair soft and made the wave and curl in my hair pop.Unfortunately, I started to have issues where everytime I used it, it made my head itch terribly. When I compared it to the other stuff I had issues with, I found an ingredient that they shared. So when looking for something new, I spent a lot of time to find something without that ingredient.Do highly recommend it though! Wish I could still use it."
12,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Counterfeit or Watered Down...,I love this product but it is definitely not the same product I've used in the past. It is much more watery - not the nice thick cream it normally is. I also noticed there was an ingredient sticker placed over the ingredients on the bottle. I checked the reviews to see if others had noticed anything different and sure enough some had and at least one person also had the sticker over the ingredients. I requested a refund and I am going to buy this one in store from now on. What a bummer because subscribe-and-save is so convenient.
13,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not even close to the Deva Curl Wavemaker,"If I use it with just mousse it does not moisture my hair enough, it actually leaves it quite dry and frizzy. I really wanted to like it because the packaging is so cute and many said the smell was great. To me the scent is nice but not as strong as say Cantu. I am using it mixed with Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus smoothie because that was too moisturizing lol so mixed together they work great. I am still searching for a replacement for the Devs Curl wavaker. This ain't it. For reference, I have thin, low density, medium porosity, 2C-3A hair."
14,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to manage hair & great scent,"This smells so good, I used too much the first time, just to inhale the tropical scent. My curls dragged down, so the next time I used less & my curls were bouncier. An unexpected benefit is that my thick hair wets down more easier for shampooing when I use this curl cream. I have thick hair & we have a lot of minerals in our water."
15,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product for my curls,"When my hairstylist told me that I should go with my natural curls, I tried so many different products but nothing seemed to work right. I am a natural blonde with thick curly short hair. This product is awesome. I wet my hair a little bit with Pacifica hair and body spray or water and then use the cream to crunch in my curls. Looks awesome every time."
16,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very different products,"Shampoo:-Nice light scent, pleasant and not overly sweet-Foamy and cleansing, while still being gentle-Hair feels super soft, even after rinsing-12oz bottle, nice designConditioner:-Same scent, maybe a bit muted-Wayyy to thin, it doesn't truly condition-Ruins the soft feeling from the shampoo-8oz bottle, and much more is needed than the shampoo. It'll run out way before the shampoo with the amount needed for it to somewhat work as conditioner. Even then, I don't think it's worth even using it.Conclusion:I absolutely recommend the shampoo, and I'll continue to use it. The conditioner may wind up in the trash. :("
17,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good conditioner,"I have been CGM for 18 months. I have read multiple positive reviews about this product so I decided to try it.Now what I have learned in this journey is that your curls are not the same as mine so let me tell you about my curls. I have pretty tight curls. My hair is THIIIRRRRSSSTTTY so it desires moisture and my hair is average (not too thick or too thin)With this description, I’d like to tell you that my hair loved this product. It smells delicious, it works fabulous as a leave in but it is a tad runny so I used a lot. I think I used it 4 times and it’s gone. I’m going to buy it again because it made my hair bouncy, light and it looked moisturized."
18,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Too thin...seems like a watered down return,"I've bought this conditioner before and loved it.  I bought it again and now it is very thin and even a bit foamy and it's like I didn't use conditioner at all.  I suspect this was a return that someone added water or something to.  To test that theory, I attempted a return and lo and behold they do allow returns.  I'm just throwing it....obviously Amazon is selling USED toiletries as NEW."
19,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Killed my waves,"Naturally my hair does a beach wave. I’ve been working to encourage and develop it. I took a shot on this set, and wish I hadn’t. It made my hair so silky, that it doesn’t hold any texture at all. The pictures are my hair after the first wash with this set vs. it’s natural air dried wave. I don’t know how they market this as a product to help waves and curls. I’m just going to use it on my little girls straight hair and go back to Shea Moisture."
20,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight,Great product for wavy hair. I layer this with a gel on soaking wet hair and it really helps define and clump. I would say it definitely needs a gel or a mousse because it has little to no hold. Has a faint coconut scent to me I don’t get pineapple at all
21,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not greasy, leaves hair feeling soft <3",Easily one of the best products I've ever used (33y). I've spent a lot of my life looking for a product that wouldn't leave my hair hard as wax or greasy. I think I've finally found a product to stick with. I just hope irony doesn't rear its ugly head and then the place goes out of business leaving me searching for another 20 years.
22,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hydration,"It provides a great hydration to my hair. I have 2c/3b hair texture w some loose curls here & there, Since I live in a hot humid area I’m always struggling w frizz & lack of definition. When using this mask I notice my hair seems more juicy & defined, & it smells great. Doesn’t feel heavy but it’s not light either(does that make sense?) but it provides enough moisture. I do find I need to use conditioner to be able to distribute it though out, as soon as it’s on, it feels very rich. works great so far. I would deff recommend to somebody who needs a little hydration boost."
23,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm obsessed...,"I accidentally ordered 2 of these instead of 1, but I'm in love with this conditioner so I'm happy for the spare!! It smells so good, like a yummy tropical vacation. I like the ingredients, I like that it doesn't have silicones. The best part of this conditioner is how lightweight it is, yet it actually detangles my hair. I have naturally wavy and very tangly hair and I always comb through it after putting conditioner in. This passes the comb-through test. A lot of other conditioners are just heavy, but don't actually detangle. This one detangles, makes my hair super soft and shiny after rinsing, enhances my natural wavy texture, and smells amazing. I will definitely be ordering more!!!!!"
24,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,My hair surprisingly loves this product,"I have 3c hair (confused on my exact porosity) and this is the only product I have been happy with after experimenting with other leave ins and oils for about a year. My hair loves moisture and it was difficult to find a leave in that wouldn't dry so quickly. What i really liked about this leave in was that I only needed water to refresh my curls after a while. Usually I have to redo my curls all together (re add random leave in, add water, try not to cry and get frustrated lol)  throughout the day and other products tend to make my hair stiff and dry so I try to find moisture combinations that work. I wasn't afraid to use this everyday and that says a lot.  I also noticed less shedding with this cream. I thought it was because I was taking better care of my hair in general, but when I ran out of Pacifica and started using not so good cheap products, my hair started to shed a lot again. This is the only product I feel like my hair is safe with for now! I literally just ordered my second bottle and the new curl pomade. My hair can't deal with the mess of gels and oils and random leave ins any longer. My only complaints are that I wish the bottle was bigger and the smell lasted longer. I think less is more because I have to make sure I spread the cream throughout my hair and use a little more water and oil combinations and then my hair is nice and soft and surprisingly bouncy. If your hair has a love-hate relationship with protein, then use less and make sure it's spread out evenly! (It contains coconut oil) It's meant to be a lightweight product, I just got carried away because I literally love this product lol. My hair is strange to me. As someone with fine curly wavyish strands but high volume ""ethnic"" hair, the right amount goes a long way.  I used way more than other reviews said because my hair loves the moisture. I was low-key surprised this worked on my hair type lol. It made my hair routine more enjoyable. Instead of redoing my hair when I want to refresh my curls now all I do is add water and maybe an oil to seal but this cream contains oil and leaves my scalp soft and massageable lol. I'm so wary of products that claim to be vegan and silicone free but this formula is what I needed so far."
25,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my dry curls,"I have super dry, curly, fine hair. I've basically been searching for balanced products my entire life. I had purchased Pacifica's lilac lotion, and knew their quality, so I took a gamble on the conditioner. Although pineapple is my favorite fruit, I must say this smells a little too sickly sweet for me (like right before a pineapple is about to go). That aside, OH MY GOD, it's the creamiest, non-greasy, buttery conditioner I have ever used! I LOVE how my curls feel and look, and the great news is that the scent mostly disappears after you rinse it out. Once my hair is dry I hardly notice the pineapple at all. I paid less than $5 here for my 8 oz. tube, and feel like I got a great bargain. The curls are shiny, bouncy, and my hair is SO soft. It's a winner!"
26,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Watery and not great quality - my heart is broken,"I bought this before and liked it before I learned about hair types and what good conditioners are supposed to feel like. Recently purchased again and was sad to find how terrible this product actually is.It’s very watery, which means you’ll go through the bottle quickly. Even with more product, it never actually seems to coat the hair, and does virtually nothing to detangle or give your hair any softness or silkiness.The scent is quite  strong for being one of the last ingredients. It’s a mix of pineapple and coconut, so if you’re looking to smell like an island (or a cocktail), look no further!But sadly, I’ve found better cheaper conditioners with more for my money at any drugstore.No hard feelings, Pineapple Curls. I really wanted to love you."
27,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing but not a thick conditioner,"My hair is low porosity, 3b, medium density, caucasian. My hair is weighed down easily so I like this light conditioner... it allows me to be more heavy handed with styling products, which I like. The consistency of this conditioner is rather thin and it takes a lot of product to feel like my hair is coated. And I have short hair. I like hyaluronic acid for my skin and hair, and I appreciate the curl-friendly, cruelty free ingredients. Beforehand I use a cowash or shampoo. After I rinse out the Pineapple Curls I put in leave-in conditioner. If your hair is thick or coarse in any way, you won't be satisfied with this. I can't image a lot of curly girls loving this, but if you have waves or loose curls this would be great for you."
28,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff,I have a head full of natural curly hair and for years I've been using wen. I was afraid to even you something else because my hair is so thick and coarse and I didn't think anything else would work boy was I wrong I also used to shampoo with it I'm serious when I say I didn't have high hopes but I was willing to give it a try because I'm all about not hurting a bunny to clean my hair the stuff is vegan and cruelty-free I hope that matters to you all
29,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Weightless Definition,Love this stuff! Summertime my hair needs help being tamed and in winter it needs some extra hydration and help to get my curls back. This product does it all!

What I received is not the same as what I've been using.  The bottle didn't ""feel"" right, the colors/design/size of the bottle was off, there was no foil safety seal on the tube opening, the scent of the product wasn't anything fruity as you would expect from something with pineapple in the name ... I don't think that this is legit Pacifica product.  Returned immediately."
35,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great but that’s it,"Having extremely curly hair I was looking for a change up in my routine and decided I’d give this one a try from the high reviews. It smells great just like pineapple and the scent seems to last a long time however, it feels like it dries my curls out. Being a natural product this isn’t what I expected at all and I was highly disappointed. Go with something that’ll help your curls not damage them, would highly not recommend."
36,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for me!,"I wish there was more per bottle or larger ounces available because I use a golfball sized amount or more (my hair goes past my mid back). The scent is 10/10 and just lightly lingers for 3ish days after wash. This doesn't FEEL lightweight when using because it has oils in it and an amazing slip for detangling. However, my hair doesn't seem like it's weighed out at all."

Smooth, Bouncy, Perfect Curls","I really didn't know it was possible for a curl product to work this well.

I will never be without this product ever again."

This product has an amazing smell to it. However, it didn't work for my hair at all. This product dried out my hair, and left my hair looking super greasy even after it was freshly washed. The first few tries, I thought this effect was from using too much product. However, I still had this issue even when using a very small amount of product. I would not reccomend this product."

I have wavy, voluminous hair that easily turns into a hot frizzy mess.

My daughter has thick curly hair and I am unable to run a comb or brush through her hair even with the conditioner still in. I had to check the bottle and make sure I didn’t accidentally order the shampoo because it does not feel conditioning at all. However, it does seem to be good quality.

240,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT FOR KINKY/COILY HAIR!,"My hair was completely detangled and knit-free at the beginning of the washing process. After using the matching shampoo without issue, I applied this conditioner and the nightmare began. As soon as I squeezed the product through my tresses, I realized that there was a huge problem. My hair was no longer tangle-free. In fact I couldn't run my fingers through it at all. The hair was instantly deeply matted. It took 10 hours (over the span of 3 days....thank you God for the miracle of telecommuting....) to work out the tangled mess, cutting quite a bit along the way. And after all of that, I still couldn't free the last 15% and had to cut it down.I almost never leave reviews, but I had to try to help even 1 fellow Curly. IF YOU HAVE TYPE 4 COILS, THIS IS NOT YOUR PRODUCT!!! The attached picture is about 25% of what I lost (Bottle cap for scale).Curlfriend, just don't do it."
241,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t be without it.,"I am a long time user of just about every Pacifica product and have never been disappointed.  My hair is healthy chest level length and colored bright red. I have a mix of small banana curls, waves, stretched out curls and a few straight pieces mixed in. with NY weather any day could be an unruly or a frizz day. And I hate gel and hair spray. I keep things natural. Icurrently use the sea salt wave cream and I love it but I wanted just a touch more of a “molded hold”.  It keeps my hair soft bouncy and I truly look like so just left the beach. This pineapple cream great and is a little thicker and has a Nice hold to it which does make Are my hair a little crunchy.  I mix the two and its perfect. Just what I want a nice full fluff with a touch of hold that isn’t sticky or stiff and they both smell delicious. I Will be buying stock in them both before they discontinue any thing."

Most curl creams I’ve tried either weighed my hair down or made my ends look dry. I have very sensitive skin so I am picky what goes on my hair. I used about a tablespoon of this with a denman brush and got the softest, shiniest, thickest wave/curl clumps I’ve ever had. I went out in 110* heat a few hours later and minimal frizz. I am very  happy and will definitely be using this every wash day. I wish they had a pineapple gel."

However, the the containers are NOT sealed. Why make such a nice product and not put a simple piece of foil or plastic? The lid came off during shipping from Amazon in their usual thin plastic one-day mailers and it spilled out all over three other items that I purchased. Please make products with a seal. That way people know that they’re getting the product that is supposed to be in the container, as packed from the manufacturer, and it’s more hygienic feeling to open a sealed product, and it doesn’t spill out all over everything resulting in product loss when shipped. Kudos to great products—Keep making wonderful products! I love all of the unique options, scents, and safer ingredients. Packaging is beautiful."

270,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Hair Mask, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Coconut, 6 Fl.Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,better than expected,"first i will disclose i used the matching shampoo and conditioner first. When my hair was still damp after my shower, I put this cream in and scrunched a bit. then I twisted it on top of my head and slept on it. When I woke up the next morning my hair was barely damp, but so soft and curly. I brushed through my hair with my fingers, scrunched a bit and went out the door (after coffee of course) I have gotten so many comments at work. The scent does fade, you won't smell like pineapple all day. The scent is actually up in the air. When the package first came I had everyone in my family smell. I smelled pineapple and so did one of my sons, My other son smelled coconut, as did my fiance. My daughter shrugged and said it smelled like pina colada. No regrets on this purchase though!"

This is the second bottle I’ve ordered, I noticed a difference in consistency when I gave my daughter the first bottle, but assumed they maybe changed the formula. I think this is counterfeit now with the second bottle after comparing, which  is disappointing, because a major factor in buying Pacifica products is that they are vegan and cruelty free, and with a counterfeit item you can pretty much guarantee that’s not the case.The left side of each photo is the bottle I just finished off, the right side is what was received from amazon.A) the bottles are very different, the amazon one looks and feels cheaply made, different graphic qualities too. Size is all wrong.B) the scent is not as strong and more vanilla with the amazon product, the product I normally buy has a strong fruity/pineapple scent.C) the consistency is SOOO different.

I love pineapple and wanted to love this product so much, I bought the set.  I have long, thick, curly, indigenous hair that tends to frizz; I'm also sensitive to scents, and lean toward natural products. SHAMPOO: Has a light, sweet, real-fruit smell that wants more depth, more power. It does not smell pina colada-y but I think I do get a whiff of banana (not my favorite). I imagine that scent is hard to balance in hair products; overall I like it. The lather is super thick with a nice, clean silky rinse and leaves my wet hair feeling clean and soft instead of stripped, with truly defined spiral curls. I can't detect any pineapple scent in my hair after rinsing. Feels nice, a good shampoo that is gentle enough to use often. However, I prefer washing 1x/week, so that's a little too gentle for me. But I liked it and was excited to try a conditioner that would amplify and continue that sweet, soft, curly feeling. It disappointed. CONDITIONER: Same scent, no issues. Feels light but strange and slick going on, and is actually too light/thin for thick hair. I had to use a lot of it, more than other conditioners, and had to press it into my hair to absorb-- it felt like a rebellious conditioner that didn't want to perform. It left the exact opposite feeling from the shampoo: greasy residue, not natural, ill-formulated, and drying. It clings to my hair, not in the way you want, so I had to rinse and rinse and rinse, negating the initial good shampoo. Pacifica products are not cheap in price, but are becoming more cheap in feel. My search for curly-hair cleansing products continues...."

The best feature is that it smells delicious. It's a thin conditioner and I can barely believe that it's intended for textured hair since it provides almost no moisture. This is best for straight, low porosity hair. It does nothing for my medium porosity, frizz prone wavy-curly hair. Maui Moisture has so many better options for a drug store brand. I also like the Garnier conditioners in the jars. They are silicone free as well!"

I really REALLY like this one a lot. It has a fruity smell that is a bit strong but not so strong to deter me (That is actually what worried me the most because I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to strong smells, and especially the ""exotic"" pineapple, banana, and such smells really make me keel over in the mornings). Initially, out of the bottle it is a bit strong but after washing it really isn't that strong, the smell of my shampoo is actually stronger. Anyways, sometimes I don't put in argon oil after showering to help keep my curls and I notice that with this conditioner, without the oil, it still helps keeps my curls nice. They are softer and a little looser without the oil or styler but it works great and I have been getting lots of compliments!"

It's alot like wavemaker and cantu - and I only use a peasized amount of it. Gives some volume (but doesn't make your hair feel weighed down or full of product). I don't really need to layer products with this but if I really want to, I add a spritz of the b&b invisible oil primer or homemade salt spray!"

For the last 10 years or so I've been using DevaCurl, and I've rarely tried anything else.  I've been using 10-14 pumps of conditoner every day. I really overdid it the first time I tried Pineapple Curls and I was am still stunned that a small palmful coats and detangles all my hair! It's like I can't use a small enough amount!  I was worried that a 10 oz. tube would last me a week, but this conditioner is so concentrated, my daughter and I are both using it and it's lasting for weeks! This is my new favorite conditioner.  This does not weight my hair down in the least - instead it makes my curls spring and bounce.  I have 2c-3b (mostly 3a) low porosity, coarse curls. I wish I'd found this conditioner a long time ago! I am crazy about the smell...like vacation on Maui!"

I've been using curly girl approved products and building up my waves for about a year now and after one use of this conditioner my hair was straighter than before I started. I tried clarifying my hair and giving it another shot, but got the same results.The consistency of this product does seem strange, as other reviews stated. It's VERY watery, but I've never used it before so it's possible that this is normal and not the result of tampering.All in all, it makes my hair very soft and smooth, but I wouldn't recommend for wavy hair."

My old cowash and conditioner started making me break out in hives (yikes) so I switched to a new cowash and this conditioner. I personally love this brand and had never used their hair products.The conditioner, while called pineapple, to me smells just like banana runts. I really loved it. Made my hair soft and made the wave and curl in my hair pop.Unfortunately, I started to have issues where everytime I used it, it made my head itch terribly. When I compared it to the other stuff I had issues with, I found an ingredient that they shared. So when looking for something new, I spent a lot of time to find something without that ingredient.Do highly recommend it though! Wish I could still use it."

The best part of this conditioner is how lightweight it is, yet it actually detangles my hair. I have naturally wavy and very tangly hair and I always comb through it after putting conditioner in. This passes the comb-through test. A lot of other conditioners are just heavy, but don't actually detangle.

My hair loves moisture and it was difficult to find a leave in that wouldn't dry so quickly. What i really liked about this leave in was that I only needed water to refresh my curls after a while. Usually I have to redo my curls all together (re add random leave in, add water, try not to cry and get frustrated lol)  throughout the day and other products tend to make my hair stiff and dry so I try to find moisture combinations that work. I wasn't afraid to use this everyday and that says a lot.  I also noticed less shedding with this cream. I thought it was because I was taking better care of my hair in general, but when I ran out of Pacifica and started using not so good cheap products, my hair started to shed a lot again. This is the only product I feel like my hair is safe with for now! I literally just ordered my second bottle and the new curl pomade. My hair can't deal with the mess of gels and oils and random leave ins any longer. My only complaints are that I wish the bottle was bigger and the smell lasted longer. I think less is more because I have to make sure I spread the cream throughout my hair and use a little more water and oil combinations and then my hair is nice and soft and surprisingly bouncy. If your hair has a love-hate relationship with protein, then use less and make sure it's spread out evenly! (It contains coconut oil) It's meant to be a lightweight product, I just got carried away because I literally love this product lol. My hair is strange to me. As someone with fine curly wavyish strands but high volume ""ethnic"" hair, the right amount goes a long way.  I used way more than other reviews said because my hair loves the moisture. I was low-key surprised this worked on my hair type lol. It made my hair routine more enjoyable. Instead of redoing my hair when I want to refresh my curls now all I do is add water and maybe an oil to seal but this cream contains oil and leaves my scalp soft and massageable lol. I'm so wary of products that claim to be vegan and silicone free but this formula is what I needed so far."

I've basically been searching for balanced products my entire life. I had purchased Pacifica's lilac lotion, and knew their quality, so I took a gamble on the conditioner. Although pineapple is my favorite fruit, I must say this smells a little too sickly sweet for me (like right before a pineapple is about to go). That aside, OH MY GOD, it's the creamiest, non-greasy, buttery conditioner I have ever used! I LOVE how my curls feel and look, and the great news is that the scent mostly disappears after you rinse it out. Once my hair is dry I hardly notice the pineapple at all. I paid less than $5 here for my 8 oz. tube, and feel like I got a great bargain. The curls are shiny, bouncy, and my hair is SO soft. It's a winner!"

Recently purchased again and was sad to find how terrible this product actually is.It’s very watery, which means you’ll go through the bottle quickly. Even with more product, it never actually seems to coat the hair, and does virtually nothing to detangle or give your hair any softness or silkiness.The scent is quite  strong for being one of the last ingredients. It’s a mix of pineapple and coconut, so if you’re looking to smell like an island (or a cocktail), look no further!But sadly, I’ve found better cheaper conditioners with more for my money at any drugstore.No hard feelings, Pineapple Curls. I really wanted to love you."

My hair is weighed down easily so I like this light conditioner... it allows me to be more heavy handed with styling products, which I like. The consistency of this conditioner is rather thin and it takes a lot of product to feel like my hair is coated. And I have short hair. I like hyaluronic acid for my skin and hair, and I appreciate the curl-friendly, cruelty free ingredients. Beforehand I use a cowash or shampoo. After I rinse out the Pineapple Curls I put in leave-in conditioner. If your hair is thick or coarse in any way, you won't be satisfied with this. I can't image a lot of curly girls loving this, but if you have waves or loose curls this would be great for you."

After using the matching shampoo without issue, I applied this conditioner and the nightmare began. As soon as I squeezed the product through my tresses, I realized that there was a huge problem. My hair was no longer tangle-free. In fact I couldn't run my fingers through it at all. The hair was instantly deeply matted. It took 10 hours (over the span of 3 days....thank you God for the miracle of telecommuting....) to work out the tangled mess, cutting quite a bit along the way. And after all of that, I still couldn't free the last 15% and had to cut it down.I almost never leave reviews, but I had to try to help even 1 fellow Curly. IF YOU HAVE TYPE 4 COILS, THIS IS NOT YOUR PRODUCT!!! The attached picture is about 25% of what I lost (Bottle cap for scale).Curlfriend, just don't do it."

My hair is healthy chest level length and colored bright red. I have a mix of small banana curls, waves, stretched out curls and a few straight pieces mixed in. with NY weather any day could be an unruly or a frizz day. And I hate gel and hair spray. I keep things natural. Icurrently use the sea salt wave cream and I love it but I wanted just a touch more of a “molded hold”.  It keeps my hair soft bouncy and I truly look like so just left the beach. This pineapple cream great and is a little thicker and has a Nice hold to it which does make Are my hair a little crunchy.  I mix the two and its perfect. Just what I want a nice full fluff with a touch of hold that isn’t sticky or stiff and they both smell delicious. I Will be buying stock in them both before they discontinue any thing."

Most curl creams I’ve tried either weighed my hair down or made my ends look dry. I have very sensitive skin so I am picky what goes on my hair. I used about a tablespoon of this with a denman brush and got the softest, shiniest, thickest wave/curl clumps I’ve ever had. I went out in 110* heat a few hours later and minimal frizz. I am very  happy and will definitely be using this every wash day. I wish they had a pineapple gel."

However, the the containers are NOT sealed. Why make such a nice product and not put a simple piece of foil or plastic? The lid came off during shipping from Amazon in their usual thin plastic one-day mailers and it spilled out all over three other items that I purchased. Please make products with a seal. That way people know that they’re getting the product that is supposed to be in the container, as packed from the manufacturer, and it’s more hygienic feeling to open a sealed product, and it doesn’t spill out all over everything resulting in product loss when shipped.

When my hair was still damp after my shower, I put this cream in and scrunched a bit. then I twisted it on top of my head and slept on it. When I woke up the next morning my hair was barely damp, but so soft and curly. I brushed through my hair with my fingers, scrunched a bit and went out the door (after coffee of course) I have gotten so many comments at work. The scent does fade, you won't smell like pineapple all day. The scent is actually up in the air. When the package first came I had everyone in my family smell. I smelled pineapple and so did one of my sons, My other son smelled coconut, as did my fiance. My daughter shrugged and said it smelled like pina colada. No regrets on this purchase though!"

0,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",1.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t think this is legit.,"I LOVE this conditioner, it’s so good for my curly hair and works very well, that said what I received from my amazon subscribe and save order is NOT the conditioner I’ve been using.  This is the second bottle I’ve ordered, I noticed a difference in consistency when I gave my daughter the first bottle, but assumed they maybe changed the formula. I think this is counterfeit now with the second bottle after comparing, which  is disappointing, because a major factor in buying Pacifica products is that they are vegan and cruelty free, and with a counterfeit item you can pretty much guarantee that’s not the case.The left side of each photo is the bottle I just finished off, the right side is what was received from amazon.A) the bottles are very different, the amazon one looks and feels cheaply made, different graphic qualities too. Size is all wrong.B) the scent is not as strong and more vanilla with the amazon product, the product I normally buy has a strong fruity/pineapple scent.C) the consistency is SOOO different. The one I normally buy is thick and creamy, goes a long way. The one from amazon is thin like cheap conditioner."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Harsh conditioner negates the gentle shampoo,"(Reviewed as a set.) I love pineapple and wanted to love this product so much, I bought the set.  I have long, thick, curly, indigenous hair that tends to frizz; I'm also sensitive to scents, and lean toward natural products. SHAMPOO: Has a light, sweet, real-fruit smell that wants more depth, more power. It does not smell pina colada-y but I think I do get a whiff of banana (not my favorite). I imagine that scent is hard to balance in hair products; overall I like it. The lather is super thick with a nice, clean silky rinse and leaves my wet hair feeling clean and soft instead of stripped, with truly defined spiral curls. I can't detect any pineapple scent in my hair after rinsing. Feels nice, a good shampoo that is gentle enough to use often. However, I prefer washing 1x/week, so that's a little too gentle for me. But I liked it and was excited to try a conditioner that would amplify and continue that sweet, soft, curly feeling. It disappointed. CONDITIONER: Same scent, no issues. Feels light but strange and slick going on, and is actually too light/thin for thick hair. I had to use a lot of it, more than other conditioners, and had to press it into my hair to absorb-- it felt like a rebellious conditioner that didn't want to perform. It left the exact opposite feeling from the shampoo: greasy residue, not natural, ill-formulated, and drying. It clings to my hair, not in the way you want, so I had to rinse and rinse and rinse, negating the initial good shampoo. Pacifica products are not cheap in price, but are becoming more cheap in feel. My search for curly-hair cleansing products continues...."

The best feature is that it smells delicious. It's a thin conditioner and I can barely believe that it's intended for textured hair since it provides almost no moisture. This is best for straight, low porosity hair. It does nothing for my medium porosity, frizz prone wavy-curly hair. Maui Moisture has so many better options for a drug store brand. I also like the Garnier conditioners in the jars. They are silicone free as well!"

4,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Curly Hair,"In the past couple months I have learned the Curly Girl Method and I have been experimenting with some shampoos and conditioners. I really REALLY like this one a lot. It has a fruity smell that is a bit strong but not so strong to deter me (That is actually what worried me the most because I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to strong smells, and especially the ""exotic"" pineapple, banana, and such smells really make me keel over in the mornings). Initially, out of the bottle it is a bit strong but after washing it really isn't that strong, the smell of my shampoo is actually stronger. Anyways, sometimes I don't put in argon oil after showering to help keep my curls and I notice that with this conditioner, without the oil, it still helps keeps my curls nice. They are softer and a little looser without the oil or styler but it works great and I have been getting lots of compliments!"

I have fine 2b high porosity hair (the kind that gets super frizzy in a little bit of humidity). I've used a tonne of products and this is def one of my all time favourites. It's alot like wavemaker and cantu - and I only use a peasized amount of it. Gives some volume (but doesn't make your hair feel weighed down or full of product). I don't really need to layer products with this but if I really want to, I add a spritz of the b&b invisible oil primer or homemade salt spray!"
6,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly light and long-lasting,"Love this stuff. It smells light and natural. I use a small pea sized amount for my shoulder length hair if I am pulling it back, and about twice that much if I am wearing it down. It defines the curls and keeps the frizzies down. It doesn't coat my hands, washes off easily, and doesn't weigh my hair down with heavy/waxy stuff like some products do. This small tube lasts a long time, too."

For the last 10 years or so I've been using DevaCurl, and I've rarely tried anything else.  I've been using 10-14 pumps of conditoner every day. I really overdid it the first time I tried Pineapple Curls and I was am still stunned that a small palmful coats and detangles all my hair! It's like I can't use a small enough amount!  I was worried that a 10 oz. tube would last me a week, but this conditioner is so concentrated, my daughter and I are both using it and it's lasting for weeks! This is my new favorite conditioner.  This does not weight my hair down in the least - instead it makes my curls spring and bounce.  I have 2c-3b (mostly 3a) low porosity, coarse curls. I wish I'd found this conditioner a long time ago! I am crazy about the smell...like vacation on Maui!"

Bigger bottle please,Hi I have 3c curly hair and its bleach blonde and I been looking for something to replace my Cantu curl cream activator that I love but it's getting harder to find so I tried this curl defining cream and I really like it. My curls are shiny and  bouncy I do use a gel after nut I like it alot. I will say my only complaint is for 13 bucks I wish the bottle was bigger.

I've been using curly girl approved products and building up my waves for about a year now and after one use of this conditioner my hair was straighter than before I started. I tried clarifying my hair and giving it another shot, but got the same results.The consistency of this product does seem strange, as other reviews stated. It's VERY watery, but I've never used it before so it's possible that this is normal and not the result of tampering.All in all, it makes my hair very soft and smooth, but I wouldn't recommend for wavy hair."
11,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,I loved this until..,"So I have been having issues with allergies. My old cowash and conditioner started making me break out in hives (yikes) so I switched to a new cowash and this conditioner. I personally love this brand and had never used their hair products.The conditioner, while called pineapple, to me smells just like banana runts. I really loved it. Made my hair soft and made the wave and curl in my hair pop.Unfortunately, I started to have issues where everytime I used it, it made my head itch terribly. When I compared it to the other stuff I had issues with, I found an ingredient that they shared. So when looking for something new, I spent a lot of time to find something without that ingredient.Do highly recommend it though! Wish I could still use it."

It is much more watery - not the nice thick cream it normally is. I also noticed there was an ingredient sticker placed over the ingredients on the bottle. I checked the reviews to see if others had noticed anything different and sure enough some had and at least one person also had the sticker over the ingredients. I requested a refund and I am going to buy this one in store from now on. What a bummer because subscribe-and-save is so convenient.

I really wanted to like it because the packaging is so cute and many said the smell was great. To me the scent is nice but not as strong as say Cantu. I am using it mixed with Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus smoothie because that was too moisturizing lol so mixed together they work great. I am still searching for a replacement for the Devs Curl wavaker. This ain't it. For reference, I have thin, low density, medium porosity, 2C-3A hair."

I have thick hair & we have a lot of minerals in our water."

Looks awesome every time."

It'll run out way before the shampoo with the amount needed for it to somewhat work as conditioner. Even then, I don't think it's worth even using it.Conclusion:I absolutely recommend the shampoo, and I'll continue to use it. The conditioner may wind up in the trash. :("

I have pretty tight curls. My hair is THIIIRRRRSSSTTTY so it desires moisture and my hair is average (not too thick or too thin)With this description, I’d like to tell you that my hair loved this product. It smells delicious, it works fabulous as a leave in but it is a tad runny so I used a lot. I think I used it 4 times and it’s gone. I’m going to buy it again because it made my hair bouncy, light and it looked moisturized."

I bought it again and now it is very thin and even a bit foamy and it's like I didn't use conditioner at all.  I suspect this was a return that someone added water or something to.  To test that theory, I attempted a return and lo and behold they do allow returns.  I'm just throwing it....obviously Amazon is selling USED toiletries as NEW."

I’ve been working to encourage and develop it. I took a shot on this set, and wish I hadn’t. It made my hair so silky, that it doesn’t hold any texture at all. The pictures are my hair after the first wash with this set vs. it’s natural air dried wave. I don’t know how they market this as a product to help waves and curls. I’m just going to use it on my little girls straight hair and go back to Shea Moisture."

I layer this with a gel on soaking wet hair and it really helps define and clump. I would say it definitely needs a gel or a mousse because it has little to no hold.

21,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not greasy, leaves hair feeling soft <3",Easily one of the best products I've ever used (33y). I've spent a lot of my life looking for a product that wouldn't leave my hair hard as wax or greasy. I think I've finally found a product to stick with. I just hope irony doesn't rear its ugly head and then the place goes out of business leaving me searching for another 20 years.

I have 2c/3b hair texture w some loose curls here & there, Since I live in a hot humid area I’m always struggling w frizz & lack of definition. When using this mask I notice my hair seems more juicy & defined, & it smells great. Doesn’t feel heavy but it’s not light either(does that make sense?) but it provides enough moisture. I do find I need to use conditioner to be able to distribute it though out, as soon as it’s on, it feels very rich. works great so far. I would deff recommend to somebody who needs a little hydration boost."

It smells so good, like a yummy tropical vacation. I like the ingredients, I like that it doesn't have silicones. The best part of this conditioner is how lightweight it is, yet it actually detangles my hair. I have naturally wavy and very tangly hair and I always comb through it after putting conditioner in. This passes the comb-through test. A lot of other conditioners are just heavy, but don't actually detangle. This one detangles, makes my hair super soft and shiny after rinsing, enhances my natural wavy texture, and smells amazing. I will definitely be ordering more!!!!!"
24,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,My hair surprisingly loves this product,"I have 3c hair (confused on my exact porosity) and this is the only product I have been happy with after experimenting with other leave ins and oils for about a year. My hair loves moisture and it was difficult to find a leave in that wouldn't dry so quickly. What i really liked about this leave in was that I only needed water to refresh my curls after a while. Usually I have to redo my curls all together (re add random leave in, add water, try not to cry and get frustrated lol)  throughout the day and other products tend to make my hair stiff and dry so I try to find moisture combinations that work. I wasn't afraid to use this everyday and that says a lot.  I also noticed less shedding with this cream. I thought it was because I was taking better care of my hair in general, but when I ran out of Pacifica and started using not so good cheap products, my hair started to shed a lot again. This is the only product I feel like my hair is safe with for now! I literally just ordered my second bottle and the new curl pomade. My hair can't deal with the mess of gels and oils and random leave ins any longer. My only complaints are that I wish the bottle was bigger and the smell lasted longer. I think less is more because I have to make sure I spread the cream throughout my hair and use a little more water and oil combinations and then my hair is nice and soft and surprisingly bouncy. If your hair has a love-hate relationship with protein, then use less and make sure it's spread out evenly! (It contains coconut oil) It's meant to be a lightweight product, I just got carried away because I literally love this product lol. My hair is strange to me. As someone with fine curly wavyish strands but high volume ""ethnic"" hair, the right amount goes a long way.  I used way more than other reviews said because my hair loves the moisture. I was low-key surprised this worked on my hair type lol. It made my hair routine more enjoyable. Instead of redoing my hair when I want to refresh my curls now all I do is add water and maybe an oil to seal but this cream contains oil and leaves my scalp soft and massageable lol. I'm so wary of products that claim to be vegan and silicone free but this formula is what I needed so far."
25,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my dry curls,"I have super dry, curly, fine hair. I've basically been searching for balanced products my entire life. I had purchased Pacifica's lilac lotion, and knew their quality, so I took a gamble on the conditioner. Although pineapple is my favorite fruit, I must say this smells a little too sickly sweet for me (like right before a pineapple is about to go). That aside, OH MY GOD, it's the creamiest, non-greasy, buttery conditioner I have ever used! I LOVE how my curls feel and look, and the great news is that the scent mostly disappears after you rinse it out. Once my hair is dry I hardly notice the pineapple at all. I paid less than $5 here for my 8 oz. tube, and feel like I got a great bargain. The curls are shiny, bouncy, and my hair is SO soft. It's a winner!"
26,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Watery and not great quality - my heart is broken,"I bought this before and liked it before I learned about hair types and what good conditioners are supposed to feel like. Recently purchased again and was sad to find how terrible this product actually is.It’s very watery, which means you’ll go through the bottle quickly. Even with more product, it never actually seems to coat the hair, and does virtually nothing to detangle or give your hair any softness or silkiness.The scent is quite  strong for being one of the last ingredients. It’s a mix of pineapple and coconut, so if you’re looking to smell like an island (or a cocktail), look no further!But sadly, I’ve found better cheaper conditioners with more for my money at any drugstore.No hard feelings, Pineapple Curls. I really wanted to love you."
27,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing but not a thick conditioner,"My hair is low porosity, 3b, medium density, caucasian. My hair is weighed down easily so I like this light conditioner... it allows me to be more heavy handed with styling products, which I like. The consistency of this conditioner is rather thin and it takes a lot of product to feel like my hair is coated. And I have short hair. I like hyaluronic acid for my skin and hair, and I appreciate the curl-friendly, cruelty free ingredients. Beforehand I use a cowash or shampoo. After I rinse out the Pineapple Curls I put in leave-in conditioner. If your hair is thick or coarse in any way, you won't be satisfied with this. I can't image a lot of curly girls loving this, but if you have waves or loose curls this would be great for you."

I think it works best layered with an oil for moisture and shine as it is very lightweight. I’ve used better creams for my thin porous 3C hair, like Curls Blueberry line, but this one is almost as good, and definitely will be someone’s favorite. It has a great scent that my boyfriend is addicted to."

My daughter has thick curly hair and I am unable to run a comb or brush through her hair even with the conditioner still in.

240,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT FOR KINKY/COILY HAIR!,"My hair was completely detangled and knit-free at the beginning of the washing process. After using the matching shampoo without issue, I applied this conditioner and the nightmare began. As soon as I squeezed the product through my tresses, I realized that there was a huge problem. My hair was no longer tangle-free. In fact I couldn't run my fingers through it at all. The hair was instantly deeply matted. It took 10 hours (over the span of 3 days....thank you God for the miracle of telecommuting....) to work out the tangled mess, cutting quite a bit along the way. And after all of that, I still couldn't free the last 15% and had to cut it down.I almost never leave reviews, but I had to try to help even 1 fellow Curly. IF YOU HAVE TYPE 4 COILS, THIS IS NOT YOUR PRODUCT!!! The attached picture is about 25% of what I lost (Bottle cap for scale).Curlfriend, just don't do it."
241,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",4.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t be without it.,"I am a long time user of just about every Pacifica product and have never been disappointed.  My hair is healthy chest level length and colored bright red. I have a mix of small banana curls, waves, stretched out curls and a few straight pieces mixed in. with NY weather any day could be an unruly or a frizz day. And I hate gel and hair spray. I keep things natural. Icurrently use the sea salt wave cream and I love it but I wanted just a touch more of a “molded hold”.  It keeps my hair soft bouncy and I truly look like so just left the beach. This pineapple cream great and is a little thicker and has a Nice hold to it which does make Are my hair a little crunchy.  I mix the two and its perfect. Just what I want a nice full fluff with a touch of hold that isn’t sticky or stiff and they both smell delicious. I Will be buying stock in them both before they discontinue any thing."

Most curl creams I’ve tried either weighed my hair down or made my ends look dry. I have very sensitive skin so I am picky what goes on my hair. I used about a tablespoon of this with a denman brush and got the softest, shiniest, thickest wave/curl clumps I’ve ever had. I went out in 110* heat a few hours later and minimal frizz. I am very  happy and will definitely be using this every wash day. I wish they had a pineapple gel."

It should just be more clear…This would be great for fine hair.I am writing this so others avoid my mistake."

268,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful hair product, but needs a seal","Nice product for hair with a lovely scent and free of harsh chemicals and vegan. However, the the containers are NOT sealed. Why make such a nice product and not put a simple piece of foil or plastic? The lid came off during shipping from Amazon in their usual thin plastic one-day mailers and it spilled out all over three other items that I purchased. Please make products with a seal. That way people know that they’re getting the product that is supposed to be in the container, as packed from the manufacturer, and it’s more hygienic feeling to open a sealed product, and it doesn’t spill out all over everything resulting in product loss when shipped. Kudos to great products—Keep making wonderful products! I love all of the unique options, scents, and safer ingredients. Packaging is beautiful."

It is too lightweight to help get the tangled out, unlike thicker conditioners. This is a problem for thick curly hair."
270,"Pacifica Beauty Pineapple Curls Pomade| Hyaluronic Acid | For Curly and Textured Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate, Silicone + Paraben Free",5.0 out of 5 stars,better than expected,"first i will disclose i used the matching shampoo and conditioner first. When my hair was still damp after my shower, I put this cream in and scrunched a bit. then I twisted it on top of my head and slept on it. When I woke up the next morning my hair was barely damp, but so soft and curly. I brushed through my hair with my fingers, scrunched a bit and went out the door (after coffee of course) I have gotten so many comments at work. The scent does fade, you won't smell like pineapple all day. The scent is actually up in the air. When the package first came I had everyone in my family smell. I smelled pineapple and so did one of my sons, My other son smelled coconut, as did my fiance. My daughter shrugged and said it smelled like pina colada. No regrets on this purchase though!"

It doesn’t dry out my hair. However, the conditioner is so watered down that my poor curls were so damaged from using it. I also have the leave in conditioner, but it does no justice for me either. It dried out my hair and leaves a heavy mousse sticky feel to my clean hair. I would continue to use the shampoo only. For reference, I have really fine wavy-curly hair"

0,Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing Shampoo + Salty Waves Texturizing Conditioner | For All Hair Types | Perfect and Effortless Beach Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Adds body and texture to fine, limp hair when used occasionally","I love Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Shampoo and Conditioner.  I first purchased it at Target and then found it here on Amazon for half the price.  I have fine, soft, long hair and lots of it.  I have difficulty finding products to ""lift"" my hair at the root and help it to look more full.  When my hair starts to get too soft or conditioned, I use this product for a couple of days and it really helps bring back the volume and bounce.  If I used it every day, it becomes harsh and over texturizes my hair leaving it dull and and rough.  So...know that this is a great once-a-week shampoo/conditioner but overuse may cause you to say goodbye to the product."
1,Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing Shampoo + Salty Waves Texturizing Conditioner | For All Hair Types | Perfect and Effortless Beach Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate + Paraben Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Surfer Waves not happening...,So if you are looking for a shampoo that will help give your hair texture or enhance your natural waves or curls this is not the shampoo for you. I have naturally wavy hair and even air drying this shampoo gives me super soft FLAT hair. No texture. No nothing. I used with the conditioner and the hair balm from the liner as well.  Smells good and leaves hair clean and soft but that is it.
2,Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing Shampoo + Salty Waves Texturizing Conditioner | For All Hair Types | Perfect and Effortless Beach Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate + Paraben Free,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Like the Cheapest of Candies,"This product smells exactly like those pastel-orange candies called ""circus peanuts"".If memory serves, they were kind of chewy, marshmallowy, and sickly sweet -- just like they smelled. If you're not familiar with them, someone mentioned artificial banana, and I think that's close. They were 99 cents a bag when I was a kid, & when you're a kid & money is tight, even cheap, crappy candy is better than no candy at all.Which brings me back to these products. I bought this shampoo & conditioner b/c after a month of stay-at-home orders, I was desperate for a little beach in my life. Sadly, unlike circus peanuts,  these products did not deliver. At the end of the day, sugar is sugar (at least when you're seven), but unless you are accustomed to eating cheap candy at the beach, there is zero relationship between these products' fragrance and any of the odors I associate with a trip to the ocean.I understand that it contains sea-derived ingredients, & perhaps that's how they derived the name, but it's still misleading.As for the products' shampooing/conditioning powers -- they are equally unimpressive. Particularly if you have hair that's prone to frizz (as I do).Oh, and it bears mentioning that the seam on the shampoo squeezie container broke on my second use.In sum, if you are looking for a fragrance that will remind you of pleasant days spent at the beach, this is not it. However, if you're looking to reminisce about the days when you could stuff your face with the cheapest of candies and still think yourself happy, this may be the product for you."
3,Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing Shampoo + Salty Waves Texturizing Conditioner | For All Hair Types | Perfect and Effortless Beach Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate + Paraben Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Would advise against it,I was really disappointed with this product. I followed the directions and even used the conditioner and texturizing spray. My hair did not look any different and it dried my hair out a lot. I thought is it just my hair type but my friend who has really curly/wavy hair tried it and she felt the same. The worst part about this product is the scent. It was nauseating.
4,Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing Shampoo + Salty Waves Texturizing Conditioner | For All Hair Types | Perfect and Effortless Beach Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely Banana Scent.  Leaves hair healthy!,"I quite love this conditioner, but I do not find it particularly enhances my wavy hair.  However, it has a yummy sweet banana scent and (more importantly) conditions my hair very well.  I don't find my hair any curlier/wavier after using it, but I do find it in particularly healthy condition.  The results are soft, quite shiny, with good body, smooth and easy to style.  It's a slightly thick conditioner, I find I use a generous amount to get it fully distributed.I generally purchase salon conditioners (I rarely find a drug store one I truly like), and I have fine, thick-ish, wavy hair that tends to be dry (and has a very closed low porosity cuticle).  My hair loves protein, and this has enough to content my hair.With any product described as ""Salty,"" I have the concern the results will be either dry or tangly, but no product in this line produces any sort of dryness or tangliness; they all leave hair well-controlled soft, and shiny.  I'll be interested in retrying the balm and salt spray in the summer, as I think they may give more wave in warm humid weather and seem suited for air drying.  But, in the meantime, I quite love the shampoo and conditioner."

6,Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing Shampoo + Salty Waves Texturizing Conditioner | For All Hair Types | Perfect and Effortless Beach Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy hair with texture!,"This is my new favorite conditioner- I'm on my fourth bottle! A little goes a long way. I have thick, wavy/curly hair that I love already but this takes it to another level. People I've known a long time have stopped me and told me how amazing my hair is looking in color and waves. I use a wrap curling iron to put a little more wave into parts of it and the conditioner helps hold that look in place really well and gives it a volume boost while still maintaining natural and healthy hair."
7,Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing Shampoo + Salty Waves Texturizing Conditioner | For All Hair Types | Perfect and Effortless Beach Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,No texture or waves with this one!,So if you are looking for a conditioner that will help give your hair texture or enhance your natural waves or curls this is not the shampoo for you.

Naturally curly hair dislikes almost everything one does to it. This product gives texture and stabilizes the wild hair.

10,Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing Shampoo + Salty Waves Texturizing Conditioner | For All Hair Types | Perfect and Effortless Beach Hair | 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite conditioner so far,I love the way it feels like this conditioner actually soaks into my hair rather than just sitting on it.  It's lightweight and easy to rinse.  Smells amazing.  I have long hair and am impressed with how long it has lasted me.  Will be buying again.  I get heavy highlights regularly and I also swim several times a week in a chlorinated pool.  Really liking this product for my hair.

After further use, I found that it didn't give my hair the extra hold that it's oily cousins gave your hair.  Also, it has a pretty awful odor."

0,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Adds body and texture to fine, limp hair when used occasionally","I love Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Shampoo and Conditioner.  I first purchased it at Target and then found it here on Amazon for half the price.  I have fine, soft, long hair and lots of it.  I have difficulty finding products to ""lift"" my hair at the root and help it to look more full.  When my hair starts to get too soft or conditioned, I use this product for a couple of days and it really helps bring back the volume and bounce.  If I used it every day, it becomes harsh and over texturizes my hair leaving it dull and and rough.  So...know that this is a great once-a-week shampoo/conditioner but overuse may cause you to say goodbye to the product."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Surfer Waves not happening...,So if you are looking for a shampoo that will help give your hair texture or enhance your natural waves or curls this is not the shampoo for you. I have naturally wavy hair and even air drying this shampoo gives me super soft FLAT hair. No texture. No nothing. I used with the conditioner and the hair balm from the liner as well.  Smells good and leaves hair clean and soft but that is it.
2,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Like the Cheapest of Candies,"This product smells exactly like those pastel-orange candies called ""circus peanuts"".If memory serves, they were kind of chewy, marshmallowy, and sickly sweet -- just like they smelled. If you're not familiar with them, someone mentioned artificial banana, and I think that's close. They were 99 cents a bag when I was a kid, & when you're a kid & money is tight, even cheap, crappy candy is better than no candy at all.Which brings me back to these products. I bought this shampoo & conditioner b/c after a month of stay-at-home orders, I was desperate for a little beach in my life. Sadly, unlike circus peanuts,  these products did not deliver. At the end of the day, sugar is sugar (at least when you're seven), but unless you are accustomed to eating cheap candy at the beach, there is zero relationship between these products' fragrance and any of the odors I associate with a trip to the ocean.I understand that it contains sea-derived ingredients, & perhaps that's how they derived the name, but it's still misleading.As for the products' shampooing/conditioning powers -- they are equally unimpressive. Particularly if you have hair that's prone to frizz (as I do).Oh, and it bears mentioning that the seam on the shampoo squeezie container broke on my second use.In sum, if you are looking for a fragrance that will remind you of pleasant days spent at the beach, this is not it. However, if you're looking to reminisce about the days when you could stuff your face with the cheapest of candies and still think yourself happy, this may be the product for you."
3,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Would advise against it,I was really disappointed with this product. I followed the directions and even used the conditioner and texturizing spray. My hair did not look any different and it dried my hair out a lot. I thought is it just my hair type but my friend who has really curly/wavy hair tried it and she felt the same. The worst part about this product is the scent. It was nauseating.
4,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely Banana Scent.  Leaves hair healthy!,"I quite love this conditioner, but I do not find it particularly enhances my wavy hair.  However, it has a yummy sweet banana scent and (more importantly) conditions my hair very well.  I don't find my hair any curlier/wavier after using it, but I do find it in particularly healthy condition.  The results are soft, quite shiny, with good body, smooth and easy to style.  It's a slightly thick conditioner, I find I use a generous amount to get it fully distributed.I generally purchase salon conditioners (I rarely find a drug store one I truly like), and I have fine, thick-ish, wavy hair that tends to be dry (and has a very closed low porosity cuticle).  My hair loves protein, and this has enough to content my hair.With any product described as ""Salty,"" I have the concern the results will be either dry or tangly, but no product in this line produces any sort of dryness or tangliness; they all leave hair well-controlled soft, and shiny.  I'll be interested in retrying the balm and salt spray in the summer, as I think they may give more wave in warm humid weather and seem suited for air drying.  But, in the meantime, I quite love the shampoo and conditioner."
5,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"So-so...not bad, but not special","it's ok. basically, it's shampoo. i didn't notice anything special about it.it isn't bad, but it isn't especially amazing. i didn't notice it making my hair more or less wavy or curly.this isn't a product placement, but for my money, Sun Bum makes a curling shampoo that DOES put a noticeable wave in your hair--and it's also $9.99, so i'll be doing that from now on.this shampoo DOES smell nice, that's for sure."
6,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy hair with texture!,"This is my new favorite conditioner- I'm on my fourth bottle! A little goes a long way. I have thick, wavy/curly hair that I love already but this takes it to another level. People I've known a long time have stopped me and told me how amazing my hair is looking in color and waves. I use a wrap curling iron to put a little more wave into parts of it and the conditioner helps hold that look in place really well and gives it a volume boost while still maintaining natural and healthy hair."
7,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,No texture or waves with this one!,So if you are looking for a conditioner that will help give your hair texture or enhance your natural waves or curls this is not the shampoo for you.

9,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t control frizz,"I love this stuff! Naturally curly hair dislikes almost everything one does to it. This product gives texture and stabilizes the wild hair. However, it does not help with frizz, I add a few drops of coconut oil to counter this."
10,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Hydrating and Texturizing Shampoo, Revives Dry, Damaged Hair, Vegan and Cruelty Free, 12 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite conditioner so far,I love the way it feels like this conditioner actually soaks into my hair rather than just sitting on it.  It's lightweight and easy to rinse.  Smells amazing.  I have long hair and am impressed with how long it has lasted me.  Will be buying again.  I get heavy highlights regularly and I also swim several times a week in a chlorinated pool.  Really liking this product for my hair.

After further use, I found that it didn't give my hair the extra hold that it's oily cousins gave your hair.  Also, it has a pretty awful odor."

0,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing and Moisturizing Conditioner, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 8 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Adds body and texture to fine, limp hair when used occasionally","I love Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Shampoo and Conditioner.  I first purchased it at Target and then found it here on Amazon for half the price.  I have fine, soft, long hair and lots of it.  I have difficulty finding products to ""lift"" my hair at the root and help it to look more full.  When my hair starts to get too soft or conditioned, I use this product for a couple of days and it really helps bring back the volume and bounce.  If I used it every day, it becomes harsh and over texturizes my hair leaving it dull and and rough.  So...know that this is a great once-a-week shampoo/conditioner but overuse may cause you to say goodbye to the product."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing and Moisturizing Conditioner, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 8 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Surfer Waves not happening...,So if you are looking for a shampoo that will help give your hair texture or enhance your natural waves or curls this is not the shampoo for you. I have naturally wavy hair and even air drying this shampoo gives me super soft FLAT hair. No texture. No nothing. I used with the conditioner and the hair balm from the liner as well.  Smells good and leaves hair clean and soft but that is it.
2,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing and Moisturizing Conditioner, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 8 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Like the Cheapest of Candies,"This product smells exactly like those pastel-orange candies called ""circus peanuts"".If memory serves, they were kind of chewy, marshmallowy, and sickly sweet -- just like they smelled. If you're not familiar with them, someone mentioned artificial banana, and I think that's close. They were 99 cents a bag when I was a kid, & when you're a kid & money is tight, even cheap, crappy candy is better than no candy at all.Which brings me back to these products. I bought this shampoo & conditioner b/c after a month of stay-at-home orders, I was desperate for a little beach in my life. Sadly, unlike circus peanuts,  these products did not deliver. At the end of the day, sugar is sugar (at least when you're seven), but unless you are accustomed to eating cheap candy at the beach, there is zero relationship between these products' fragrance and any of the odors I associate with a trip to the ocean.I understand that it contains sea-derived ingredients, & perhaps that's how they derived the name, but it's still misleading.As for the products' shampooing/conditioning powers -- they are equally unimpressive. Particularly if you have hair that's prone to frizz (as I do).Oh, and it bears mentioning that the seam on the shampoo squeezie container broke on my second use.In sum, if you are looking for a fragrance that will remind you of pleasant days spent at the beach, this is not it. However, if you're looking to reminisce about the days when you could stuff your face with the cheapest of candies and still think yourself happy, this may be the product for you."
3,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing and Moisturizing Conditioner, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 8 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Would advise against it,I was really disappointed with this product. I followed the directions and even used the conditioner and texturizing spray. My hair did not look any different and it dried my hair out a lot. I thought is it just my hair type but my friend who has really curly/wavy hair tried it and she felt the same. The worst part about this product is the scent. It was nauseating.
4,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing and Moisturizing Conditioner, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 8 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely Banana Scent.  Leaves hair healthy!,"I quite love this conditioner, but I do not find it particularly enhances my wavy hair.  However, it has a yummy sweet banana scent and (more importantly) conditions my hair very well.  I don't find my hair any curlier/wavier after using it, but I do find it in particularly healthy condition.  The results are soft, quite shiny, with good body, smooth and easy to style.  It's a slightly thick conditioner, I find I use a generous amount to get it fully distributed.I generally purchase salon conditioners (I rarely find a drug store one I truly like), and I have fine, thick-ish, wavy hair that tends to be dry (and has a very closed low porosity cuticle).  My hair loves protein, and this has enough to content my hair.With any product described as ""Salty,"" I have the concern the results will be either dry or tangly, but no product in this line produces any sort of dryness or tangliness; they all leave hair well-controlled soft, and shiny.  I'll be interested in retrying the balm and salt spray in the summer, as I think they may give more wave in warm humid weather and seem suited for air drying.  But, in the meantime, I quite love the shampoo and conditioner."
5,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing and Moisturizing Conditioner, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 8 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"So-so...not bad, but not special","it's ok. basically, it's shampoo. i didn't notice anything special about it.it isn't bad, but it isn't especially amazing. i didn't notice it making my hair more or less wavy or curly.this isn't a product placement, but for my money, Sun Bum makes a curling shampoo that DOES put a noticeable wave in your hair--and it's also $9.99, so i'll be doing that from now on.this shampoo DOES smell nice, that's for sure."
6,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing and Moisturizing Conditioner, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 8 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy hair with texture!,"This is my new favorite conditioner- I'm on my fourth bottle! A little goes a long way. I have thick, wavy/curly hair that I love already but this takes it to another level. People I've known a long time have stopped me and told me how amazing my hair is looking in color and waves. I use a wrap curling iron to put a little more wave into parts of it and the conditioner helps hold that look in place really well and gives it a volume boost while still maintaining natural and healthy hair."

10,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texturizing and Moisturizing Conditioner, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 8 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite conditioner so far,I love the way it feels like this conditioner actually soaks into my hair rather than just sitting on it.  It's lightweight and easy to rinse.  Smells amazing.  I have long hair and am impressed with how long it has lasted me.  Will be buying again.  I get heavy highlights regularly and I also swim several times a week in a chlorinated pool.  Really liking this product for my hair.

0,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just what I was looking for. Definition, separation and smoothing for mermaid hair!","Fantastic. Provides hydration, smoothing, separation of curl clumps and definition. I have 2b-2c low porosity hair and was looking for definition and texture. Gives just that. Though if your are looking for beachy waves/tousled, it’d be best to use a beach spray, which I use for volume occasionally. Smell is light, which is great if you layer products.  I will use this product every wash day for as long as it’s available! Love it!I use it on wash day after shampoo, conditioner and leave in. Apply gel afterwards to hold the curls till next wash day. On 2-3 day hair I put a dime sized amount in my palm and a splash of water and gently smooth over the canopy of my hair. Curls come back to life, frizzies calm down and mermaid hair comes back! The protein in this works to spring the curl back up."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,I want to order more!!,"I was a little hesitant about buying this after reading reviews. I have VERY thick course hair, that's also curly when wet but dries straight and frizzy. Most of the reviews weren't very good, but I took the chance. I washed my hair and put this on after I towel dried it. The smell was heavy of bananas but with a tropical twist. It came out a little thich, but went over my hair very nicely. Though I used more than I should have, like 2 quarter size bits. I had my daughter put dutch braids in my hair and left them in for well over 12 hours. I got home the next morning after work took my hair down and my hair was actually wavy and so soft to the touch. I've now been using this for over a week and I gotta say I absolutely love it. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star is because it does give it a lot of volume, which I already have enough of. I'm not sure why everyone is saying they smell like a big banana, because I certainly don't. I guess the smell of my shampoo and conditioner is just as strong so I don't smell what everyone else does. I have also used this on my hair while it's been dry and it does give it a more textured look to it.UPDATE: using this products for 2 weeks now. I have decreased the size amount that I am using because it did way down my hair. I have been using it after I get out of the shower on my towle dried hair. I put maybe a dime size amount in my pamls and work it through root to ends. My hair is still drying straight but still not frizzy, but yet this does not give me beachy waves. Still my hair is soft. IDK if I want to try and return it or not."
2,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Love Pacifica,"I Love Pacifica’s products so I wanted to give this a try. It does what it claims and the good thing is you can use it on wet or dry hair. I have dry hair so I do use this on my dry hair and it makes your hair soft and kind of  textured. The reason I gave four stars instead of five is because it said it has a banana scent and it doesn’t , it does have a scent but it very hard to smell. Which some people will love, but because it is a beach product I was hoping for a nice smell. It’s possible it just has set on the shelf for a while."
3,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,works great,"I have naturally curly frizzy hair. This product works wonders on my hair.

I have pretty standard hair - not too thick or thin - and rarely use heat on it."
7,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,Love this. I have fine hair and use this on towel dried hair. Then blow dry and my hair is wavy but not sticky. I also use it on dry hair. Love it. Worth the price
8,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,OK Product,I was looking for a product to replace NYM Beach Babe Texturizing Hair (which apparently they have stopped making.)  I was leery about the scent but it is pleasant and not overpowering.  Light texturizing but not the beachy texture I wanted. This product does not provide the bite/hold I was looking for.  I love that it is vegan and does not contain chemicals.
9,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Pacifica hair products!,I use this dry on my wavy curly hair. I need it to provide moisture and to fluff and refresh my hair on days I don't wash. Only a small amount is necessary. I love Pacifica products for my hair. I also use the coconut shampoo and salty waves conditioner (which does not have salt). The girl who was doing my foil highlights asked me what I used. She said my hair was in good condition!

11,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Is it really salty waves?,I can't ever tell if my hair is barely waving because of it's own little kinky quirks or because I put Salty Waves in it. There is ZERO hold to speak of and this MUST be used in tandem with another product if you want any results to occur in your hair. I found it to be a waste of my money
12,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this brand!,My hair has been getting softer over time and more manageable.

55,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad Smelling Product,Normally a great product but this one smells terrible. We contacted the company directly but they refused to replace the product since it was purchased on Amazon. Terrible customer service and we are no longer a customer. Buyer be ware.
56,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Beach Hair Styling Balm, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice and smoothing,"I like this and use it after every hair wash. My hair gets frizzy if I don't use a product in it, and this one does a great job."
0,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Yuck,"To start, I LOVE Pacifica. It's cruelty free and their products are natural and usually great. I've tried several sprays for waves (my hair is thick and curly/wavy). My favorite is Alterna's so far. The result of this spray is just like putting really salty water on your hair- it doesn't cause waves, it just causes really dry, salty hair. I really appreciate that Amazon refunded this so easily."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff,"This stuff is amazing. If you want texture and hair that has body, you need this. I have straight, thin hair and this is the only thing that gives me lift."
2,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beach party in a bottle!,"This product delivers beautiful waves and texture. I have a lot of hair, but it is slippery and fine. Beauty Salty Waves delivers both volume and texture, reminding me of the lovely days of my youth spent on Oahu, cliff diving at the Point and body surfing at Sandy Beach. A couple spritzes delivers an instant, care-free vibe. It’s a beach party in a bottle!"
3,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Quite Right for My Hair,"I have very frizzy, curly, unruly curls, so my hairdresser suggested I try sea salt spray.  I tried the Captain Blankenship Mermaid product and I loved it, but I thought it was a little pricey. The next time around, I thought I would try something else.  Pacifica makes good products, and I have liked everything I've bought from them in the past.  Their products are always cruelty free and vegan friendly, which appeals to me very much.  I tried this particular product, and although it smells nice and is gentle, it just didn't give my curls enough definition.  Might work better for someone else.  I am going back to the Mermaid product, though."
4,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't seem to work with fine hair,I thought this might add some texture to my fine hair.  I tried this a couple times varying the amount of product I used.  This seemed to weigh down my hair and make it look almost greasy.  I do have very fine hair though.
5,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes me feel like a sexy beach goddess,"Although this is pretty much just salt and water with some fragrances added, I love it!It works and leaves my hair smelling nice.

6,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,I really like this spray! I tried it on we and dry hair. Dry hair it doesn't work too well for me but in damp hair it's amazing. It really brings out my natural waves. I would definatly buy this again

9,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work,I was so disappointed when I used this and it didn't work because of all the great reviews. This spray does nothing but kind of knot ur hair and make it extremely frizzy. I don't have frizzy hair. I used it for the first time last night on damp hair as it says and it added no wave or anything. Just knotted and frizzy and leaves urnhair feeling GROSS. I can't even get a brush through it right now. Horrible product. Do not buy this. The other reviews are wrong.
10,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Texture but frizzy,It smells great just give my hair volume and texture but you can definitely fill it in your hair and it tends to make it a bit frizzy and naughty so go lightly on it if you go light maybe on wash day it does good for spraying it on dry hair seem to just make my hair frizzy and sticky
11,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing and let's me rock my curls!,"This sea salt spray is amazing for my fine, curly hair!

45,"Pacifica Beauty Salty Waves Texture Spray, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Probably better for thin hair,"It didn't give my hair any texture. I have short, thick hair, so I wasn't expecting a huge difference but I was hoping for something that would at least add a bit of texture or volume. It does smell nice, though, and the scent lasts all day. It smells like a very light, fruity banana smell. I think this would probably work great for someone thin or fine hair"

It smelled good, it's clean, but whatever they put in it weighed down my hair and caused so much product buildup I had to go to a salon to get it out. It took 2 cleanses to get *most* of the product out. The hair stylist literally said it looked as though I hadn't washed my hair in 3 weeks when in reality I had been scrubbing for at least a week trying to get it out on my own. Now it could just be me and my hair, but I wouldn't risk it if I were you. This shampoo isn't that amazing. It just smells like coconut in the end.Original 5 star review:I bought this product along with the conditioner after finding out OGX had ingredients in it that when mixed with water create formaldehyde.I wanted something vegan and clean, something I could use and not worry if it'll give me a tumor 10 years down the road.The ingredient list is safe and the shampoo smells great! My hair is a little more greasy than normal but I think it's from switching products. It's definitely worth a shot!"
1,"Pacifica Beauty Coconut Power Strong & Long Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry + Damaged Hair, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Sulfate + Paraben Free, White, 2 Count",1.0 out of 5 stars,Watch out for silicone! False advertising!,"I originally bout this conditioner because it was the only one I could find that did not have silicone, mind you I bought it a little over a year ago. At that time it was hard to find a conditioner or shampoo that was free of silicones, sulfate free, and paraben free. I came to realize their ingredients is VERY different that what they are advertising here, and the 4th ingredient is dimethicone, which is silicone. Bad, bad, bad. Products with this in them dry the living hell out of my scalp and hair, I am very disappointed in Pacifica for falsely advertising to me.These days there are regular brands of shampoo and conditioner like Garnier and others that make silicone and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, you don’t have to search anymore and I will just look elsewhere."

So far after a week it's been working well, my hair is slightly damaged at the ends and oily at the roots, combining this with the banana mask has been working wonders on my hair.  Very satisfied and would highly recommend.  The added bonus of the smell is like a summer day at the beach everyday."
4,"Pacifica Beauty Coconut Power Strong & Long Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry + Damaged Hair, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Sulfate + Paraben Free, White, 2 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great shampoo, but faulty cap - shampoo leaked out.","Received replacement shampoo and used shampoo + conditioner today.I am VERY surprised at how smooth the two Pacifica products made my long, naturally curly/frizzy hair. I can't recall the last time my hair felt so soft, manageable and without that heavy feel. Both products rinsed out quickly, with minimal hair in the drain strainer.Normally alternate between Pantene, TRESemmé and L'Oreal Extraordinary Clay, since it's never a good idea to use the same shampoo / conditioner continuously.Of the four shampoos / conditioners listed, Pacifica Coconut Power Strong and Long, gave the best results. The L'Oreal is comparable to minimal hair in the drain, but the conditioner is extremely difficult to rinse out, even with the hard water we have.Hopefully, the results will always be this favorable, but at least for now, I found a very nice shampoo and conditioner, in Pacifica. The coconut scent is also very pleasant - not overwhelming.Why liquid items are not sealed properly is a mystery to me. Cap is defective (see image) and was delivered with shampoo leaking inside and outside of box.When the cap is in the CLOSED position, there is a gap on the opposite side of the opening, which was crystal clear after washing all the soap and dirt off the cap. The cap does not seal properly. When it's in the fully CLOSED position, the front of the cap opens. Leaked out of both ends.See attached image."
5,"Pacifica Beauty Coconut Power Strong & Long Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry + Damaged Hair, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Sulfate + Paraben Free, White, 2 Count",2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for my hair,"I really wanted to love this product since I'm trying to use better ingredients on my body and hair. I love that it's cruelty free and vegan, and I liked the smell too.Unfortunately, I wouldn't buy this again. I needed to use a lot to cover my long hair, there was very little lather, and it left my hair looking dull and greasy, while feeling dry at the same time. It was more expensive than any other shampoo I've used too. I guess I'll have to continue my search for a shampoo that works better for my hair."

My hair is silky and shiny for the first time in my life. I have been dying my hair for years, and this has helped it heal. I noticed it after the first wash. I am in love and will never go back."
7,"Pacifica Beauty Coconut Power Strong & Long Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry + Damaged Hair, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Sulfate + Paraben Free, White, 2 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost like therapy....,"I would marry this shampoo and conditioner if one could marry inanimate objects and polygamy wasn't illegal. My hair is very grateful for this purchase and happy hair means happy me. I just moved to an area with exceedingly hard water and my hair was starting to suffer greatly. Dull, dry, falling out and just plain depressing to deal with and look at. We were considering splitting and separating completely. Just one ""treatment session"" with this combination of therapists promises a brighter future for my hair and thus myself. Soothing and pleasant aromatherapy was added as a bonus, which puts it on another level. Hopefully, we will see continued improvement in the health and relationship between my hair and me."

Love Pacifica and wanted to give their hair care a try. I have fine hair and didn't think it detangled well (which I would expect from conditioner). Don't feel like it did the repair work it advertised. It's okay, but would not re-buy. Lots of other natural, cruelty-free conditioner options that work better."
9,"Pacifica Beauty Coconut Power Strong & Long Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry + Damaged Hair, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Sulfate + Paraben Free, White, 2 Count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have straight colored/highlighted hair. Although my hair is in pretty good condition, the ends tend to get a little more dry and unruly. I've tried lots of products to fix this problem. The best one is now no longer available. This conditioner from Pacifica is great though! It smells so nice with the coconut scent and it made my hair feel silky in the shower. It also helped my hair look better on the ends. Not 100% fixed, but much better. I liked it so much that I ordered the shampoo. Recommended."
10,"Pacifica Beauty Coconut Power Strong & Long Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry + Damaged Hair, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Sulfate + Paraben Free, White, 2 Count",4.0 out of 5 stars,I really want to like this,"I really want to like this conditioner.  It has all the stuff I want, Vegan and Cruelty free.  Plus it has a lot of the filler stuff you don't want in your hair.  It smells so good.  It has a nice weight to it.  But when I put it in my hair, it disappears.  It doesn't spread very well.  And then when I wash it out my hair feels so dry.  To be fair, I have extremely long hair, it's thickish, kind of curly, and mostly grey.  I have to put oil and other moisturizing products in my hair.  I have this on auto ship and will continue to work with it."

So runny!,"Awful! This shampoo is so thin and watery! I have to pour 3 big handfuls of shampoo every time I wash my hair because it does not lather up...just feels like wet hair. I have a short (less than shoulder length) style. For the price I paid for this shampoo I would expect much better quality. I have no idea how it got 4.5 stars. The smell is nice but even that seems diluted. My hair does not have that fresh, clean feeling and smell after washing it. I hate this shampoo!"

I was hoping for a very tropical scent but this is more neutral, which is fine. The scent does not linger anyways. I'm using this right now paired with the matching shampoo & am impressed. My hair feels clean, smooth & looks shiny. I'm really happy with this set & plan to keep using."

88,"Pacifica Beauty Coconut Power Strong & Long Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry + Damaged Hair, 100% Vegan & Cruelty Free, Sulfate + Paraben Free, White, 2 Count",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not real product,This most def not real product it is very thin compared to one’s bought at store or Pacifica. Also no foil seal which is always present in past purchases not on amazon. I enjoy amazon for fast free shipping but will never buy any more health and beauty items on amazon as I don’t trust if they are legitimate.

The only thing I don’t love is, my hair is pretty thick so it took a lot to cover it and the bottle didn’t last as long as I would have liked. It wasn’t too expensive so it wasn’t too big of a deal. I used it with the pineapple curls shampoo also from Pacifica and they seemed to work well together."

0,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't do it!!!!!!,"UPDATE 04/21/2021:God awful shampoo! It smelled good, it's clean, but whatever they put in it weighed down my hair and caused so much product buildup I had to go to a salon to get it out. It took 2 cleanses to get *most* of the product out. The hair stylist literally said it looked as though I hadn't washed my hair in 3 weeks when in reality I had been scrubbing for at least a week trying to get it out on my own. Now it could just be me and my hair, but I wouldn't risk it if I were you. This shampoo isn't that amazing. It just smells like coconut in the end.Original 5 star review:I bought this product along with the conditioner after finding out OGX had ingredients in it that when mixed with water create formaldehyde.I wanted something vegan and clean, something I could use and not worry if it'll give me a tumor 10 years down the road.The ingredient list is safe and the shampoo smells great! My hair is a little more greasy than normal but I think it's from switching products. It's definitely worth a shot!"
1,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",1.0 out of 5 stars,Watch out for silicone! False advertising!,"I originally bout this conditioner because it was the only one I could find that did not have silicone, mind you I bought it a little over a year ago. At that time it was hard to find a conditioner or shampoo that was free of silicones, sulfate free, and paraben free. I came to realize their ingredients is VERY different that what they are advertising here, and the 4th ingredient is dimethicone, which is silicone. Bad, bad, bad. Products with this in them dry the living hell out of my scalp and hair, I am very disappointed in Pacifica for falsely advertising to me.These days there are regular brands of shampoo and conditioner like Garnier and others that make silicone and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, you don’t have to search anymore and I will just look elsewhere."
2,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,I am SUPER allergic and everything makes me itch,"I am SUPER allergic and everything makes me itch. So far, I have been able to use Pacifica hair products with out having a reaction. They also work well on my curly hair."
3,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing with it weighing down,"I have been looking for an everyday conditioner that doesn't way my hair down, and keeps my curls moisturized.  So far after a week it's been working well, my hair is slightly damaged at the ends and oily at the roots, combining this with the banana mask has been working wonders on my hair.  Very satisfied and would highly recommend.  The added bonus of the smell is like a summer day at the beach everyday."
4,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great shampoo, but faulty cap - shampoo leaked out.","Received replacement shampoo and used shampoo + conditioner today.I am VERY surprised at how smooth the two Pacifica products made my long, naturally curly/frizzy hair. I can't recall the last time my hair felt so soft, manageable and without that heavy feel. Both products rinsed out quickly, with minimal hair in the drain strainer.Normally alternate between Pantene, TRESemmé and L'Oreal Extraordinary Clay, since it's never a good idea to use the same shampoo / conditioner continuously.Of the four shampoos / conditioners listed, Pacifica Coconut Power Strong and Long, gave the best results. The L'Oreal is comparable to minimal hair in the drain, but the conditioner is extremely difficult to rinse out, even with the hard water we have.Hopefully, the results will always be this favorable, but at least for now, I found a very nice shampoo and conditioner, in Pacifica. The coconut scent is also very pleasant - not overwhelming.Why liquid items are not sealed properly is a mystery to me. Cap is defective (see image) and was delivered with shampoo leaking inside and outside of box.When the cap is in the CLOSED position, there is a gap on the opposite side of the opening, which was crystal clear after washing all the soap and dirt off the cap. The cap does not seal properly. When it's in the fully CLOSED position, the front of the cap opens. Leaked out of both ends.See attached image."
5,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for my hair,"I really wanted to love this product since I'm trying to use better ingredients on my body and hair. I love that it's cruelty free and vegan, and I liked the smell too.Unfortunately, I wouldn't buy this again. I needed to use a lot to cover my long hair, there was very little lather, and it left my hair looking dull and greasy, while feeling dry at the same time. It was more expensive than any other shampoo I've used too. I guess I'll have to continue my search for a shampoo that works better for my hair."
6,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny and soft hair for the first time in my life.,"Hands down the best conditioner I've ever used. My hair is silky and shiny for the first time in my life. I have been dying my hair for years, and this has helped it heal. I noticed it after the first wash. I am in love and will never go back."
7,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost like therapy....,"I would marry this shampoo and conditioner if one could marry inanimate objects and polygamy wasn't illegal. My hair is very grateful for this purchase and happy hair means happy me. I just moved to an area with exceedingly hard water and my hair was starting to suffer greatly. Dull, dry, falling out and just plain depressing to deal with and look at. We were considering splitting and separating completely. Just one ""treatment session"" with this combination of therapists promises a brighter future for my hair and thus myself. Soothing and pleasant aromatherapy was added as a bonus, which puts it on another level. Hopefully, we will see continued improvement in the health and relationship between my hair and me."
8,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"Not my favorite. Love Pacifica and wanted to give their hair care a try. I have fine hair and didn't think it detangled well (which I would expect from conditioner). Don't feel like it did the repair work it advertised. It's okay, but would not re-buy. Lots of other natural, cruelty-free conditioner options that work better."
9,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have straight colored/highlighted hair. Although my hair is in pretty good condition, the ends tend to get a little more dry and unruly. I've tried lots of products to fix this problem. The best one is now no longer available. This conditioner from Pacifica is great though! It smells so nice with the coconut scent and it made my hair feel silky in the shower. It also helped my hair look better on the ends. Not 100% fixed, but much better. I liked it so much that I ordered the shampoo. Recommended."
10,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",4.0 out of 5 stars,I really want to like this,"I really want to like this conditioner.  It has all the stuff I want, Vegan and Cruelty free.  Plus it has a lot of the filler stuff you don't want in your hair.  It smells so good.  It has a nice weight to it.  But when I put it in my hair, it disappears.  It doesn't spread very well.  And then when I wash it out my hair feels so dry.  To be fair, I have extremely long hair, it's thickish, kind of curly, and mostly grey.  I have to put oil and other moisturizing products in my hair.  I have this on auto ship and will continue to work with it."
11,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair Feels Worse,"Update, 1/3/22: My hair feels worse than before. It's dry and lacks shine. The shampoo's consistency is very watery (maybe it's suppose to be watery, Idk), but it takes me about three tries to get my head cleaned. Smells good, so it has that going for it.~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•Arrived in a timely manner, but it spilled. Shampoo bottle was open."
12,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful! So runny!,"Awful! This shampoo is so thin and watery! I have to pour 3 big handfuls of shampoo every time I wash my hair because it does not lather up...just feels like wet hair. I have a short (less than shoulder length) style. For the price I paid for this shampoo I would expect much better quality. I have no idea how it got 4.5 stars. The smell is nice but even that seems diluted. My hair does not have that fresh, clean feeling and smell after washing it. I hate this shampoo!"
13,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived open,"I can’t tell if the bottle just broke in transit or if it’s been used, but I didn’t find a safety seal anywhere. I’m hesitant to use it because of this."
14,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this conditioner,I really like how this conditioner and the shampoo clean and condition my long hair with a little bit of damage on the ends...haven't cut my hair in a really long time. The smell is a little too sweet smelling for me kinda like coconut vanilla sugar scent. My hair looks and feels great and smell isnt over powering after your hair dries.
15,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy costumer,"I love all the Pacifica products, especially their shampoos and conditioners, seen I started to use shampoos and conditioners without sulfate my hair is more healthy, shine, the ends they do not break like before, also after I color my hair keep the color in good condition and do not fade it. Thanks Pacifica for great products."
16,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great!,I have long curly hair that tangles. This shampoo and conditioner has cut down on how much hair I actually loose in the shower. It smells like a tropical vacation and Pacifica is great for the environment with no animal testing. Love them. Check out their tinted sunscreen spray and colored lip sunscreens. Coral reef safe.
17,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",3.0 out of 5 stars,Left hair dry,"It’s just ok, very subtle scent. Doesn’t lather up very easily.

20,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for long or thick hair.,Gave it to my husband. It did not condition my thick long hair enough. I had to use another conditioner to make my hair soft.
21,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure if I like it,This shampoo was like water. I love this company and brand. I am just not sure if I would buy this particular shampoo again. I love the smell. I don't see much change in my hair.
22,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",4.0 out of 5 stars,Washes well and light!,"With fine hair most moisturizing shampoos require me to wash daily or look greasy, not with this one though, I can go days between shampooing without having to use dry shampoo either!"

24,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,I love the smell. But it's watery and doesn't suds up well.  My hair feels stripped when I just use the shampoo. Definitely get the conditioner too.

85,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",4.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite shampoo,"So far so good. I have thick hair and a sensitive scalp, so  the hair products search is a pain. Ive only used this about a week but my hair looks, feels and smells good, and my scalp is clean. Cant ask for much more!"
86,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly surprised!,"I ordered this because the ingredients are far less toxic than some other hair care products & I like Pacifica. I was hoping for a very tropical scent but this is more neutral, which is fine. The scent does not linger anyways. I'm using this right now paired with the matching shampoo & am impressed. My hair feels clean, smooth & looks shiny. I'm really happy with this set & plan to keep using."

88,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not real product,This most def not real product it is very thin compared to one’s bought at store or Pacifica. Also no foil seal which is always present in past purchases not on amazon. I enjoy amazon for fast free shipping but will never buy any more health and beauty items on amazon as I don’t trust if they are legitimate.
89,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,SMELLS AMAZING.,"This conditioner smells SO GOOD! The only thing I don’t love is, my hair is pretty thick so it took a lot to cover it and the bottle didn’t last as long as I would have liked. It wasn’t too expensive so it wasn’t too big of a deal. I used it with the pineapple curls shampoo also from Pacifica and they seemed to work well together."

Also, because my hair is so fine, it is weighed down easily. This stuff does not weigh it down, nor does it make it frizzy. I will definitely buy it again."
93,"Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Shampoo - Coconut Power 12 oz, Clear",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hypoallergenic, no hair falling out","Very hydrating! Works well with my fine hair.

Makes my hair feel so soft after use and smells really good. I mixed this in with a purple dye to make a toner and it’s perfect.I wish they sold this in a bigger size tho since I feel like I will have to keep re purchasing.

0,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't do it!!!!!!,"UPDATE 04/21/2021:God awful shampoo! It smelled good, it's clean, but whatever they put in it weighed down my hair and caused so much product buildup I had to go to a salon to get it out. It took 2 cleanses to get *most* of the product out. The hair stylist literally said it looked as though I hadn't washed my hair in 3 weeks when in reality I had been scrubbing for at least a week trying to get it out on my own. Now it could just be me and my hair, but I wouldn't risk it if I were you. This shampoo isn't that amazing. It just smells like coconut in the end.Original 5 star review:I bought this product along with the conditioner after finding out OGX had ingredients in it that when mixed with water create formaldehyde.I wanted something vegan and clean, something I could use and not worry if it'll give me a tumor 10 years down the road.The ingredient list is safe and the shampoo smells great! My hair is a little more greasy than normal but I think it's from switching products. It's definitely worth a shot!"
1,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Watch out for silicone! False advertising!,"I originally bout this conditioner because it was the only one I could find that did not have silicone, mind you I bought it a little over a year ago. At that time it was hard to find a conditioner or shampoo that was free of silicones, sulfate free, and paraben free. I came to realize their ingredients is VERY different that what they are advertising here, and the 4th ingredient is dimethicone, which is silicone. Bad, bad, bad. Products with this in them dry the living hell out of my scalp and hair, I am very disappointed in Pacifica for falsely advertising to me.These days there are regular brands of shampoo and conditioner like Garnier and others that make silicone and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, you don’t have to search anymore and I will just look elsewhere."
2,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am SUPER allergic and everything makes me itch,"I am SUPER allergic and everything makes me itch. So far, I have been able to use Pacifica hair products with out having a reaction. They also work well on my curly hair."
3,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing with it weighing down,"I have been looking for an everyday conditioner that doesn't way my hair down, and keeps my curls moisturized.  So far after a week it's been working well, my hair is slightly damaged at the ends and oily at the roots, combining this with the banana mask has been working wonders on my hair.  Very satisfied and would highly recommend.  The added bonus of the smell is like a summer day at the beach everyday."
4,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great shampoo, but faulty cap - shampoo leaked out.","Received replacement shampoo and used shampoo + conditioner today.I am VERY surprised at how smooth the two Pacifica products made my long, naturally curly/frizzy hair. I can't recall the last time my hair felt so soft, manageable and without that heavy feel. Both products rinsed out quickly, with minimal hair in the drain strainer.Normally alternate between Pantene, TRESemmé and L'Oreal Extraordinary Clay, since it's never a good idea to use the same shampoo / conditioner continuously.Of the four shampoos / conditioners listed, Pacifica Coconut Power Strong and Long, gave the best results. The L'Oreal is comparable to minimal hair in the drain, but the conditioner is extremely difficult to rinse out, even with the hard water we have.Hopefully, the results will always be this favorable, but at least for now, I found a very nice shampoo and conditioner, in Pacifica. The coconut scent is also very pleasant - not overwhelming.Why liquid items are not sealed properly is a mystery to me. Cap is defective (see image) and was delivered with shampoo leaking inside and outside of box.When the cap is in the CLOSED position, there is a gap on the opposite side of the opening, which was crystal clear after washing all the soap and dirt off the cap. The cap does not seal properly. When it's in the fully CLOSED position, the front of the cap opens. Leaked out of both ends.See attached image."
5,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for my hair,"I really wanted to love this product since I'm trying to use better ingredients on my body and hair. I love that it's cruelty free and vegan, and I liked the smell too.Unfortunately, I wouldn't buy this again. I needed to use a lot to cover my long hair, there was very little lather, and it left my hair looking dull and greasy, while feeling dry at the same time. It was more expensive than any other shampoo I've used too. I guess I'll have to continue my search for a shampoo that works better for my hair."
6,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny and soft hair for the first time in my life.,"Hands down the best conditioner I've ever used. My hair is silky and shiny for the first time in my life. I have been dying my hair for years, and this has helped it heal. I noticed it after the first wash. I am in love and will never go back."
7,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost like therapy....,"I would marry this shampoo and conditioner if one could marry inanimate objects and polygamy wasn't illegal. My hair is very grateful for this purchase and happy hair means happy me. I just moved to an area with exceedingly hard water and my hair was starting to suffer greatly. Dull, dry, falling out and just plain depressing to deal with and look at. We were considering splitting and separating completely. Just one ""treatment session"" with this combination of therapists promises a brighter future for my hair and thus myself. Soothing and pleasant aromatherapy was added as a bonus, which puts it on another level. Hopefully, we will see continued improvement in the health and relationship between my hair and me."
8,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"Not my favorite. Love Pacifica and wanted to give their hair care a try. I have fine hair and didn't think it detangled well (which I would expect from conditioner). Don't feel like it did the repair work it advertised. It's okay, but would not re-buy. Lots of other natural, cruelty-free conditioner options that work better."
9,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have straight colored/highlighted hair. Although my hair is in pretty good condition, the ends tend to get a little more dry and unruly. I've tried lots of products to fix this problem. The best one is now no longer available. This conditioner from Pacifica is great though! It smells so nice with the coconut scent and it made my hair feel silky in the shower. It also helped my hair look better on the ends. Not 100% fixed, but much better. I liked it so much that I ordered the shampoo. Recommended."
10,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really want to like this,"I really want to like this conditioner.  It has all the stuff I want, Vegan and Cruelty free.  Plus it has a lot of the filler stuff you don't want in your hair.  It smells so good.  It has a nice weight to it.  But when I put it in my hair, it disappears.  It doesn't spread very well.  And then when I wash it out my hair feels so dry.  To be fair, I have extremely long hair, it's thickish, kind of curly, and mostly grey.  I have to put oil and other moisturizing products in my hair.  I have this on auto ship and will continue to work with it."
11,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair Feels Worse,"Update, 1/3/22: My hair feels worse than before. It's dry and lacks shine. The shampoo's consistency is very watery (maybe it's suppose to be watery, Idk), but it takes me about three tries to get my head cleaned. Smells good, so it has that going for it.~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•Arrived in a timely manner, but it spilled. Shampoo bottle was open."
12,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful! So runny!,"Awful! This shampoo is so thin and watery! I have to pour 3 big handfuls of shampoo every time I wash my hair because it does not lather up...just feels like wet hair. I have a short (less than shoulder length) style. For the price I paid for this shampoo I would expect much better quality. I have no idea how it got 4.5 stars. The smell is nice but even that seems diluted. My hair does not have that fresh, clean feeling and smell after washing it. I hate this shampoo!"
13,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived open,"I can’t tell if the bottle just broke in transit or if it’s been used, but I didn’t find a safety seal anywhere. I’m hesitant to use it because of this."
14,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this conditioner,I really like how this conditioner and the shampoo clean and condition my long hair with a little bit of damage on the ends...haven't cut my hair in a really long time. The smell is a little too sweet smelling for me kinda like coconut vanilla sugar scent. My hair looks and feels great and smell isnt over powering after your hair dries.
15,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy costumer,"I love all the Pacifica products, especially their shampoos and conditioners, seen I started to use shampoos and conditioners without sulfate my hair is more healthy, shine, the ends they do not break like before, also after I color my hair keep the color in good condition and do not fade it. Thanks Pacifica for great products."
16,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great!,I have long curly hair that tangles. This shampoo and conditioner has cut down on how much hair I actually loose in the shower. It smells like a tropical vacation and Pacifica is great for the environment with no animal testing. Love them. Check out their tinted sunscreen spray and colored lip sunscreens. Coral reef safe.
17,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Left hair dry,"It’s just ok, very subtle scent. Doesn’t lather up very easily. Definitely only use once a week or less it left my hair feeling very dry. I do not have oily hair. I only wash once every 3 days or so altering shampoo."
18,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good shampoo,This shampoo is great for my hair and smells good too
19,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Pacifica!,"Pacifica brand is fantastic! Vegan, organic, natural ingredients, and this shampoo/conditioner is my new favorite combo. Amazingly tropical luscious scent that is not too perfumey :)"
20,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for long or thick hair.,Gave it to my husband. It did not condition my thick long hair enough. I had to use another conditioner to make my hair soft.
21,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure if I like it,This shampoo was like water. I love this company and brand. I am just not sure if I would buy this particular shampoo again. I love the smell. I don't see much change in my hair.
22,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Washes well and light!,"With fine hair most moisturizing shampoos require me to wash daily or look greasy, not with this one though, I can go days between shampooing without having to use dry shampoo either!"
23,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,would buy it again,"wonderful shampoo, amazing scent , has a smooth lather, nice feeling shampoo. however was a little disappointed when i opened the box to see there was a small crack in the bottle with some shampoo leaking out."
24,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,I love the smell. But it's watery and doesn't suds up well.  My hair feels stripped when I just use the shampoo. Definitely get the conditioner too.
25,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works and smells great!!,This shampoo is perfect for hard water. I use it daily and have definitely noticed a difference compared to other shampoos. I love the smell!! Will absolutely purchase again.

The top of the tube was split and it leaked in the package, I lost some of the product...because of that I have not used it that much....I am afraid to leave it in the shower and have my 5 year make a mess with it."
29,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t lather up,2 points because cute packaging and good smell.Doesn’t lather up and have to use 2 handfuls to run it through my long hair.

34,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely not worth it,This conditioner is too thin to do anything. I didn’t find it to be moisturizing or anything to my hair. It smells ok but barely.
35,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like heaven,"My favorite part is the smell.

85,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite shampoo,"So far so good. I have thick hair and a sensitive scalp, so  the hair products search is a pain. Ive only used this about a week but my hair looks, feels and smells good, and my scalp is clean. Cant ask for much more!"
86,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly surprised!,"I ordered this because the ingredients are far less toxic than some other hair care products & I like Pacifica. I was hoping for a very tropical scent but this is more neutral, which is fine. The scent does not linger anyways. I'm using this right now paired with the matching shampoo & am impressed. My hair feels clean, smooth & looks shiny. I'm really happy with this set & plan to keep using."

88,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not real product,This most def not real product it is very thin compared to one’s bought at store or Pacifica. Also no foil seal which is always present in past purchases not on amazon. I enjoy amazon for fast free shipping but will never buy any more health and beauty items on amazon as I don’t trust if they are legitimate.
89,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,SMELLS AMAZING.,"This conditioner smells SO GOOD! The only thing I don’t love is, my hair is pretty thick so it took a lot to cover it and the bottle didn’t last as long as I would have liked. It wasn’t too expensive so it wasn’t too big of a deal. I used it with the pineapple curls shampoo also from Pacifica and they seemed to work well together."

91,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing!,I use Pacifica face wash so I thought I’d try the shampoo & conditioner besides the set was a great price and I ended up loving this stuff it smells amazing and leaves hair super soft!!
92,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I love this stuff. It smells great, and it keeps my super fine hair moisturized. Also, because my hair is so fine, it is weighed down easily. This stuff does not weigh it down, nor does it make it frizzy. I will definitely buy it again."
93,Pacifica Strong and Long Moisturizing Conditioner - Coconut Power 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hypoallergenic, no hair falling out","Very hydrating! Works well with my fine hair. Usually my hair falls off when using conditioner but with this one, it doesn’t. Ingredients look very clean according to CosDNA."

0,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It might be an authentic product.,"I found this product at Target and it smelled amazing and I wanted to try it, but checkout line was long so I ordered on Amazon instead. The packaging looks and feels like standard Pacifica packaging (I have many of their products). The product also smells almost exactly like it did in the store (we are talking a very strong coconut scent). My only concern that makes me question the legitimacy of this product is the thickness. If you look inside the bottle, it appears to be a white cream. The product at Target was definitely more liquid than this, something akin to a thick serum.  I did shake the bottle to see if maybe some components had separated but when I rechecked the consistency, it definitely still looked like a cream. Even though the one I received appears thicker, the trigger spray delivers product without issue and the product itself is nice and working well. Overall I'm happy with it and will continue to use the product but will likely not purchase it through Amazon again."
1,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Ew,UPDATE: I actually had to throw my brush away cuz I couldn’t get the smell out….. I washed it TWICE with shampoo and scrubbed it with a toothbrush and it still had the smell from this product on it.This stuff stinks. I really wanted to like this cuz I love this brand but….. it’s a no for me. I’m going to be really honest: in the bottle it smells like sour coconut milk….. put it in your hair and it smells like sweaty balls….. not gonna lie… makes your hair soft though but I CANNOT get past the smell! Would not buy again and do NOT recommend
2,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight - Tames frizz without greasy look,"I have lots of fine blonde hair with a slight natural wave. It will lightly frizz in humidity and I look scruffy. Conditioner alone won't stop the frizz.I use this pretty liberally after the shower. Brush it through. It leaves my hair much less frizz-prone, but also not weighted down like many heavier products that my fine hair can't take.It smells nice and light, not overly perfumed.  Surprised ho much I love this product - been consistently using it for 2 years!"
3,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great!,"This detangler smells wonderful and works very well. I love Pacifica products and this one didn’t let me down. My only complaint is the nozzle, I wish it sprayed out more of a wide mist instead of a direct stream of product, but overall I recommend and will continue to use."
4,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"I really like product, I don't think there is a Pacifica product I haven't liked. The scent is great, although now that I think about it, it's almost like a 'cheap' coconut smell at first, but once it's on your hair for a while the smell wears off to a better coconut smell in my opinion. I tend not to have any luck with these kind of sprayers.. they always seem to clog with products (for some reason every product I've had with these sprayers are thick ?) For one use the sprayer didn't work and then just started working again/ the product does to as says and detangles like it should/ Ive never sprayed on dry hair-only after washing with towel dried hair, I've used on my roots,length,and ends and there's no issue with stiffness any where like with someone leave in detangle product, with some I can feel the texture left on my hair or like a film almost. Not with this. I coulr see it maybe leaning towards that if over used. But I've have no problem with it! I spray on towel dried hair, brush it out and either towel dry and do heatless curls over night / air dry and straighten the next day. And either way my hair is always soft and manageable the following day. And that says alot! My hair tangles very easy!! I've used this several times before writing the review just so I could get a good grasp on it before sharing my opinion. Also!! My hair is wavy,damaged, and frizzy  - I've used this on my 3 yo daughters hair with the same results and her hair is spirly curls! I would say due to the differential in our hair types this is for use of all hair types!:)"
5,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It does the job without the chemicals,I've been using Pacifica shampoo and conditioner for a few years and loved them. I purchased this product for two reasons:1. I needed something to keep the ends of my (long hair) pointy tail from knotting when I went out for a run2. The product needed to be free of harsh chemicals AND overbearing scents and artificial fragrances.This product was just perfect for my needs. It keeps the tangles at bay while providing just the right amount of moisture. There is a gentle coconut scent - nothing over-bearing. I recommend it highly!
6,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent detangler and leave in moisturizer,"I’ve been using this pacifica detangler for over a year now. I either order it from the actual site (as I am a big fan of the brand) or just here on Amazon when I want a single and fast transaction. I have long hair with a lot of dry, damaged ends from not having a hair cut since right before Covid, over a year and a half ago. I love the length I have obtained from this but I have to be sure to use plenty of conditioning things on my ends to prevent the ends from looking or becoming too frayed. With this product and others in my regimen I’d say that I’m pretty successful in keeping my hair looking and feeling healthy. Before Covid I was a regular trimmer (every few months), yet almost a year and a half later with no trims, I like my hair better than ever. This product is keeping my hair gorgeous and allowing me to continue to grow it out. Also, it smells good. It’s affordable. Go for it"
7,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works!,"I was a bit worried this wouldn’t work because I have such fine/thin hair and I’m sensitive to certain scents/ingredients but I gave it a shot, and it does work and it’s got a nice coconut-y smell that isn’t too overwhelming, as long as I don’t use it in a closed off room. I also use it with a deranged brush, and both have saved my hair!"
8,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Conditions without weighing my fine hair down,"Great price and great detangle and leave-in conditioner. It helps whether I am doing my hair naturally curly or I style it. I have fine hair, and it doesn't weigh it down at all."
9,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Nope!,This is what you send customers? Looks like it has been used ... very unsatisfied. This will be going into the trash
10,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Rancid smell after being open for a month,"I liked this product at first, but after it sitting for one month, it now smells completely rancid! It makes me want to throw up it's so gross. I don't know what happened, and it sucks because I actually like the texture it made my hair."
11,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,10/10 MUST TRY!!!!!!!,I’m so in love with this!!! I have bleached hair and nothing was working for me until I would this detangler and it is so amazing I will definitely be buying more. Not only does it smell amazing but it leaves my hair so soft. I would recommend this spray I swear you won’t regret it!!
12,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for detangling curly hair,"I have very curly hair (3b) and use it to detangle and comb my hair before showering. It makes it easier to run a brush through and it doesn't hurt as much to comb after using this product. I did end up adding a bit of water because it is very thick, bug I didn't see that as a huge issue. Overall, I would buy again."
13,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,You receive old hardened product,Purchased to put in my mom's stocking and bottle/nozzle won't work. Then I realized it wasn't the knozzle the detangler was hardened in the bottle. Super old and very thick. Waste of money.
14,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best I’ve ever used!,I have very curly hair that gets very tangled.  I wash and brush it once a week and this is one of the best detangler I’ve ever used. It really works wonders on giant knots and the smell is awesome
15,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,does smell reminiscent of playdoh but in a good way,very much like coconut and playdoh but in the most non-nauseating way.  for de-tangling it works moderately well and the spray mechanism does more often than not make the spray a stream.  if you add some water to thin it out after a little of the product has been removed from the bottle it thins out better and you get a more even spray.
16,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like a dead fish.. gross!,Smells like a dead fish.. worked great but I had to wash my kids head after using.. smelled so bad.. not sure why.. there's so fish product or algae.. not sure if it was defective or experiencing when received.. I need a detangler but one that smells good
17,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Old product,Product was old. Thick like pudding and smelled old. I want to order another one but I don't want an old one.
18,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Yuck,I'd give it a zero if I could!!  Made my long curly hair even more tangled and frizzy!  I gave it away
19,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle is faulty,I cannot really review the product since the nozzle to dispense it is missing from the bottle I received. I gave 1 star because at the very least some degree of quality control should be implemented.
20,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Another winner from Pacifica,I love most Pacifica products and this one is no exception. I love that it is natural and effective.
21,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good!,My favorite detangle spray! Smells great and knots brush out so easily and pain free!
22,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Product is too thick for nozzle,"This product I really wanted to love, it smells good, it works well, but the product is wayyy too thick to spray out of the nozzle. I had to empty about 1/4 of the bottle so that I could add hot water so that it would be thin enough to spray. The texture is like conditioner so just be aware of that when you purchase :)"
23,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad smell,After only a week of owning it it smelled awful!
24,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not my cup of tea,"It may work for others, but it didn't do it for me. Also very strong scent"
25,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Unusable due to thickening of product,Pretty disappointed. I love Pacifica products but this gelled up within a week and is basically as solid as gel deodorant at this point. The spray nozzle is unable to work due to the thick product jammed inside. What a waste of money. Don’t know if this is anomaly but I can’t recommend it at all.
26,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The BEST detanglet and conditioner of curly hair I have seen in fifty years!!,See above
27,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Received nozzle missing pieces,"First time buying the product, and it’s the best detangler I’ve ever used. Only issue is the nozzle came in missing some pieces so I have to use another nozzle head unfortunately to use the product."
28,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,You’ll never buy another detangler again!,This is my number one product on my vanity!!!! A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE!!
29,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and very effective,"i use this to detangle my daughter's very curly hair and it works great, leaves the hair soft, and doesn't feel tacky like some other detanglers."
30,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sooo good!,This stuff is the bomb!!!
31,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,I love this. My daughter has curly hair this product makes her curls soft and bounce. No more frizz. I use it on myself as well and I have wavy hair.
32,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,This is amazing and detangles my son's hair
33,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too thick for sprayer,"Too thick to spray. Shaking isn’t enough. Constantly have to add warm water. Smells great, though."
34,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It really works for them hard tangles,Used for my hair
35,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,"Wonderful detangler, smells great!! Works very well!"
36,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product from a brand I like,Works well - smells good
37,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,Great product
38,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it and recommend!,I love this!!!! It smells so good and it makes my hair healthy and soft!
39,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,Good quality a little high in the price and smells good
40,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Like it,Smells great. Seems to work well. But the pump/spray part doesn't work. Seriously sucks cause it's for a 9 year old
41,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"Smells amazing, detangles easily"
42,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not my favorite,I have tried so many detanglers and will continue to try more. This one smells very strong which is okay to me because I like the scent but not everyone will. It is so thick that it is difficult to spray. It left a film on my hair that I didn’t care for. Too heavy for my fine blond hair. On to the next…
43,"Pacifica Coconut milk detangle elixir, 7 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff works great to get snarls out!,Definitely think it’s worth the purchase! It works really good to get my snarls out….. An I like the coconut smell to it.

Expensive shampoo. Cheap shampoo. No shampoo (no-poo). Natural shampoo. Essential oil rinses. Apple cider rinses.I have fine hair, and a lot of it. And it is always oily. We are talking: wash in the morning, dry shampoo along my hairline at the end of the day oily, and a hearty dry shampoo regimine if I'm going to try to go a day without washing.This shampoo has done what literraly no other shampoo has done - I can go three days without washing, and it still looks amazing. My hair is clean, soft, full of volume (an unexpected bonus, but I'll take it!) without using ANY product in it other than shampoo! And - I can let it air dry without it going incredibly flat! What???? How can this be true?!?!?!Welp, folks, it's real - a shampoo that actually helps your oily scalp, and provides you with volume, that you don't need to blow dry. This product has literally changed my whole hair routine!"

There was no seal and shampoo was leaking around the edges."
2,Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Purify Invigorating Shampoo + Rosemary Purify Invigorating Conditioner | Detox Scalp and Hair from Product Buildup & Excess Oil | 100% Vegan & Cruelty | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this invigorating shampoo,I'm happy with the shampoo but wish the scent of rosemary was more noticeable. I still like the smell of the shampoo and the bottle does say 'rosemary and mint.' It's just that it smells more like mint than rosemary. I do like the way it leaves my hair after washing it because it is not tangled up like with other shampoos and it feels very moisturized and my scalp is definitely invigorated. I have not tried the companion conditioner yet and I think I may need to  buy one soon and try the combo. I definitely recommend it!
3,Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Purify Invigorating Shampoo + Rosemary Purify Invigorating Conditioner | Detox Scalp and Hair from Product Buildup & Excess Oil | 100% Vegan & Cruelty | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great Pacifica product,"Love this shampoo! My hair is long and thick, and has a tendency to be limp and a bit oily if wished in 'moisturizing' shampoos. But so many of them leave my hair feeling like straw. This shampoo does a great job of refreshing hair and scalp but not drying them out. The fragrance is so mild that it's a whiff instead of a smack in the nose! (Which for someone with allergies is great.) I've been using the Pacifica rosemary conditioner with another shampoo until that one ran out. Hurray! My hair's all Pacifica now."
4,Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Purify Invigorating Shampoo + Rosemary Purify Invigorating Conditioner | Detox Scalp and Hair from Product Buildup & Excess Oil | 100% Vegan & Cruelty | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for oily hair!,"Great for oily hair! I have tried SO MANY different shampoos and conditioners for my daughter, and this is by far the best! I have been using Pacifica for about ten years, and the quality is excellent. I only buy truly natural and chemical free cosmetics, and I love that I can count on them for great quality. This particular shampoo and conditioner combination is excellent! My daughter has oily hair, and even gets clogged pores in her scalp. I have tried more shampoo than I can count. This has been the best by far. Her hair is beautiful, and shiny, and is not heavy. It washes out easily for her, which is another struggle for her. It gives her a nice clean wash, without drying out her hair."
5,Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Purify Invigorating Shampoo + Rosemary Purify Invigorating Conditioner | Detox Scalp and Hair from Product Buildup & Excess Oil | 100% Vegan & Cruelty | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than salon conditioner,This leaves your hair soft and smooth yet easily manageable. It's perfect when using it after the matching shampoo.  Just be sure to rinse until the slick feeling is gone so that it leaves bounce and doesn't weigh your hair down.

The smell is amazing. As a detox shampoo, this does make your hair feel a bit “stripped” at first , so I am always sure to give my hair a little extra TLC while conditioning afterwards. Overall a great product."
7,Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Purify Invigorating Shampoo + Rosemary Purify Invigorating Conditioner | Detox Scalp and Hair from Product Buildup & Excess Oil | 100% Vegan & Cruelty | Sulfate + Paraben Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Shampoo,"I started out not really liking this shampoo and conditioner.  It doesn't lather too well, so you have to use a lot.  It wasn't until I noticed that there was a lot less hair in my brush and drain that I started to notice the great affects it was having on my hair.  It feels fuller and I noticeably loose less hair.  I'd  highly recommend this shampoo to help with hair lose.  The smell is more peppermint than rosemary which I'd have liked more rosemary scent.  Try it!"
8,Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Purify Invigorating Shampoo + Rosemary Purify Invigorating Conditioner | Detox Scalp and Hair from Product Buildup & Excess Oil | 100% Vegan & Cruelty | Sulfate + Paraben Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This shampoo is great, but with a small scent and tingly feel on my scalp","I like this shampoo because it's vegan, cruelty free, and doesn't have any harmful preservatives or SLS. It does a great job washing my hair, and it has a slight scent to it which smells pretty good. However, I should warn you that the product will give you scalp a tingly feeling to it, I think it's the mint in the product that gives you that feeling. So if you don't want to have that feeling on your scalp then don't get this shampoo. I don't mind it though, the mint is supposed to help soothe your scalp if you have dandruff or eczema like me."

It has a wonderful light minty scent that is precisely enough without being too much, and the shampoo itself is a great consistency. The performance, however, leaves much to be desired, and it basically feels like I’ve washed my hair with a bar of cheap soap (not exaggerating, that’s very analogous to the result).Put simply: After using this stuff, I literally had to *rewash* my hair with my large bottle of (very cheap/not so great) all in one shampoo/conditioner I only keep around for emergencies.Perhaps your luck will be better than mine. It does, again, smell wonderful."

It leaves my scalp feeling so refreshed and clean. It also helps control oil buildup so if you have to skip a day of washing your hair your hair still looks clean and freshly washed the next day.

0,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Holy Grail of shampoo for fine, greasy hair and scalp","Folks, I've tried everything. Expensive shampoo. Cheap shampoo. No shampoo (no-poo). Natural shampoo. Essential oil rinses. Apple cider rinses.I have fine hair, and a lot of it. And it is always oily. We are talking: wash in the morning, dry shampoo along my hairline at the end of the day oily, and a hearty dry shampoo regimine if I'm going to try to go a day without washing.This shampoo has done what literraly no other shampoo has done - I can go three days without washing, and it still looks amazing. My hair is clean, soft, full of volume (an unexpected bonus, but I'll take it!) without using ANY product in it other than shampoo! And - I can let it air dry without it going incredibly flat! What???? How can this be true?!?!?!Welp, folks, it's real - a shampoo that actually helps your oily scalp, and provides you with volume, that you don't need to blow dry. This product has literally changed my whole hair routine!"
1,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used,"This was a used, grimy bottle of shampoo that looks like it was refilled with a different product. There was no seal and shampoo was leaking around the edges."
2,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this invigorating shampoo,I'm happy with the shampoo but wish the scent of rosemary was more noticeable. I still like the smell of the shampoo and the bottle does say 'rosemary and mint.' It's just that it smells more like mint than rosemary. I do like the way it leaves my hair after washing it because it is not tangled up like with other shampoos and it feels very moisturized and my scalp is definitely invigorated. I have not tried the companion conditioner yet and I think I may need to  buy one soon and try the combo. I definitely recommend it!
3,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great Pacifica product,"Love this shampoo! My hair is long and thick, and has a tendency to be limp and a bit oily if wished in 'moisturizing' shampoos. But so many of them leave my hair feeling like straw. This shampoo does a great job of refreshing hair and scalp but not drying them out. The fragrance is so mild that it's a whiff instead of a smack in the nose! (Which for someone with allergies is great.) I've been using the Pacifica rosemary conditioner with another shampoo until that one ran out. Hurray! My hair's all Pacifica now."
4,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for oily hair!,"Great for oily hair! I have tried SO MANY different shampoos and conditioners for my daughter, and this is by far the best! I have been using Pacifica for about ten years, and the quality is excellent. I only buy truly natural and chemical free cosmetics, and I love that I can count on them for great quality. This particular shampoo and conditioner combination is excellent! My daughter has oily hair, and even gets clogged pores in her scalp. I have tried more shampoo than I can count. This has been the best by far. Her hair is beautiful, and shiny, and is not heavy. It washes out easily for her, which is another struggle for her. It gives her a nice clean wash, without drying out her hair."
5,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than salon conditioner,This leaves your hair soft and smooth yet easily manageable. It's perfect when using it after the matching shampoo.  Just be sure to rinse until the slick feeling is gone so that it leaves bounce and doesn't weigh your hair down.
6,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Will buy again!,"I’m a Pacifica enthusiast and this has been added to my list of favorites! The smell is amazing. As a detox shampoo, this does make your hair feel a bit “stripped” at first , so I am always sure to give my hair a little extra TLC while conditioning afterwards. Overall a great product."
7,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Shampoo,"I started out not really liking this shampoo and conditioner.  It doesn't lather too well, so you have to use a lot.  It wasn't until I noticed that there was a lot less hair in my brush and drain that I started to notice the great affects it was having on my hair.  It feels fuller and I noticeably loose less hair.  I'd  highly recommend this shampoo to help with hair lose.  The smell is more peppermint than rosemary which I'd have liked more rosemary scent.  Try it!"
8,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This shampoo is great, but with a small scent and tingly feel on my scalp","I like this shampoo because it's vegan, cruelty free, and doesn't have any harmful preservatives or SLS. It does a great job washing my hair, and it has a slight scent to it which smells pretty good. However, I should warn you that the product will give you scalp a tingly feeling to it, I think it's the mint in the product that gives you that feeling. So if you don't want to have that feeling on your scalp then don't get this shampoo. I don't mind it though, the mint is supposed to help soothe your scalp if you have dandruff or eczema like me."
9,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is less a clarifying shampoo than a stripping shampoo and if you are purchasing it in the hope of using it as a less expensive replacement for the tried and true standard bearer of the rosemary mint genre, you will be deeply unsatisfied with the outcome.I wanted to love this. It has a wonderful light minty scent that is precisely enough without being too much, and the shampoo itself is a great consistency. The performance, however, leaves much to be desired, and it basically feels like I’ve washed my hair with a bar of cheap soap (not exaggerating, that’s very analogous to the result).Put simply: After using this stuff, I literally had to *rewash* my hair with my large bottle of (very cheap/not so great) all in one shampoo/conditioner I only keep around for emergencies.Perhaps your luck will be better than mine. It does, again, smell wonderful."
10,Pacifica Invigorating Shampoo - Rosemary Purify 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have,I recommend getting the Pacifica scalp detox scrub and follow up with this shampoo for the best possible results. It leaves my scalp feeling so refreshed and clean. It also helps control oil buildup so if you have to skip a day of washing your hair your hair still looks clean and freshly washed the next day.

We are talking: wash in the morning, dry shampoo along my hairline at the end of the day oily, and a hearty dry shampoo regimine if I'm going to try to go a day without washing.This shampoo has done what literraly no other shampoo has done - I can go three days without washing, and it still looks amazing. My hair is clean, soft, full of volume (an unexpected bonus, but I'll take it!) without using ANY product in it other than shampoo! And - I can let it air dry without it going incredibly flat! What???? How can this be true?!?!?!Welp, folks, it's real - a shampoo that actually helps your oily scalp, and provides you with volume, that you don't need to blow dry. This product has literally changed my whole hair routine!"
1,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used,"This was a used, grimy bottle of shampoo that looks like it was refilled with a different product. There was no seal and shampoo was leaking around the edges."
2,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this invigorating shampoo,I'm happy with the shampoo but wish the scent of rosemary was more noticeable. I still like the smell of the shampoo and the bottle does say 'rosemary and mint.' It's just that it smells more like mint than rosemary. I do like the way it leaves my hair after washing it because it is not tangled up like with other shampoos and it feels very moisturized and my scalp is definitely invigorated. I have not tried the companion conditioner yet and I think I may need to  buy one soon and try the combo. I definitely recommend it!
3,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great Pacifica product,"Love this shampoo! My hair is long and thick, and has a tendency to be limp and a bit oily if wished in 'moisturizing' shampoos. But so many of them leave my hair feeling like straw. This shampoo does a great job of refreshing hair and scalp but not drying them out. The fragrance is so mild that it's a whiff instead of a smack in the nose! (Which for someone with allergies is great.) I've been using the Pacifica rosemary conditioner with another shampoo until that one ran out. Hurray! My hair's all Pacifica now."
4,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for oily hair!,"Great for oily hair! I have tried SO MANY different shampoos and conditioners for my daughter, and this is by far the best! I have been using Pacifica for about ten years, and the quality is excellent. I only buy truly natural and chemical free cosmetics, and I love that I can count on them for great quality. This particular shampoo and conditioner combination is excellent! My daughter has oily hair, and even gets clogged pores in her scalp. I have tried more shampoo than I can count. This has been the best by far. Her hair is beautiful, and shiny, and is not heavy. It washes out easily for her, which is another struggle for her. It gives her a nice clean wash, without drying out her hair."
5,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than salon conditioner,This leaves your hair soft and smooth yet easily manageable. It's perfect when using it after the matching shampoo.  Just be sure to rinse until the slick feeling is gone so that it leaves bounce and doesn't weigh your hair down.
6,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Will buy again!,"I’m a Pacifica enthusiast and this has been added to my list of favorites! The smell is amazing. As a detox shampoo, this does make your hair feel a bit “stripped” at first , so I am always sure to give my hair a little extra TLC while conditioning afterwards. Overall a great product."
7,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Shampoo,"I started out not really liking this shampoo and conditioner.  It doesn't lather too well, so you have to use a lot.  It wasn't until I noticed that there was a lot less hair in my brush and drain that I started to notice the great affects it was having on my hair.  It feels fuller and I noticeably loose less hair.  I'd  highly recommend this shampoo to help with hair lose.  The smell is more peppermint than rosemary which I'd have liked more rosemary scent.  Try it!"
8,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This shampoo is great, but with a small scent and tingly feel on my scalp","I like this shampoo because it's vegan, cruelty free, and doesn't have any harmful preservatives or SLS. It does a great job washing my hair, and it has a slight scent to it which smells pretty good. However, I should warn you that the product will give you scalp a tingly feeling to it, I think it's the mint in the product that gives you that feeling. So if you don't want to have that feeling on your scalp then don't get this shampoo. I don't mind it though, the mint is supposed to help soothe your scalp if you have dandruff or eczema like me."
9,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is less a clarifying shampoo than a stripping shampoo and if you are purchasing it in the hope of using it as a less expensive replacement for the tried and true standard bearer of the rosemary mint genre, you will be deeply unsatisfied with the outcome.I wanted to love this. It has a wonderful light minty scent that is precisely enough without being too much, and the shampoo itself is a great consistency. The performance, however, leaves much to be desired, and it basically feels like I’ve washed my hair with a bar of cheap soap (not exaggerating, that’s very analogous to the result).Put simply: After using this stuff, I literally had to *rewash* my hair with my large bottle of (very cheap/not so great) all in one shampoo/conditioner I only keep around for emergencies.Perhaps your luck will be better than mine. It does, again, smell wonderful."
10,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have,I recommend getting the Pacifica scalp detox scrub and follow up with this shampoo for the best possible results. It leaves my scalp feeling so refreshed and clean. It also helps control oil buildup so if you have to skip a day of washing your hair your hair still looks clean and freshly washed the next day.
11,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sleek,"Don't need a lot! I have very thick hair but using only a nickle sized amount covers my whole head. I only wash my hair once a week so I need about 4 washes to see a big change. I had bad dandruff from working in a dry environment. Never had dandruff before then. Anyway, this helped A TON. My hair feels so sleek and commercial-like."
12,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Scent,"I love the smell and feel of the product. Anything by this brand I normally love.A word of warning to those with sensitive skin, this one really irritated my skin. I get eczema easily so this is not something I could keep on using."
13,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it so far,Both the shampoo and conditioner are new to me. I was looking for something to really cleanse my scalp while being gentle and kind to my home-dyed hair.  I like the way they smell.  I've only used them once but so far so good.
14,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Same price & quality as purchased in store,It is exactly the same as when purchased in store. Very handy to have delivered when I can't get to the big box store that sells it. I'm very picky about scent & really love this stuff.
15,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves you feeling super clean!,"The scent is very strong, but if you don’t mind the way tea tree oil smells or rosemary then it won’t bother you! It can make your eyes water tho 😂 it definitely gives you that invigorating clean. It washes away all the impurities that other shampoos and conditioners have deposited on your hair. Take care of yourself with this brand! I will never NOT recommend this brand to everyone I talk to."
16,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good shampoo,Although would prefer scent free for every day breathing and skin health as well...its fragrance is a nice light herb smell that is not migraine or sneeze inducing!
17,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Leaked in package,I haven't used it yet but it did leak and get over all of the other items I'd ordered. Luckily almost everything I ordered with it was individually wrapped but it did leak out of the plastic that it was in. I don't want to have to send it back so I'll still use it and try to remember to update afterwards. I do like the smell.
18,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deserves all the5 star reviews!,"Rosemary Purify may be the best variety of shampoo that Pacifica makes. Really got my hair and scalp feeling clean, without stripping  color, etc. Great fresh fragrance too."
19,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"This has definitely made my hair less oily and I can go 2 days between washes instead of just 1. It smells great, lathers well and rinses clean."
20,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Love the shampoo but wasn't impressed with the conditioner I felt like it took the moisture out of my hair smells nice not to over powering
21,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,Love this! I have always struggled with dandruff and this is the first shampoo that cleared it up! I love the scent and tingly feeling. This is the shampoo i will keep buying from now on
22,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than salon shampoo,This leaves your hair clean without feeling stripped. The mint makes your scalp feel awesome. It's perfectly complimented by the matching conditioner.
23,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best cleansing shampoo,"I love this shampoo it’s such a wonderful cleanser, instead of stripping the scalp it totally nourishes and refreshes"
24,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my scalp.,I have curly hair and this does leave my curly hair fine however my scalp is itchy and flakey after switching to this shampoo really bummed out because ive used rosemary shampoos before and they normally dont do this to me maybe it works for other people but not for my scalp.
25,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Possible prior return,No safety seal on it.
26,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful,Smells great and feels soothing
27,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not sealed,This shampoo bottle came not sealed so beware.
28,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Pacifica.,"This product leaves my hair soft,rejuvenated,its not heavy on my hair at all. And smells amazing."
29,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Silky conditioner,I love this conditioner! It glides through the hair like silk
30,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent scent,Wonderful shampoo leaves hair clean and full
31,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great head of hair,"I love this product. For someone who washes their hair daily, this product is great"
32,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for dry skin.,"Good scent, too harsh for me. It left me with a dry scalp."
33,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't like mint and I love it,"Not a big mint fan, but it works great."
34,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad,I bought this product to help my curls not to make my curls dry and frizzy. Don’t waste your money.
35,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome for oily hair!,"My hair is notoriously oily at the roots. Most other shampoos (like tea tree oil shampoos) tend to make my hair feel ""stripped"" if that makes any sense, and don't necessarily help with oily roots. Well, this is 3 days after my last shampoo! Would normally look like an oil slick, but no longer. So glad I made this impulse buy. Also, I agree with other reviewers that the smell is more minty than rosemary, but not necessarily in a bad way."
36,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleaned my hair well,"Without sulfates. Loved the smell, woke me up!"
37,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as great as I hoped,I bought this and was disappointed. It irritated my scalp. Will be returning. :(
38,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,there is no seal,"there is no seal , wonder thats how this is sold ?"
39,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great!,"Smells great, makes my hair look good, and is vegan and cruelty free.  This is my new go to every time I buy new conditioner (and the matching shampoo)."
40,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great smell,I love the minty smell of this shampoo.  I also love that it's vegan and cruelty free.  It makes my scalp feel really clean too.
41,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not what I thought would be, too drying.",This was more drying than moisturizing. Same with the shampoo.
42,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Underwhelming,"I like the ingredient list, no sulfates or pthalates, but overall I am not impressed. The shampoo has a strange consistency, and both smell like herbal peppermint. It’s not bad, but definitely not very good. I’ve noticed less buildup on my scalp (yay!) and no real change in hair growth or loss (oh well), but my hair definitely isn’t as clean and does NOT stay clean as long as cheaper shampoos. (Maybe it’s the price to pay for being sulfate free but it is still disappointing.) I am not sure what if anything the conditioner does, and don’t plan on buying either again."
43,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why I subscribe,This shampoo is the reason I started the subscription service through Amazon. I now get all my household stuff delivered monthly BUT this shampoo is the ONLY shampoo that helped my daughters dry scalp. It started this fall and got significantly worse in the winter. No one in my family had flakes like hers. We tried everything and of course head and shoulders actually made it worse. This is one of many I bought at target to try and it was the winner by a land slide. target doesn’t consistently have this in stock and it’s the exact same price as here so I now have it delivered every 3 weeks. Best best best dry scalp shampoo with a great scent.
44,Pacifica Invigorating Conditioner - Rosemary Purify 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice and minty,Wanted to like this more but the shampoo is very drying but once you follow with conditioner hair is soft and manageable.I massaged both in my scalp and it was refreshing.
0,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's water... underwhelming.,"I was highly anticipating this as a close friend of mine loves Pacifica's products (she hasn't tried this one in particular.) I'm not one to usually go after the latest ""snake oil"", my intentions were really just to have that advertised good smell and maybe feel like my scalp was fresher afterwards. I'm SO disappointed. It's... water. Yes, it's a little slick, there are oils etc in it. It has an herbal smell of some kind (not one I recognize as Rosemary Mint) but only if I practically have my nose in the bottle. I tried this before shampooing as instructed and honestly my hair just felt gross and I couldn't smell or feel anything while massaging into my scalp. I will say the saving grace was that the return process was a breeze. They offered me returnless refund via Amazon credit, which I'm fine with.If Pacifica works for you, great. Maybe this was a weak/bad batch, I don't know. But I will say I had a better smelling and more cleansing experience using my husband's $2 Rosemary Mint Suave shampoo."
1,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it,"This is my first scalp serum. I have very itchy and oily scalp and hoped to find a product that would soothe. I wouldn't say this has a cooling effect, but it makes my roots feel nourished and decreases some build-up. I like to massage one full dropper of serum into my scalp after washing my hair. It leaves absolutely no stickiness or residue."
2,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perky hair overnight,Not sure about the negative reviews.  This product is great!  My hair is perky at the roots and for someone (me) with super fine hair and thingning it makes a huge difference.  I usually do an overnight treatment and today trying an after shower leave in treatment.  Definitely recommend this but you have figure out what works for you as far as treatment.
3,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,Relief for itchy scalp. Great for wig wearers!,"I was experiencing itching in the area I wear my wig grip band, and it was driving me up the wall. This product provided relief from a dry irritated scalp. However, I had to use it more frequently than directed.  After a few days of applications and hair washings the itchiness went away."
4,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pacifica produces another GEM!,"This is a hidden gem product. I love Pacifica, but I haven't tried everything they offer. This stuff made an immediate impact on my hair, which is vibrantly colored. It smells fresh and delicious. It's softening, soothing, and refreshing. It just plain works, so don't hesitate to give it a try. As far as I know, you can return it if you don't like it, but I'm hoping you will love it as much as I do."
5,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money.,This scrub has huge pieces of sea salt in the formula but no matter how thoroughly I scrub I can’t feel them. I have short hair too. This product seemed to make my scalp more irritated than anything. The product was not a cohesive scrub it fell apart immediately when it got on my hands. I ended up stepping on more of the product in the shower than what actually ended up on my scalp.
6,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too chunky,"This smells really nice, but doesn't seem to do much scrubbing, as the particles are quite coarse and there aren't many of them to begin with. It seemed like 3 or 4 chunks of salt per square inch of scalp."
7,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,This contains small rocks.,This scalp scrub has rocks in it.  I have thick hair and it was hard to wash all the rocks out of my hair.  I had my hair up at work. My scalp was itchy and sore. I had a small rock still stuck in my hair near my scalp.
8,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Has my scalp free of ingrown hairs,"After years of painful ingrown hairs on back of my scalp, my Barber recommended this due to her personal experience. I bought it doubting my lifelong problem would be fixed. One use and my scalp looked and felt COMPLETELY different within two weeks. Now, me, my barber as well as the shop owner recommend this to everyone they meet who has ingrown hairs on their scalp. It’s better than any of the other 5 products I own."
9,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use & helped my dry, itchy scalp.","I have been using this a few nights a week for about a month as an overnight scalp treatment. It has a thin, viscous texture. The texture and ingredients are fairly similar to a basic facial serum (hyaluronic acid, b5,aloe, witch hazel). I apply 4 droppers full in lines over my scalp from front to back, then massage it gently into the scalp and comb the residue through my roots before bed. In the am I shower as usual. This winter had been pretty hard on my skin in general with me needing extra thick moisturizers on my full arms and legs as opposed to just my knees and elbows. This has really helped with my dry, itchy scalp. I don't think this serum would work for a scalp condition like dandruff that needs medication; but for just a dry scalp it really made a difference. I took a star off for the poor dropper. It seems to have trouble pulling the product from the container."
10,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,PAIN to use!!,"This stuff is a PAIN to use! It is HARD to get down into the roots and the salt grains are HUGE, they just roll off of your head! If the salt crystals were 1/4 the size, it would be much easier to use. It smells great, but the poor instructions on the tube dont explain how to use it to get the most benefit."
11,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Pacifica Addition,I’ve been looking for a product to clear my crown chakra and this does the trick with sage. It soothes and hydrates the scalp just like a spa treatment. Simply massage into scalp then shampoo out or leave in overnight.
12,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Impressed,Like many others were saying this product isn't right. I was surprised the beads weren't water dissolvable. So you get it in your hair and it is a pain to get out. AVOID if you have thick or a lot of hair. My hair is short and all the way thru shampooing and conditioning I was still picking out those little beads. It smells like tea tree oil but a little lighter so that wasn't bad. It is not an easy product to work with overall. I wouldn't recommend.
13,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"Like other reviews have said, its really hard to get a good scrub out if this. It’s too chunky & doesn't get to your scalp easily. I made sure to follow instructions with sectioning my hair but it still just ended up in my hair & not my scalp. I used the whole bottle to try & give it a fair shot but it’s not worth repurchasing. Plus it runs out too fast.The only reason for the 2 star was the smell & “minty” feeling it gives my hair."
14,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,It smells great! Wish it worked better,I have a lot of build up on my scalp similar to psoriasis. I get a lot of flakes and then oily patches. I bought this to help as a pre treatment to break up the patches. It smelled great and loved the way it felt on my scalp. Not sure it made much a differece on my scalp even after using as an overnight treatment.
15,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pacifica,I really enjoyed using this. It has a very light scent and is really great when using to massage the scalp. I know it says only to use 3 to 4 drops but it requires a few more than that be able to distribute throughout your scalp. Other than that it is marvelous.
16,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for scalp, works for me.",This product smells great and I use it once a week to help with dry scalp and build up. So far no complaints.
17,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,Witch hazel is not for the scalp.,"When I used this product the first time it did give me a sense of relief from my itchy scalp but the second night I used it, it irritated it and made it much worse for days. I also did some research on whether or not if you should use witch hazel on your scalp and it specifically said online not to. All because there is a potential risk of irritation, especially if you have sensitive skin."
18,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Dry Scalps,"I’ve always had an incredibly dry scalp and with this stuff, it’s been really amazing.I greatly changed my hair routine from washing every other day, to every 2-3 days. And the day before I use scalp serum, and then shower the next day.Using this, and clarifying conditioner and or shampoo SERIOUSLY helps with flakes!My scalp has literally never been so moisturized.Highly recommend. Will keep buying this great product!"
19,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me.,I got this to help with psoriasis like patches I get on my scalp. The contents are very think with exfoliating beads. I have long think hair and it was difficult for me to get the scrub to where I wanted it on my head while moving my hair around. I really could only exfoliate the edges of my scalp. It almost felt like I needed to do it outside of the shower and section off my hair. Not a fan.
20,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very Gritty,This wasn't a horrible scalp scrub but if you have medium to thick hair it is very difficult to get it to rinse completely out.  My scalp felt itchy after and I kept finding seed type things (I think that this was a part of the exfoliant). The smell wasn't bad but not rinsing clean is definitely a deal breaker for me.
21,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not greasy,I really like this scalp oil it does it’s job in moisturizing the scalp and doesn’t look greasy it’s a very fine oil.
22,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair shiny; not heavily scented.,"I mixed this with my conditioner and left it on FIRST, then did my shampoo, and it made my hair very shiny! However I really wish the scent was stronger. While I bought this hoping that using it would be like a spa experience at home, you can barely smell it."
23,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good!,"It looks good and smell well. I'm not giving it 5 stars as it wasn't what I wanted or like. The sea ​​salt is thick and won't stay in my head to actually be able to rub it and exfoliates my scalp. Maybe other people like it but for me, it didn't do what I was expecting it to do."
24,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosemary mint serum,I really enjoy this product. I love the way my scalp feels after the applications. I love the fragrance and the solution is absorbed very quickly. This product does not leave my hair feeling grease or heavy.

25,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,Don’t waste your money on this product. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing. It contains large chunks of salt that are to big to be effective. Smells nice. But who ever made this product never tried to use it. Very thick and hard to get past hair to your scalp.

27,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,3.0 out of 5 stars,Eh..,"It is very hard to actually get it onto your scalp and I had to use a lot. I only have a chin length bob. It smells good, but the directions are unclear so I won't be buying this again. I feel like the tube would only last 3-4 uses. I didn't notice an effect after using it either."

30,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't help,I bought this to use as an overnight treatment for my itchy/flakey scalp.  I didn't notice any improvement after I washed it out the next morning.  I ended up returning it and buying the Badger jojoba hair oil instead and that worked REALLY well for my issue
31,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Less a scrub, more of a wash",The scrubbing beads in this are HUGE and round. It feels more like rolling small marbles around your head than it does exfoliation. The scent is nice and it foams up well; but it's more like a pre-shampoo. Not enough scrubbing properties.
32,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,Messy and difficult to use,Salt is very large crystals and as you rub into scalp gets allover.  It's very thick and hair needs to be parted into small sections inorder to use.  Not worth the effort
33,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely not.,"Lol this product is wild. Goes on chunky, doesn't spread and big glops if product just fall to the ground and it's wasted. It doesn't scrub unless you physically put pieces on different parts of your scalp, trying to avoid it from falling to the ground.No. Absolutely not. I wish I could get my money back."

35,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad idea,Unfortunately I hated it. It’s difficult to use not mailable enough to be effective. Made a lot of hair come out. Left hair stripped. That’s two items from this company that sounds so ideal that has damaged skin.

37,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for me.,This product did not work for my scalp. Nothing changed and I still had dandruff. It even got worse. I was hoping for a product that I could use after a shower with a cooling effect on the scalp for irritation. I fail to see what the point of putting oil on your scalp can possibly do when you wash it clean two minutes later.
38,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonders!,"As people have said, product does have larger bits of salt and such for scrubbing. At first I did find it hard to get on my actual scalp, but once I got that technique down, I fell in love! This product is amazing. My hair is normally super greasy but I went almost 3 days with no washing and very little dry shampoo after using this scrub. Very pleased with my purchase."

It is hard and not squeezable, so I can't get any of the serum to go into the dropper. It smells good and I am excited to use it but can't get the applicator to work."
42,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth buying,This product did absolutely nothing for my scalp.

82,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,4.0 out of 5 stars,Tricky to use but helpful,"My scalp is incredibly sensitive. I have tried a lot of products over the years to get it to calm down, from prescription Nizoral to tea tree oil to tar shampoo and apple cider vinegar, but it's only cleared up temporarily at best. I saw this and decided to give it a try. The comments about the chunks of salt are on point; the scrub could be pulverized into a much finer paste, and bits of salt literally clinked in the sink when they fell off my scalp. I also found it 100% impossible to use with dry hair - I had to wet my hair so I could part it enough to apply the scrub. Having said that, once I got it in my hair and on my scalp, I was able to scrub it into a bit of a lather (maybe because of the jojoba oil?) and work it into the skin. The effect has been SO satisfying! My scalp is actually clear - free of irritated patches and dandruff - and my hair feels great! I did not shampoo at all, just used a heavy duty conditioner afterward, as the scrub made the hair feel quite dry at first. I am picking little dots of charcoal out of my hair here and there, but that's a small price to pay for not having an oozing, itchy scalp.For future use, I'm going to get some kind of a squirt bottle (like they use for hair dye), add a little warm water to dissolve the larger salt particles, and use it with wet hair. I may coat the length of my hair with coconut oil and let the whole thing sit for awhile, like a deep conditioning treatment. Overall, I wouldn't use this product if you don't have a problem with dandruff/scalp conditions, because of the way the product is formatted, but it is truly useful if you have issues with your scalp."

89,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant Relief,"I have the most incredible itch on my scalp, particulary the back of my head. I'm still trying to figure out if the cause is from the detergent i use on my pillow case, the soap i use, or some sort of infection... I use various oils and lotions for my scalp to relieve the itch, but i know that these things can build up over time, and its best to backtrack on the first product to reach my head, which would be the shampoo. In conjunction to this product, i've tried an apple cider vinegar wash, which made no difference to the severe itch i was having. On that day when i used apple cider vinegar, I had to go back in the shower to wash with the Pacifica scrub, and the minute it touch my scalp, i had instant relif! I sighed as if i was having the best massage. I couldnt believe how immediate i received results. I've used it for two weeks so far, and i'm happy to be relatively itch fee (i occassionally get itchy scalp from laying on my pillow or if i wash my hair with hot water, but i never get itchy if i wash with cooler water and use this product.I'm sad that other customers are having trouble with the large grains of salt. I have slightly textured hair that is very fine, very very dry, and is sparce (my hair follicles are very spaced out, i have excruciatingly thin hair and not at all attractive). So i dont have trouble rinsing out the grains, although i do take a bit longer than normal to fully rinse out everything. Using my nails help with removing the chunks.I do recommend this product and i plan on making this my go-to itch reliever."

97,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,2.0 out of 5 stars,Product is clumpy and difficult to get to my scalp through my hair.,"I tend to get areas of flaky buildup on my scalp at least 1x a month, bought product hoping to eliminate that buildup in one use but found the product did not get to most areas I wanted to reach."
98,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,1.0 out of 5 stars,WORST SCRUB EVER,"The consistency is really weird, it’s gel like but the moment it touches hair it turns into basically a glue which makes it impossible to scrub, not to mention there’s so many plastic beads. Once the gel went away all the beads kept falling out of my hair and made a mess in my bathroom. Not worth anything and completely useless"

100,Pacifica Beauty | Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum + Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub | Gently Exfoliates and Remove Product Buildup | Purify and Revive Your Scalp | 100% Vegan and Cruelty Free,3.0 out of 5 stars,Odor Too Strong,"I had no problem getting this on my scalp.  It seems to do a good job of getting the skin clean and didn’t leave a lot of residue on my head.  Some granules got stuck under my fingernails, but washed out. I found the strong smell to be obnoxious.  It’s like using mouth wash on your hair, and did not blend well with my shampoo.  Fortunately, odor does not linger long.  I use a rosemary conditioner and it smells nothing like this.  I will use up the tube, but will not repurchase."

0,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It's water... underwhelming.,"I was highly anticipating this as a close friend of mine loves Pacifica's products (she hasn't tried this one in particular.) I'm not one to usually go after the latest ""snake oil"", my intentions were really just to have that advertised good smell and maybe feel like my scalp was fresher afterwards. I'm SO disappointed. It's... water. Yes, it's a little slick, there are oils etc in it. It has an herbal smell of some kind (not one I recognize as Rosemary Mint) but only if I practically have my nose in the bottle. I tried this before shampooing as instructed and honestly my hair just felt gross and I couldn't smell or feel anything while massaging into my scalp. I will say the saving grace was that the return process was a breeze. They offered me returnless refund via Amazon credit, which I'm fine with.If Pacifica works for you, great. Maybe this was a weak/bad batch, I don't know. But I will say I had a better smelling and more cleansing experience using my husband's $2 Rosemary Mint Suave shampoo."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it,"This is my first scalp serum. I have very itchy and oily scalp and hoped to find a product that would soothe. I wouldn't say this has a cooling effect, but it makes my roots feel nourished and decreases some build-up. I like to massage one full dropper of serum into my scalp after washing my hair. It leaves absolutely no stickiness or residue."
2,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perky hair overnight,Not sure about the negative reviews.  This product is great!  My hair is perky at the roots and for someone (me) with super fine hair and thingning it makes a huge difference.  I usually do an overnight treatment and today trying an after shower leave in treatment.  Definitely recommend this but you have figure out what works for you as far as treatment.
3,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Relief for itchy scalp. Great for wig wearers!,"I was experiencing itching in the area I wear my wig grip band, and it was driving me up the wall. This product provided relief from a dry irritated scalp. However, I had to use it more frequently than directed.  After a few days of applications and hair washings the itchiness went away."
4,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pacifica produces another GEM!,"This is a hidden gem product. I love Pacifica, but I haven't tried everything they offer. This stuff made an immediate impact on my hair, which is vibrantly colored. It smells fresh and delicious. It's softening, soothing, and refreshing. It just plain works, so don't hesitate to give it a try. As far as I know, you can return it if you don't like it, but I'm hoping you will love it as much as I do."
5,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money.,This scrub has huge pieces of sea salt in the formula but no matter how thoroughly I scrub I can’t feel them. I have short hair too. This product seemed to make my scalp more irritated than anything. The product was not a cohesive scrub it fell apart immediately when it got on my hands. I ended up stepping on more of the product in the shower than what actually ended up on my scalp.
6,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too chunky,"This smells really nice, but doesn't seem to do much scrubbing, as the particles are quite coarse and there aren't many of them to begin with. It seemed like 3 or 4 chunks of salt per square inch of scalp."
7,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,This contains small rocks.,This scalp scrub has rocks in it.  I have thick hair and it was hard to wash all the rocks out of my hair.  I had my hair up at work. My scalp was itchy and sore. I had a small rock still stuck in my hair near my scalp.
8,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Has my scalp free of ingrown hairs,"After years of painful ingrown hairs on back of my scalp, my Barber recommended this due to her personal experience. I bought it doubting my lifelong problem would be fixed. One use and my scalp looked and felt COMPLETELY different within two weeks. Now, me, my barber as well as the shop owner recommend this to everyone they meet who has ingrown hairs on their scalp. It’s better than any of the other 5 products I own."
9,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use & helped my dry, itchy scalp.","I have been using this a few nights a week for about a month as an overnight scalp treatment. It has a thin, viscous texture. The texture and ingredients are fairly similar to a basic facial serum (hyaluronic acid, b5,aloe, witch hazel). I apply 4 droppers full in lines over my scalp from front to back, then massage it gently into the scalp and comb the residue through my roots before bed. In the am I shower as usual. This winter had been pretty hard on my skin in general with me needing extra thick moisturizers on my full arms and legs as opposed to just my knees and elbows. This has really helped with my dry, itchy scalp. I don't think this serum would work for a scalp condition like dandruff that needs medication; but for just a dry scalp it really made a difference. I took a star off for the poor dropper. It seems to have trouble pulling the product from the container."
10,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,PAIN to use!!,"This stuff is a PAIN to use! It is HARD to get down into the roots and the salt grains are HUGE, they just roll off of your head! If the salt crystals were 1/4 the size, it would be much easier to use. It smells great, but the poor instructions on the tube dont explain how to use it to get the most benefit."
11,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Pacifica Addition,I’ve been looking for a product to clear my crown chakra and this does the trick with sage. It soothes and hydrates the scalp just like a spa treatment. Simply massage into scalp then shampoo out or leave in overnight.
12,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Impressed,Like many others were saying this product isn't right. I was surprised the beads weren't water dissolvable. So you get it in your hair and it is a pain to get out. AVOID if you have thick or a lot of hair. My hair is short and all the way thru shampooing and conditioning I was still picking out those little beads. It smells like tea tree oil but a little lighter so that wasn't bad. It is not an easy product to work with overall. I wouldn't recommend.
13,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"Like other reviews have said, its really hard to get a good scrub out if this. It’s too chunky & doesn't get to your scalp easily. I made sure to follow instructions with sectioning my hair but it still just ended up in my hair & not my scalp. I used the whole bottle to try & give it a fair shot but it’s not worth repurchasing. Plus it runs out too fast.The only reason for the 2 star was the smell & “minty” feeling it gives my hair."
14,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It smells great! Wish it worked better,I have a lot of build up on my scalp similar to psoriasis. I get a lot of flakes and then oily patches. I bought this to help as a pre treatment to break up the patches. It smelled great and loved the way it felt on my scalp. Not sure it made much a differece on my scalp even after using as an overnight treatment.
15,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pacifica,I really enjoyed using this. It has a very light scent and is really great when using to massage the scalp. I know it says only to use 3 to 4 drops but it requires a few more than that be able to distribute throughout your scalp. Other than that it is marvelous.
16,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for scalp, works for me.",This product smells great and I use it once a week to help with dry scalp and build up. So far no complaints.
17,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Witch hazel is not for the scalp.,"When I used this product the first time it did give me a sense of relief from my itchy scalp but the second night I used it, it irritated it and made it much worse for days. I also did some research on whether or not if you should use witch hazel on your scalp and it specifically said online not to. All because there is a potential risk of irritation, especially if you have sensitive skin."
18,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Dry Scalps,"I’ve always had an incredibly dry scalp and with this stuff, it’s been really amazing.I greatly changed my hair routine from washing every other day, to every 2-3 days. And the day before I use scalp serum, and then shower the next day.Using this, and clarifying conditioner and or shampoo SERIOUSLY helps with flakes!My scalp has literally never been so moisturized.Highly recommend. Will keep buying this great product!"
19,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me.,I got this to help with psoriasis like patches I get on my scalp. The contents are very think with exfoliating beads. I have long think hair and it was difficult for me to get the scrub to where I wanted it on my head while moving my hair around. I really could only exfoliate the edges of my scalp. It almost felt like I needed to do it outside of the shower and section off my hair. Not a fan.
20,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very Gritty,This wasn't a horrible scalp scrub but if you have medium to thick hair it is very difficult to get it to rinse completely out.  My scalp felt itchy after and I kept finding seed type things (I think that this was a part of the exfoliant). The smell wasn't bad but not rinsing clean is definitely a deal breaker for me.
21,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not greasy,I really like this scalp oil it does it’s job in moisturizing the scalp and doesn’t look greasy it’s a very fine oil.
22,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair shiny; not heavily scented.,"I mixed this with my conditioner and left it on FIRST, then did my shampoo, and it made my hair very shiny! However I really wish the scent was stronger. While I bought this hoping that using it would be like a spa experience at home, you can barely smell it."
23,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good!,"It looks good and smell well. I'm not giving it 5 stars as it wasn't what I wanted or like. The sea ​​salt is thick and won't stay in my head to actually be able to rub it and exfoliates my scalp. Maybe other people like it but for me, it didn't do what I was expecting it to do."
24,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosemary mint serum,I really enjoy this product. I love the way my scalp feels after the applications. I love the fragrance and the solution is absorbed very quickly. This product does not leave my hair feeling grease or heavy. I follow the Korean Ten Step Hair Routine and for the number of products used this is perfect.
25,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,Don’t waste your money on this product. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing. It contains large chunks of salt that are to big to be effective. Smells nice. But who ever made this product never tried to use it. Very thick and hard to get past hair to your scalp.
26,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Soothing,"Works great! I received it quickly and it soothes the scalp. My scalp gets irritated, so this helps calm it. I just wish they made it in a leave in formula for the week.  Or even as a daily use! Thank you!"
27,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Eh..,"It is very hard to actually get it onto your scalp and I had to use a lot. I only have a chin length bob. It smells good, but the directions are unclear so I won't be buying this again. I feel like the tube would only last 3-4 uses. I didn't notice an effect after using it either."
28,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Amazing!,"This feels so good on my scalp! It does not burn, I can leave it on for hours or just a few before a shower. This product cleared buildup and has prevented my hair from being so oily between washes. Will buy again!"
29,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for fine hair,"I started using this product a few months back, however, the store I bought it from is no longer carrying it.  I love the scent and how it makes my scalp feel after using it.  My hair, which has grown more fine now that I'm older also has more body to it.  Thanks again Amazon...I knew you'd come through for me!"
30,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't help,I bought this to use as an overnight treatment for my itchy/flakey scalp.  I didn't notice any improvement after I washed it out the next morning.  I ended up returning it and buying the Badger jojoba hair oil instead and that worked REALLY well for my issue
31,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Less a scrub, more of a wash",The scrubbing beads in this are HUGE and round. It feels more like rolling small marbles around your head than it does exfoliation. The scent is nice and it foams up well; but it's more like a pre-shampoo. Not enough scrubbing properties.
32,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Messy and difficult to use,Salt is very large crystals and as you rub into scalp gets allover.  It's very thick and hair needs to be parted into small sections inorder to use.  Not worth the effort
33,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely not.,"Lol this product is wild. Goes on chunky, doesn't spread and big glops if product just fall to the ground and it's wasted. It doesn't scrub unless you physically put pieces on different parts of your scalp, trying to avoid it from falling to the ground.No. Absolutely not. I wish I could get my money back."
34,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really helps clean scalp,"I have scalp psoriasis and i can't wash my hair daily because it irritates my scalp, this scrub helps clean and calm inflammation for me. Good product."
35,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad idea,Unfortunately I hated it. It’s difficult to use not mailable enough to be effective. Made a lot of hair come out. Left hair stripped. That’s two items from this company that sounds so ideal that has damaged skin.
36,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,It's okay,"I bought it for my dry scalp. Didn't work. It did however feel pretty good when I was applying it and had it sitting on my scalp, so I give it 2 stars for that. But that's about it."
37,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for me.,This product did not work for my scalp. Nothing changed and I still had dandruff. It even got worse. I was hoping for a product that I could use after a shower with a cooling effect on the scalp for irritation. I fail to see what the point of putting oil on your scalp can possibly do when you wash it clean two minutes later.
38,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonders!,"As people have said, product does have larger bits of salt and such for scrubbing. At first I did find it hard to get on my actual scalp, but once I got that technique down, I fell in love! This product is amazing. My hair is normally super greasy but I went almost 3 days with no washing and very little dry shampoo after using this scrub. Very pleased with my purchase."
39,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps my seborrheic dermatitis,I massage my scalp with this oil before I wash my hair. The scent is very pleasant. The oil is super light weight and helps with itchy scalp and seborrheic dermatitis
40,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Scalp Care,I liked it bc of the ingredients and I was looking for something that would give my scalp a boost. It’s a good serum not oily at all. I use it every other day on the day I wash my hair. I wish it had a spa like scent.
41,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The dropper doesn't work - can't get any product in the dropper.,"I don't know why but the rubber end of the dropper where you are supposed to squeeze doesn't work. It is hard and not squeezable, so I can't get any of the serum to go into the dropper. It smells good and I am excited to use it but can't get the applicator to work."
42,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth buying,This product did absolutely nothing for my scalp. It made it worst by making my hair drop. I don’t recommend this to anyone who wants scalp relief. The ingredients is water down and smells like nothing. No potent oil or herbs of rosemary. Please save your money and research further. I couldn’t get a refund for this item.
43,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Really good for the price. It’s my first scalp exfoliator so I think it’s a great one. You can feel the difference in your hair after you’ve used it. I would definitely buy again
44,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,So refreshing on scalp,This scrub is awesome. I have Seborrheic dermatitis and this really helps clear the build up and excess oils that the scalp can accumulate on a daily basis. It's refreshing and has a nice mint smell also!
45,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Item opened in package,"I have not used the product yet and while I am excited to try it, the top was off the product and some of the contents spilled into the package. Granted, the package smelled really good, but I am unsure why the item was open. I know the driver had nothing to do with that."
46,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"I sporadically experience an itchy scalp. Product buildup, dryness and sensitivity also affects me seasonally. This is really soothing, smells divine and definitely helps."

77,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,disappointed,I usually love Pacifica products but this one was disappointing. The tube was 90% air and the product was overall very underwhelming.
78,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Great,It’s hard to get it to your scalp with a lot of hair

80,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Came with top unscrewed and seemed as if half of contents was gone.,I was concerned to even use it with the top left off.
81,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,So awesome!,Works great!
82,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Tricky to use but helpful,"My scalp is incredibly sensitive. I have tried a lot of products over the years to get it to calm down, from prescription Nizoral to tea tree oil to tar shampoo and apple cider vinegar, but it's only cleared up temporarily at best. I saw this and decided to give it a try. The comments about the chunks of salt are on point; the scrub could be pulverized into a much finer paste, and bits of salt literally clinked in the sink when they fell off my scalp. I also found it 100% impossible to use with dry hair - I had to wet my hair so I could part it enough to apply the scrub. Having said that, once I got it in my hair and on my scalp, I was able to scrub it into a bit of a lather (maybe because of the jojoba oil?) and work it into the skin. The effect has been SO satisfying! My scalp is actually clear - free of irritated patches and dandruff - and my hair feels great! I did not shampoo at all, just used a heavy duty conditioner afterward, as the scrub made the hair feel quite dry at first. I am picking little dots of charcoal out of my hair here and there, but that's a small price to pay for not having an oozing, itchy scalp.For future use, I'm going to get some kind of a squirt bottle (like they use for hair dye), add a little warm water to dissolve the larger salt particles, and use it with wet hair. I may coat the length of my hair with coconut oil and let the whole thing sit for awhile, like a deep conditioning treatment. Overall, I wouldn't use this product if you don't have a problem with dandruff/scalp conditions, because of the way the product is formatted, but it is truly useful if you have issues with your scalp."
83,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,How is rock salt good for your hair?,"The chunks of salt in this could be put in a salt grinder they are so big!  This would not feel good on any part of your body. let alone on your scalp, it seems like it would be more damaging to your hair by breaking it. And cutting it."
84,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Non-greasy and definitely helps with scalp itching/flaking,I love this product! The first time I tried it I felt it didn’t do anything but it definitely doesn’t work over night. I gave it a second chance and have been using it consistently for months now and I love it! I notice a difference in my scalp itchiness on nights I skip it.
85,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work,"I have sensitive skin, and this formula irritated my scalp to the point of breakout."
86,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work for me,Didn’t do much for me. It made my scalp dry up even more.
87,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for short hair mostly,So this is best used for shorter hair definitely which I have. It's great for after a fresh hair cut to remove all the tiny bits and pieces.
88,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Huge salt chunks and it doesn't work very well,The salt is incredibly thick and hard to rinse out.Not that great. Bummer
89,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant Relief,"I have the most incredible itch on my scalp, particulary the back of my head. I'm still trying to figure out if the cause is from the detergent i use on my pillow case, the soap i use, or some sort of infection... I use various oils and lotions for my scalp to relieve the itch, but i know that these things can build up over time, and its best to backtrack on the first product to reach my head, which would be the shampoo. In conjunction to this product, i've tried an apple cider vinegar wash, which made no difference to the severe itch i was having. On that day when i used apple cider vinegar, I had to go back in the shower to wash with the Pacifica scrub, and the minute it touch my scalp, i had instant relif! I sighed as if i was having the best massage. I couldnt believe how immediate i received results. I've used it for two weeks so far, and i'm happy to be relatively itch fee (i occassionally get itchy scalp from laying on my pillow or if i wash my hair with hot water, but i never get itchy if i wash with cooler water and use this product.I'm sad that other customers are having trouble with the large grains of salt. I have slightly textured hair that is very fine, very very dry, and is sparce (my hair follicles are very spaced out, i have excruciatingly thin hair and not at all attractive). So i dont have trouble rinsing out the grains, although i do take a bit longer than normal to fully rinse out everything. Using my nails help with removing the chunks.I do recommend this product and i plan on making this my go-to itch reliever."
90,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible for curls,Hate is a strong word but I really really dislike this product for my hair. I’ve been finding micro beads in my scalp for DAYS!
91,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loveee,"I love this so much if you ever have an itchy scalp I recommend this so much. I use it every other wash or once a week and follow with my love beauty and planet scalp serum after I get out of the shower. The combo is so refreshing and the scrub feels so good. The texture of my scalp feels nicer as well as my hair, and I think the scrub has encouraged growth as well."
92,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells and feels nice almost,Really like the smell and the scrubbing texture. I don't really love that some bits stay behind on the hair. Beads? But it's supposed to be rice and salt?
93,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful scalp scrub,This is a wonderful scalp scrub. It works well but is hard to get through hair to the scalp. It has a nice refreshing scent. I tried another name brand scrub but it was no where near as good.
94,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I love the way this makes my scalp feel and cleanses the styling product residue making my hair soft and shiny
95,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake product.,I think I received a fake product. Mine has absolutely no scent whatsoever and the consistency is water like.
96,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"May work best for fine, thin hair types","Works great for my fine, thin hair. It’s a little chunky when first applied but add a touch more water and it gives a good lather to move the exfoliants around. Smells lovely.  Rinses out great. My hair is super soft and clean afterwards."
97,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Product is clumpy and difficult to get to my scalp through my hair.,"I tend to get areas of flaky buildup on my scalp at least 1x a month, bought product hoping to eliminate that buildup in one use but found the product did not get to most areas I wanted to reach."
98,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,WORST SCRUB EVER,"The consistency is really weird, it’s gel like but the moment it touches hair it turns into basically a glue which makes it impossible to scrub, not to mention there’s so many plastic beads. Once the gel went away all the beads kept falling out of my hair and made a mess in my bathroom. Not worth anything and completely useless"
99,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Would not buy again,Not a very good scent. You can barely smell anything. Not worth pay g money for this product.
100,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Odor Too Strong,"I had no problem getting this on my scalp.  It seems to do a good job of getting the skin clean and didn’t leave a lot of residue on my head.  Some granules got stuck under my fingernails, but washed out. I found the strong smell to be obnoxious.  It’s like using mouth wash on your hair, and did not blend well with my shampoo.  Fortunately, odor does not linger long.  I use a rosemary conditioner and it smells nothing like this.  I will use up the tube, but will not repurchase."
101,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for dry scalp!,I liked this so much I reordered . My scalp was feeling dry and itching . Bought this and it took care of the problem .

103,"Pacifica Beauty Scalp Love Rosemary Mint Serum Purifies Revives Scalp Vegan CrueltyFree, Clear, 2 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight,I love the scent and the feel of it on my scalp
0,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It's water... underwhelming.,"I was highly anticipating this as a close friend of mine loves Pacifica's products (she hasn't tried this one in particular.) I'm not one to usually go after the latest ""snake oil"", my intentions were really just to have that advertised good smell and maybe feel like my scalp was fresher afterwards. I'm SO disappointed. It's... water. Yes, it's a little slick, there are oils etc in it. It has an herbal smell of some kind (not one I recognize as Rosemary Mint) but only if I practically have my nose in the bottle. I tried this before shampooing as instructed and honestly my hair just felt gross and I couldn't smell or feel anything while massaging into my scalp. I will say the saving grace was that the return process was a breeze. They offered me returnless refund via Amazon credit, which I'm fine with.If Pacifica works for you, great. Maybe this was a weak/bad batch, I don't know. But I will say I had a better smelling and more cleansing experience using my husband's $2 Rosemary Mint Suave shampoo."
1,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it,"This is my first scalp serum. I have very itchy and oily scalp and hoped to find a product that would soothe. I wouldn't say this has a cooling effect, but it makes my roots feel nourished and decreases some build-up. I like to massage one full dropper of serum into my scalp after washing my hair. It leaves absolutely no stickiness or residue."
2,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perky hair overnight,Not sure about the negative reviews.  This product is great!  My hair is perky at the roots and for someone (me) with super fine hair and thingning it makes a huge difference.  I usually do an overnight treatment and today trying an after shower leave in treatment.  Definitely recommend this but you have figure out what works for you as far as treatment.
3,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Relief for itchy scalp. Great for wig wearers!,"I was experiencing itching in the area I wear my wig grip band, and it was driving me up the wall. This product provided relief from a dry irritated scalp. However, I had to use it more frequently than directed.  After a few days of applications and hair washings the itchiness went away."
4,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pacifica produces another GEM!,"This is a hidden gem product. I love Pacifica, but I haven't tried everything they offer. This stuff made an immediate impact on my hair, which is vibrantly colored. It smells fresh and delicious. It's softening, soothing, and refreshing. It just plain works, so don't hesitate to give it a try. As far as I know, you can return it if you don't like it, but I'm hoping you will love it as much as I do."
5,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money.,This scrub has huge pieces of sea salt in the formula but no matter how thoroughly I scrub I can’t feel them. I have short hair too. This product seemed to make my scalp more irritated than anything. The product was not a cohesive scrub it fell apart immediately when it got on my hands. I ended up stepping on more of the product in the shower than what actually ended up on my scalp.
6,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too chunky,"This smells really nice, but doesn't seem to do much scrubbing, as the particles are quite coarse and there aren't many of them to begin with. It seemed like 3 or 4 chunks of salt per square inch of scalp."
7,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,This contains small rocks.,This scalp scrub has rocks in it.  I have thick hair and it was hard to wash all the rocks out of my hair.  I had my hair up at work. My scalp was itchy and sore. I had a small rock still stuck in my hair near my scalp.
8,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Has my scalp free of ingrown hairs,"After years of painful ingrown hairs on back of my scalp, my Barber recommended this due to her personal experience. I bought it doubting my lifelong problem would be fixed. One use and my scalp looked and felt COMPLETELY different within two weeks. Now, me, my barber as well as the shop owner recommend this to everyone they meet who has ingrown hairs on their scalp. It’s better than any of the other 5 products I own."
9,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use & helped my dry, itchy scalp.","I have been using this a few nights a week for about a month as an overnight scalp treatment. It has a thin, viscous texture. The texture and ingredients are fairly similar to a basic facial serum (hyaluronic acid, b5,aloe, witch hazel). I apply 4 droppers full in lines over my scalp from front to back, then massage it gently into the scalp and comb the residue through my roots before bed. In the am I shower as usual. This winter had been pretty hard on my skin in general with me needing extra thick moisturizers on my full arms and legs as opposed to just my knees and elbows. This has really helped with my dry, itchy scalp. I don't think this serum would work for a scalp condition like dandruff that needs medication; but for just a dry scalp it really made a difference. I took a star off for the poor dropper. It seems to have trouble pulling the product from the container."
10,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,PAIN to use!!,"This stuff is a PAIN to use! It is HARD to get down into the roots and the salt grains are HUGE, they just roll off of your head! If the salt crystals were 1/4 the size, it would be much easier to use. It smells great, but the poor instructions on the tube dont explain how to use it to get the most benefit."
11,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Pacifica Addition,I’ve been looking for a product to clear my crown chakra and this does the trick with sage. It soothes and hydrates the scalp just like a spa treatment. Simply massage into scalp then shampoo out or leave in overnight.
12,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Impressed,Like many others were saying this product isn't right. I was surprised the beads weren't water dissolvable. So you get it in your hair and it is a pain to get out. AVOID if you have thick or a lot of hair. My hair is short and all the way thru shampooing and conditioning I was still picking out those little beads. It smells like tea tree oil but a little lighter so that wasn't bad. It is not an easy product to work with overall. I wouldn't recommend.
13,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"Like other reviews have said, its really hard to get a good scrub out if this. It’s too chunky & doesn't get to your scalp easily. I made sure to follow instructions with sectioning my hair but it still just ended up in my hair & not my scalp. I used the whole bottle to try & give it a fair shot but it’s not worth repurchasing. Plus it runs out too fast.The only reason for the 2 star was the smell & “minty” feeling it gives my hair."
14,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It smells great! Wish it worked better,I have a lot of build up on my scalp similar to psoriasis. I get a lot of flakes and then oily patches. I bought this to help as a pre treatment to break up the patches. It smelled great and loved the way it felt on my scalp. Not sure it made much a differece on my scalp even after using as an overnight treatment.
15,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pacifica,I really enjoyed using this. It has a very light scent and is really great when using to massage the scalp. I know it says only to use 3 to 4 drops but it requires a few more than that be able to distribute throughout your scalp. Other than that it is marvelous.
16,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for scalp, works for me.",This product smells great and I use it once a week to help with dry scalp and build up. So far no complaints.
17,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Witch hazel is not for the scalp.,"When I used this product the first time it did give me a sense of relief from my itchy scalp but the second night I used it, it irritated it and made it much worse for days. I also did some research on whether or not if you should use witch hazel on your scalp and it specifically said online not to. All because there is a potential risk of irritation, especially if you have sensitive skin."
18,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Dry Scalps,"I’ve always had an incredibly dry scalp and with this stuff, it’s been really amazing.I greatly changed my hair routine from washing every other day, to every 2-3 days. And the day before I use scalp serum, and then shower the next day.Using this, and clarifying conditioner and or shampoo SERIOUSLY helps with flakes!My scalp has literally never been so moisturized.Highly recommend. Will keep buying this great product!"
19,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me.,I got this to help with psoriasis like patches I get on my scalp. The contents are very think with exfoliating beads. I have long think hair and it was difficult for me to get the scrub to where I wanted it on my head while moving my hair around. I really could only exfoliate the edges of my scalp. It almost felt like I needed to do it outside of the shower and section off my hair. Not a fan.
20,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very Gritty,This wasn't a horrible scalp scrub but if you have medium to thick hair it is very difficult to get it to rinse completely out.  My scalp felt itchy after and I kept finding seed type things (I think that this was a part of the exfoliant). The smell wasn't bad but not rinsing clean is definitely a deal breaker for me.
21,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not greasy,I really like this scalp oil it does it’s job in moisturizing the scalp and doesn’t look greasy it’s a very fine oil.
22,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair shiny; not heavily scented.,"I mixed this with my conditioner and left it on FIRST, then did my shampoo, and it made my hair very shiny! However I really wish the scent was stronger. While I bought this hoping that using it would be like a spa experience at home, you can barely smell it."
23,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good!,"It looks good and smell well. I'm not giving it 5 stars as it wasn't what I wanted or like. The sea ​​salt is thick and won't stay in my head to actually be able to rub it and exfoliates my scalp. Maybe other people like it but for me, it didn't do what I was expecting it to do."
24,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosemary mint serum,I really enjoy this product. I love the way my scalp feels after the applications. I love the fragrance and the solution is absorbed very quickly. This product does not leave my hair feeling grease or heavy. I follow the Korean Ten Step Hair Routine and for the number of products used this is perfect.
25,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,Don’t waste your money on this product. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing. It contains large chunks of salt that are to big to be effective. Smells nice. But who ever made this product never tried to use it. Very thick and hard to get past hair to your scalp.
26,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Soothing,"Works great! I received it quickly and it soothes the scalp. My scalp gets irritated, so this helps calm it. I just wish they made it in a leave in formula for the week.  Or even as a daily use! Thank you!"
27,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Eh..,"It is very hard to actually get it onto your scalp and I had to use a lot. I only have a chin length bob. It smells good, but the directions are unclear so I won't be buying this again. I feel like the tube would only last 3-4 uses. I didn't notice an effect after using it either."
28,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Amazing!,"This feels so good on my scalp! It does not burn, I can leave it on for hours or just a few before a shower. This product cleared buildup and has prevented my hair from being so oily between washes. Will buy again!"
29,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for fine hair,"I started using this product a few months back, however, the store I bought it from is no longer carrying it.  I love the scent and how it makes my scalp feel after using it.  My hair, which has grown more fine now that I'm older also has more body to it.  Thanks again Amazon...I knew you'd come through for me!"
30,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't help,I bought this to use as an overnight treatment for my itchy/flakey scalp.  I didn't notice any improvement after I washed it out the next morning.  I ended up returning it and buying the Badger jojoba hair oil instead and that worked REALLY well for my issue
31,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Less a scrub, more of a wash",The scrubbing beads in this are HUGE and round. It feels more like rolling small marbles around your head than it does exfoliation. The scent is nice and it foams up well; but it's more like a pre-shampoo. Not enough scrubbing properties.
32,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Messy and difficult to use,Salt is very large crystals and as you rub into scalp gets allover.  It's very thick and hair needs to be parted into small sections inorder to use.  Not worth the effort
33,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely not.,"Lol this product is wild. Goes on chunky, doesn't spread and big glops if product just fall to the ground and it's wasted. It doesn't scrub unless you physically put pieces on different parts of your scalp, trying to avoid it from falling to the ground.No. Absolutely not. I wish I could get my money back."
34,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really helps clean scalp,"I have scalp psoriasis and i can't wash my hair daily because it irritates my scalp, this scrub helps clean and calm inflammation for me. Good product."
35,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad idea,Unfortunately I hated it. It’s difficult to use not mailable enough to be effective. Made a lot of hair come out. Left hair stripped. That’s two items from this company that sounds so ideal that has damaged skin.
36,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,It's okay,"I bought it for my dry scalp. Didn't work. It did however feel pretty good when I was applying it and had it sitting on my scalp, so I give it 2 stars for that. But that's about it."
37,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for me.,This product did not work for my scalp. Nothing changed and I still had dandruff. It even got worse. I was hoping for a product that I could use after a shower with a cooling effect on the scalp for irritation. I fail to see what the point of putting oil on your scalp can possibly do when you wash it clean two minutes later.
38,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonders!,"As people have said, product does have larger bits of salt and such for scrubbing. At first I did find it hard to get on my actual scalp, but once I got that technique down, I fell in love! This product is amazing. My hair is normally super greasy but I went almost 3 days with no washing and very little dry shampoo after using this scrub. Very pleased with my purchase."

40,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Scalp Care,I liked it bc of the ingredients and I was looking for something that would give my scalp a boost. It’s a good serum not oily at all. I use it every other day on the day I wash my hair. I wish it had a spa like scent.
41,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The dropper doesn't work - can't get any product in the dropper.,"I don't know why but the rubber end of the dropper where you are supposed to squeeze doesn't work. It is hard and not squeezable, so I can't get any of the serum to go into the dropper. It smells good and I am excited to use it but can't get the applicator to work."
42,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth buying,This product did absolutely nothing for my scalp. It made it worst by making my hair drop. I don’t recommend this to anyone who wants scalp relief. The ingredients is water down and smells like nothing. No potent oil or herbs of rosemary. Please save your money and research further. I couldn’t get a refund for this item.

77,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,disappointed,I usually love Pacifica products but this one was disappointing. The tube was 90% air and the product was overall very underwhelming.
78,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Great,It’s hard to get it to your scalp with a lot of hair

81,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,So awesome!,Works great!
82,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Tricky to use but helpful,"My scalp is incredibly sensitive. I have tried a lot of products over the years to get it to calm down, from prescription Nizoral to tea tree oil to tar shampoo and apple cider vinegar, but it's only cleared up temporarily at best. I saw this and decided to give it a try. The comments about the chunks of salt are on point; the scrub could be pulverized into a much finer paste, and bits of salt literally clinked in the sink when they fell off my scalp. I also found it 100% impossible to use with dry hair - I had to wet my hair so I could part it enough to apply the scrub. Having said that, once I got it in my hair and on my scalp, I was able to scrub it into a bit of a lather (maybe because of the jojoba oil?) and work it into the skin. The effect has been SO satisfying! My scalp is actually clear - free of irritated patches and dandruff - and my hair feels great! I did not shampoo at all, just used a heavy duty conditioner afterward, as the scrub made the hair feel quite dry at first. I am picking little dots of charcoal out of my hair here and there, but that's a small price to pay for not having an oozing, itchy scalp.For future use, I'm going to get some kind of a squirt bottle (like they use for hair dye), add a little warm water to dissolve the larger salt particles, and use it with wet hair. I may coat the length of my hair with coconut oil and let the whole thing sit for awhile, like a deep conditioning treatment. Overall, I wouldn't use this product if you don't have a problem with dandruff/scalp conditions, because of the way the product is formatted, but it is truly useful if you have issues with your scalp."
83,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,How is rock salt good for your hair?,"The chunks of salt in this could be put in a salt grinder they are so big!  This would not feel good on any part of your body. let alone on your scalp, it seems like it would be more damaging to your hair by breaking it. And cutting it."
84,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Non-greasy and definitely helps with scalp itching/flaking,I love this product! The first time I tried it I felt it didn’t do anything but it definitely doesn’t work over night. I gave it a second chance and have been using it consistently for months now and I love it! I notice a difference in my scalp itchiness on nights I skip it.
85,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work,"I have sensitive skin, and this formula irritated my scalp to the point of breakout."

87,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for short hair mostly,So this is best used for shorter hair definitely which I have. It's great for after a fresh hair cut to remove all the tiny bits and pieces.
88,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Huge salt chunks and it doesn't work very well,The salt is incredibly thick and hard to rinse out.Not that great. Bummer
89,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant Relief,"I have the most incredible itch on my scalp, particulary the back of my head. I'm still trying to figure out if the cause is from the detergent i use on my pillow case, the soap i use, or some sort of infection... I use various oils and lotions for my scalp to relieve the itch, but i know that these things can build up over time, and its best to backtrack on the first product to reach my head, which would be the shampoo. In conjunction to this product, i've tried an apple cider vinegar wash, which made no difference to the severe itch i was having. On that day when i used apple cider vinegar, I had to go back in the shower to wash with the Pacifica scrub, and the minute it touch my scalp, i had instant relif! I sighed as if i was having the best massage. I couldnt believe how immediate i received results. I've used it for two weeks so far, and i'm happy to be relatively itch fee (i occassionally get itchy scalp from laying on my pillow or if i wash my hair with hot water, but i never get itchy if i wash with cooler water and use this product.I'm sad that other customers are having trouble with the large grains of salt. I have slightly textured hair that is very fine, very very dry, and is sparce (my hair follicles are very spaced out, i have excruciatingly thin hair and not at all attractive). So i dont have trouble rinsing out the grains, although i do take a bit longer than normal to fully rinse out everything. Using my nails help with removing the chunks.I do recommend this product and i plan on making this my go-to itch reliever."
90,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible for curls,Hate is a strong word but I really really dislike this product for my hair. I’ve been finding micro beads in my scalp for DAYS!
91,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loveee,"I love this so much if you ever have an itchy scalp I recommend this so much. I use it every other wash or once a week and follow with my love beauty and planet scalp serum after I get out of the shower. The combo is so refreshing and the scrub feels so good. The texture of my scalp feels nicer as well as my hair, and I think the scrub has encouraged growth as well."
92,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells and feels nice almost,Really like the smell and the scrubbing texture. I don't really love that some bits stay behind on the hair. Beads? But it's supposed to be rice and salt?
93,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful scalp scrub,This is a wonderful scalp scrub. It works well but is hard to get through hair to the scalp. It has a nice refreshing scent. I tried another name brand scrub but it was no where near as good.
94,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I love the way this makes my scalp feel and cleanses the styling product residue making my hair soft and shiny
95,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake product.,I think I received a fake product. Mine has absolutely no scent whatsoever and the consistency is water like.
96,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"May work best for fine, thin hair types","Works great for my fine, thin hair. It’s a little chunky when first applied but add a touch more water and it gives a good lather to move the exfoliants around. Smells lovely.  Rinses out great. My hair is super soft and clean afterwards."
97,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Product is clumpy and difficult to get to my scalp through my hair.,"I tend to get areas of flaky buildup on my scalp at least 1x a month, bought product hoping to eliminate that buildup in one use but found the product did not get to most areas I wanted to reach."
98,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,WORST SCRUB EVER,"The consistency is really weird, it’s gel like but the moment it touches hair it turns into basically a glue which makes it impossible to scrub, not to mention there’s so many plastic beads. Once the gel went away all the beads kept falling out of my hair and made a mess in my bathroom. Not worth anything and completely useless"
99,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Would not buy again,Not a very good scent. You can barely smell anything. Not worth pay g money for this product.
100,"Pacifica Beauty Rosemary Detox Scalp Scrub, For All Hair Types, Vegan & Cruelty Free, 4 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Odor Too Strong,"I had no problem getting this on my scalp.  It seems to do a good job of getting the skin clean and didn’t leave a lot of residue on my head.  Some granules got stuck under my fingernails, but washed out. I found the strong smell to be obnoxious.  It’s like using mouth wash on your hair, and did not blend well with my shampoo.  Fortunately, odor does not linger long.  I use a rosemary conditioner and it smells nothing like this.  I will use up the tube, but will not repurchase."

It lathers up super nice and spreads through my hair very good. The conditioner didn't automatically soak into my hair the way most do. I clipped it up when I washed my body and when I was done with my body I unclipped my hair to the conditioner super soaked up and my hair felt soft after rinsing. It leaves all the right stuff to your hair. It smells more vanilla like and is lovely. My blonde(natural) is looking great. The purple is very rich in color

I have tried many shampoos and even Wella toners and nothing ever worked. Hair kept being yellow. I picked up this at Marshalls by accident and let me tell you: IT WORKS. I was surprised with the results.It dries out your hair a little so, using another product to treat the hair is a must but for the color 100% efficient."

It also made my blonde even lighter! After two washes my blonde in like platinum! Beware, it will dry out your hair so what I do is mix the purple conditioner with my normal conditioner. Also the use of hair masks helps while using this product. Even though it is drying I will always choose this purple shampoo."

0,"Pacifica Beauty Vegan Silk Shampoo + Conditioner Set, Vanilla, Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Vitamin B for Dry and Damaged Hair, Hydration, Shine, Silky Smooth, Clean Hair Care, 20 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves Hair Soft & Healthy,"I am very sensitive to synthetic fragrances, so for me to find a good shampoo and conditioner is a challenge. The brand I have used for the last 20 years switched up their formula and I had to stop using it. After trying many of Pacifica’s products I went with their vegan silk line. I now have it on a subscription to come once a month. I use a lot of shampoo and conditioner as I have very thick yet fine hair but it lasts plenty. It has a very mild vanilla scent which works well for me, if one wishes for something with more scent I would recommend their rosemary mint, their beach waves (smells like banana) or their rose scented shampoo and conditioner as they will leave ones hair equally soft but with more scent to them.So happy to have found Pacifica though, for the first time in 20 years I have also been able to wear perfume as their brand uses all natural fragrances. I am so stoked."
