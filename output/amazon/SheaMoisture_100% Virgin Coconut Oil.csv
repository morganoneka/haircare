1,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This coconut oil is bright yellow , seems to have gone bad .","I've purchased Shea moisture extra virgin coconut oil a few times and never have I opened it to find that once it liquefies to be such a bright yellow color with no smell at all.  This is my first time purchasing it from Amazon and I'm not pleased with this at all. Any other place I've purchased this ( Walgreens , Walmart, Target etc) it has always been white with maybe a slight creamy yellowish tint with a faint coconut smell. This jar I purchased from Amazon is clearly very yellow , chunky blobs even though it has all turned liquid and has no smell at all. It worries me that this jar of Shea moisture is either counterfeit or it's going bad."
2,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,5.0 out of 5 stars,For DRY and Healthier Glowing Skin,"For two years, I have been using this coconut oil. I also use this same oil for my 8 year old hair and body. It is not sticky neither it has any smell. It is great for anyone who has dry skin like me. Try to use this oil once you get out from the shower and it will blend perfectly in your skin."
3,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great skin moisturizer for my skin!,"I am African American and love supporting black business. I love buying products that are cruelty free to animals. This product is vegan. I was concerned after reading the reviews about the jar leaking in the box before it was delivered to customer's address. When I received my package, it was almost getting ready to leak through the box. Luckly my package arrived in less than two days. The company should wrap this product in bubble wrap in the future, to stop it from leaking on other items in the box. I was lucky that I dodged a bullet on that too. The coconut was white and creamy. The scent smelled good just like shea butter. It has been two weeks and my skin is so soft and moist. I will be buying this product again in the near future."

26,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a high-quality coconut oil. No cheap additives, no unhealthy stuff mixed in with it.I have been using coconut oil on my hair for years. It works better than anything else I have tried.  It can quickly turn ""bad hair"" into beautiful hair.I also  use coconut oil for baking.I think for most people, this product is fine for their hair. There's a catch with using coconut oil on my hair. Because my hair is so thick, using coconut oil that is solid at room temperature doesn't work well for me. I can't work it down to the roots and I get little bits sticking to my hair. So I use a premium liquid version; I keep the bottle in the bathroom for that purpose. Cooking is always with the solid at room temperature version.And rather than use toxic shaving cream (most shaving creams contain toxins that you absorb through your skin), I use coconut oil. You don't get the big lather, which to me is a plus because I can then see what I am doing. You do get great lubrication while moisturizing your skin and any oil that stays on the blade helps it last longer by protecting it from corrosion.Since this product is 100% extra virgin coconut oil, you can eat it. That means it's perfectly safe for your hair and scalp and if your hair isn't conducive to using this form of the oil you can use it in the kitchen for many different kinds of cooking needs. Coconut oil has a smoke point of 350 degrees F, so it's not quite appropriate for popcorn (use peanut oil, which has a smoke point of 450 degrees F).In addition to being non-toxic, coconut oil has many health benefits. Some people believe they should avoid it, under the theory a low-fat diet is good for your health. In fact, a low-fat diet is harmful to your brain. Men on low-fat diets have low testosterone, and anyone on a low-fat diet runs a much higher risk of neurological disease. Yes, too much fat is bad but don't fear using coconut oil. I use it regularly, and also consume organic butter, whole eggs, avocados, and nuts regularly; yet my body fat is below the 5% threshold required for a body fat scale to read it and I have not been sick since 1971."
27,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Far more expensive because it's ""beauty"" instead of kitchen coconut oil","This is literally the same stuff as 100% extra virgin coconut oil that you get for about 1/4  the price. Heck, you can get organic 100% extra virgin oil for slightly over half the price. There is nothing in this except for coconut oil, but the only difference is that there's no mention of culinary uses on the label.  Pro tip: You can use any coconut oil for either beauty or culinary use.  100% extra virgin is the second-nicest kind; the best is 100% organic extra virgin.So it's hard to know how to rate this. As coconut oil, it's fine. Works well on skin, hair (in small quantities), chapped lips, rough feet, and in stir fries, baking, and sauteing.  The product is the same as every other extra-virgin coconut oil I've seen.  But unless you want to spend at least $15 for nothing except for the beauty-specific label on the bottle, I'd buy a different brand."
28,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The one ingredient in this product is coconut oil. It contains no phthalates, parabens, mineral oils, or sulfates. This makes it ideal for those trying to avoid unnecessary chemicals in skincare products. It’s also cruelty-free. The label states it is extra virgin coconut oil, but there is no extra virgin grade for coconut oil in the US. Virgin grade coconut oil means the oil is unrefined.I have used this oil on my face and especially my heels which tend to become rough and cracked in cold weather. After a few days of use at night, my skin is more smooth and supple. I have also found it very effective as a makeup remover, particularly for the delicate eye area. When applying the oil at night I put a small amount (less than ½ teaspoon) and rub it in my hands to soften it. (In the jar, it has the consistency of butter.) Then I gently smooth it over my face and neck. My heels get some too before I put on socks.At first, the formula leaves a greasy finish on the skin. This gradually goes away. This is the only negative I have found with the product. In the morning, my skin is smooth without any oily residue. I like that coconut oil is naturally antibacterial and antifungal. Best of all, I don’t need a separate makeup remover and night cream, since it does the job of both without adding a buildup of harmful chemicals. The product scores a (1) on the EWG skin deep website. Because it is so greasy, it probably wouldn’t be advisable to use it on oily skin.There are conflicting opinions on its effects as a treatment before shampooing. especially on coarse or dry hair. Some people warn it can increase brittleness. Others say it can be used to increase softness and shine and prevent fly-aways. I have not tried the product on my hair."
29,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have fairly chronic dry skin.  I was previously using various other oils and moisturizer creams which work for a while but not throughout the day.  I've never tried a coconut oil based product before, and was curious to see how it would work.It is pure coconut oil.  Solid at room temperature, liquid at body temperature.  The texture is a bit grainy at first but once it melts it goes on smoothy.  It has a pleasing coconut scent.  Once applied the skin feels a bit oily but not excessively so.Because it's solid at room temperature it can be hard to get out of the container.  I've found that the trick is to apply enough pressure with the fingertips to scrape some off the surface which helps get enough onto my fingers to apply with relative ease.  A little goes a long way!When the product arrived it had settled into one side of the jar like it had melted in transit.  I re-melted it with warm water to resettle it after which it seemed perfectly fine.All in all I'm relatively pleased with this product.  Seems to be very high quality, and as a moisturizer it works well enough and is inexpensive enough compared to what I've been using that I will likely continue purchasing it in the future."
30,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This has a strong coconut scent to it and if that bothers you then keep looking. This is solid most of the time in the jar and will melt in your hand due to your body temperature. If it is above 75 in your house this will start to soften up in the jar but still remain in a solid form, any hotter and this will melt to a liquid form.I use this daily after my shower/bath and have found that it does leave my skin soft and moisturized - if you use too much it will look oily on your skin.  A little truly goes a long ways!There are no toxic additives or scents or colors added - this makes it perfect for those with allergies.This is produced by a well known company who help empower women!"
31,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,TOP 500 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit confused that this was just Coconut Oil because from the product brand ""SheaMoisture"" I thought it was a mix with Shea butter. I was wrong - so clearing that up in case anyone else thinks the same. That said, the product looks and feels high quality. I use coconut oil for both cooking and beauty, so have tried tons of brands. This smells nice when you open it, which does not happen with some of the coconut oils I've used. It feels nice, melting quickly in my hands and spreading easily on my skin. The company promotes helping women and overall it has a good vibe, so if that's important to you, you get that extra sense of helping the world with this product. It is more expensive than some coconut oils, but I'm not sure if that's due to quality (which is high) or the company using funds to lift women. Overall, I'm happy with it and will use it as a gift to my skin and hair and to remove my eye makeup. Love it."
32,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I use coconut oil for almost everything. I use it for cooking, haircare, skincare, dental care and keeping hair dye off my skin during treatments. This coconut oil works great for all of my skin/hair care needs and the jar looks great. The size of the container is perfect for my bathroom sink. It is paraben, phthalate, mineral oil, and sulfate-free. It also wasn't tested on animals. I love this brand and how much care they take to put out a quality product with minimal effects on our world. This is a company I can feel good giving my money to and I'd highly recommend it!"
33,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I use this for everything! I solely use this brand for beauty purposes. Body lotion, massage oil, lip balm, make-up removal, hair oil.  I've been using coconut oil before showering as an all-over moisturizer and deep conditioning for my hair. As for my hair? It's shiny, it doesn't feel oily at all, and frizz-free.  I've gotten my whole family hooked, too. I've purchased several different qualities of coconut oil in the past (in fact, one of the best is at dollar tree), and I can tell that this stuff is of higher quality. The texture is nice and smooth, it remains homogenous."
34,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm in love. Not only do I use this for my hair, skin, and pregnant belly, I have also been using it to mix with my essential oils. Its amazing. This is amazing to use for almost everything. Totally worth the money. Especially with winter here my hair and skin need extra moisture. And to top it off I can use it on my sick boyfriend with peppermint essential oil to help him breathe."

The coconut oil is solid at room temperature but quickly melts in your warm hands.Great for extra dry skin on legs and feet.

36,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this stuff as much for what’s not in it as much as for what is! The only ingredient is coconut oil! How refreshing! Sustainable, cruelty free, none of the junk that we’ve learned can be so bad for us. Also, it is true that a little goes a very long way.I really like the company as well. (If you read what’s on the center photograph I’ve added “Our Story” you’ll find more of what I like about the company.)"
37,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good!,"This coconut oil smells so good. I use this after I shower to smooth all over my body. I need some added moisturizer on my skin, as I tend to get Eczema flare-ups during winter time. This has helped with some scaly parts on my hands. I like using this on my face as well, because there is nothing in this but coconut oil. I find that I don't to use too much of this, as a little bit goes a long way."
38,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like Rafaello candy,"This pure coconut oil is quite expensive - all it is is just a pure coconut oil. It works great all over body - great for hair, skin and nails. It does smell delicious like rafaello candy. You could use any coconut oil on your skin but the ones that I got from a grocery store do not smell as delicious.I am giving 5 stars regardless expensive price just because this oil smells so great."
39,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,While in the container it's kinda in a butter like form. It melts rather quickly though when rubbed in your hands and just a little bit goes a long way. I'm able to moisturize my upper body with just a quarter sized amount. It's scent free and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. I even used it in my hair and it definitely softens it up after a shower and leaves a nice shine.
40,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Quality 100% Coconut Oil,"A little bit goes a long way with this product.  I put a small dab in my palm, rub my hands together & then massage in to my skin.  It is wonderful & very moisturizing.  If you have very dry, curly hair, a little dab will smooth out the cuticle & protect it from more damage.This is 100% Coconut Oil – nothing added."

I typically would eat a tablespoon of coconut oil every day for glowing skin and a speedy metabolism. I use this one immediately after stepping out of the shower and on my hair, for glowing skin and strong tresses. I feel this product is a good quality for the money."
42,SheaMoisture 100 percent Extra Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizer and Leave-In Conditioner for Head-to-Toe Pampering Nourishing Hydration Skin and Hair Care with No Sulfates 2 Count,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Moisturizer,"As one grows older, our skin dries out and wrinkles increase.

With daily use, the skin on my face, arms, and hands has become much softer, and the wrinkles have diminished. Recommended."

2,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It is suppose to be alcohol free. And it has a isopropal in it  so it does have alcohol,I ordered this product and it was suppose to be alcohol free. It has a isopropal in it.. That is alcohol. I'm very allergic to it and it drives me crazy at all the itching.. And I don't have dandruff.. But its embarrassing how bad it makes me itch. Liz Brewton
3,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,My favorite gel to use for my curly haired toddler
4,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only product that keeps my curls in tack,When I use this product it really works with my texture of hair.
5,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for sensory sensitivity scent wise,I didnt break the seal and i can smell this. It can be smelled with the cap on. Way way to heavy smelling and i could never have this on my hair. Its a shame so many products are so heavy with scents. It makes it hard to find things.
6,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Inexpensive Holy Grail,"I absolutely love this gel. I'm really upset that I can't find it in CVS or Ulta anymore. I hope Sheamoisture doesn't stop making this because it's the only hair gel that defines my curls so nicely. I first cowash my hair, squeeze out the extra water, then apply the gel. It's amazing! I sometimes like to use it with Sheamoisture Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Leave-In Milk.Info about me: 4a, fine strands, low density, high porosity."
7,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,No alcohol,I like that it contains no alcohol which other products have and they make my hair “ hard and crunchy “

Can't find it in stores anymore so I got it on Amazon. I could smell this stuff before I even open to the Box. Ended up just giving it away to someone.
9,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,DON’T BUY,"I literally never write reviews, but I have to warn you guys! This is NOT the same product that is sold in stores. I’ve been using this for years. I love it. I bought this off Amazon because I could no longer find it in stores. The texture is different. It’s a little more runny. The smell is also different. This product breaks out my scalp and dries out my hair!!THIS IS A FAKE!!"

15,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair can't live without this,"I've spent my whole life trying to find the perfect product for my fine curly (frizzy) hair that doesn't make it stiff or look greasy. This is it!I use the gel/cream on my damp hair after washing, and set it in curlers to air dry. My hair comes out soft an wavy. I use some on the dry hair to cut down on frizz and to keep the curls in place. My hair can still move, but doesn't get crazy. I can walk around outside with my hair down without it turning into a rat's nest."
16,"Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Styling Gel 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Hydrating, Alcohol-Free Hair Gel 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dissatisfied,Made my hair feel weighed down and hard to brush
0,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well on fine straight hair.,"Im a fine, straight haired girl who much like my CG sisters has stepped away from products with silicone in it due to how greasy and flat it makes my hair.The answer to that was Shea Moisture 100% Coconut Oil leave in.  No silicones, full of great ingredients that condition and feed the hair without weighing it down.I spray a couple pumps on my palms then work thru from mid shaft to ends. Leaves a lasting beautiful scent (that hummingbirds seem to like as one would not leave me alone while sitting outside reading a book), lightly softens and releases some tangles for easy combing.Thank you Shea Moisture for making such wonderful products!"
1,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great leave in conditioner! I’m happy I got it!,"I used this product for the first time after my shower this afternoon and wow! I’m impressed, it left my hair smelling wonderful(light coconut/clean smell) and it made my hair super soft and manageable. I am very happy with my purchase & recommend!"
2,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft.,"Hair type: high porosity, 2C/3APros: smells good, controlled frizz, made hair super soft, very defined, smooth, manageable.Cons: to thick for a spray, Fragrance is way to high in the list making it a very concentrated smell and taking up majority of the percentages for being on top. Other ingredients Should be."
3,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING and affordable,I normally have frizzy hair but this product left my hair feeling so soft and smooth.... I have never found an affordable product that could do that. I will definitely be stocking up on this.
4,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent High Porosity Product,Excellent product. My hair looks healthy and shiny.  This item controls my high porosity hair very well. I look like a different person with tamed hair.
5,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to like this product,I've used other products from the same brand and loved them.  I was really hopeful this product would be able to replace my other detangler/leave-in-conditioner.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to provide much extra moisture and my hair is not very soft after air drying.  The smell is great though.
6,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I want to thank TJMaxx for having this product but then I couldn't find it there. I have found it at the pharmacy but it is better priced here. It detangles hair almost immediately! I have think wavy hair so it can get a crazy knot over a couple of days! It also smells great! Highly recommend.
7,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely a fan!,This works really well. I use it on my sons’ hair. One has a skin fade and the other has 2 inches of hair with a skin fade. They both had flakiness before we started using this. This moisturizes really well.
8,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells soooo good! (detangles long, thin hair)","The media could not be loaded.
                




   The scent of this is incredible!  My boyfriend commented on it right away.  It is a light fresh coconut smell.  (Don’t worry, it does NOT smell like sun tan lotion.)  I have long, thin hair, and I bought this to hopefully strengthen my hair and prevent more breakage.  I was surprised how well this detangled my hair.  It was so much easier to comb after washing.  I’ve also been using this to finish my hair after blow-drying...I just spray some in my hands and run a small amount over my dry hair.  It makes my hair super soft!  See video for how it sprays out of the bottle.  It comes out a bit inconsistently, and it’s not a super fine mist.  I recommend only spraying it directly on wet hair.  For dry hair, spray it in your hands to apply.  I’m loving this product so far and will buy it again."
9,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading product information .....,"First the ingredients of package and this listing for the product do not match up.  The listing shows on Amazon shows ""FRAGRANCE"" toward the bottom of the ingredient list.  Look on the bottle and it is actually at the top of the ingredient list, meaning there is more of that ingredient. Not to mention, the product came in a shipping box, no lid, cap or shrink wrap.  The pic shows exactly how it came.  Plus the plump was already primed, spaying with one pump, proving to me that it was a return.  Anything you buy with a sprayer or pump usually you have to try pressing the pump a few times before product will spray, coming like they from factory.I was going update once I use it on my daughter's hair but now I am very reluctant to use on my daughter's hair.  I have noticed sofar that the product is thick but thin enough to spray without an issue. Also the smell is phenomenal although strong.IDK what to think.  Seems like a legit brand, Just difficult supplier(?)"
10,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Knock off,Do not buy this product it is a knock off. I’ve gone to Ulta many times and never has it had the consistency of lotion. And it smells of chemicals. Whoever is the selling this needs to get banned.  Who knows what I was putting in my hair
11,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Completely saved my hair,"Absolutely amazing product. Liked it so much I purchased again when I ran out. I have colored and lightened my hair sooo many times and the last time I went blonde I really needed to find a good leave in that would help restore my hair. I’ve used several leave in products before and most will weigh down my hair or leave it looking too shiny. Amazing scent, and a little goes a long way. I also have hair that tangles very easily and this + a wet brush and my hair is smooth and tangle free in less than a minute. I am also a cosmetologist so you can take my review seriously. Good for the price and I’ve seen my hair go from looking terrible at the ends to smooth and beautiful. My new favorite product and I would highly recommend if you have damaged hair."
12,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,No matter what it's for your hair type.,If your a foster parent and you never know what life is gonna give you next this is a just have!!!!!This has become everyone in our house go to hair product. From baby fine hair to more thick and course AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.❤💛💙💜💚LOVE THIS PRODUCT
13,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Packaging needs work,"The product itself is great; however, the packing of the product deserves zero stars. Some of the product was wasted outside of the bottle."
14,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thin 2b-ish hair, and I needed a lightweight leave in. This was well recommended, so I gave it a go. It seems like the formula is nice and helped keep my hair moisturized between washes, but the smell set off my allergies and migraines so badly. I have other products in this exact same coconut line from shea moisture- the shampoo and conditioners are my default products, and they don't bother my nose at all. I suspect this has either a lot more of the same fragrance, or something else in the formula adds to it. It is super, super strong, and it lasts forever on my hair, I had to get rid of it."
15,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good leave in treatment,"I spray in my hands and put through my hair otherwise I feel it makes my hair to oily in places. I don't know might just be my hair. I have super fine, dry and thin hair. With my health issues my hair struggles to be healthy. I feel using this the last couple months has helped my hair. I may look it more products by this brand."
16,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved my bleached hair!!!,"I love this product!!! This has made my highlighted bleached hair feel and look so soft. My hair is very dry due to bleaching but after using this leave in treatment my hair is back to normal! I cant reccomend this enough!!!! This is perfect for dry damaged hair!!! I'm so happy I found this, it has made a huge difference in my hair..it also smells very nice! Please never discontinue this product it's the best!!!!"
17,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty sure this is a knock off,The bottle to the left is store bought and the bottle on the right is the one I purchased here. As soon as I grabbed it I noticed the difference in the color of the liquid and even size of the bottle. As you can see in the picture even the font and design is different. When I opened the bottle even the texture was wayyyyy too water and it didn’t have a scent at all. Very disappointed.
18,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not for all hair types,"It says it’s for all hair types, I have 4c hair that has high porosity, so my hair soaked this stuff up quickly and still felt dry. I applied multiple times and it’s decent. It has the consistency of watery lotion, so if you have naturally curly hair, this stuff will make your hair revert back to its natural state as if you put water in your hair. It smells good at least and is lightweight but if you have type 4 hair, I’d say this stuff is pretty weak."
19,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally found what I was looking for!,"After over 20 years of trial and error: air dry, hot/warm/cool blow dry, coconut oil, olive oil, dozens of conditioners, serums -- this is by far the best product for my hair.I shampoo as normal, put in few squirts to hair.  Blow dry on cool.  Then a bit more conditioner and pomade and my hair is silky smooth all day with nice shine.  Glad I finally found this.  Will only ever order this into the future."
20,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,goeey and gluey residue left on ur hair,"OMG...this product is nothing like its shampoo. i love the shampoo but this leave in conditioner makes your hair become like glue. After a normal wash, I sprayed on this leave in conditioner and my hair felt like it was all gelled together. It was like putting a whole bottle of coconut oil on your hair. If you want super moisturization then this product is for you. I do not feel like i can wear this product after a wash to go out or go to work. It looks like you havent washed your hair in days. After this really bad feeling, I tried to wash my hair several times and this gooey residue remains. I am hoping this will come off very soon. I am thinking it will take a few more washes."
21,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,"I like to use this to cool my scalp on hot days, it smells nice and moisturizes your hair too. I also use it along with my regular Haircare routine regarding the L.O.C method for 4C hair"
22,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,I love this!! This is a must have for curly hair that tends to get tangled easily! Especially with highlights the hair gets dry. This leaves my hair soft and easy to detangle.
23,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nauseating fragrance,"I bought this for the first time on Amazon and after receiving it, I’m so surprised at all the positive reviews mentioning the nice smell. The fragrance is SO overpowering, I can’t even use it. It gave me a headache and I had to take a shower after to get the smell off of me. I included a photo of the bottle I got - I noticed a few people said the label was slightly different than the one you buy in stores so maybe the formula is slightly different? The ingredients do look the same from what I can tell though. Disappointed because the ingredients look good otherwise."
24,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy Safe Ingredients. Leave Hair Feeling Fresh,"LOVE this product. I bought primary cause I am a fan of the brand. If you’re not familiar with Shea Moisture they are an amazing brand that consistently delivers high quality products. What really sets them apart is their use of natural and safe ingrediates and that they are chemical free. In the past I’ve struggled to find natural products that still work effectively. Shea Moisture is that brand. With this product specifically I love it cause I can spray on my hair at any time - damp or dry. It has a great smell, goes on very lightly, and doesn’t leave my hair feeling greasy. It’s the perfect quick spray to make my hair a bit healthier. Highly recommend!!"
25,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Chemical burn!!,I really never leave reviews. But this one I had to. DO NOT USE THIS BRAND. I’ve now tried their conditioner and this spray leave in conditioner. This is what it did to me. Skin was on fire for two days straight. Feels like a chemical burn. Also made my hair incredibly greasy and impossible to brush through. Would never recommend.
26,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will def order more,"Love this! Just Received today. And put on my natural hair single braids sprayed it on. The scent is so delightful, makes my hair moist and soft and love the spray detangler so far. Hair has a condition feel.  Will try once I take down my single braids my hair is 4C So we’ll see how well it detangles later. Love it so far though"
27,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold and controls frizzies!,"I was using regular coconut oil in my hair bc I didn’t want a ton of chemicals, but this is a great replacement. How it sprays is a little off...it doesn’t spray smooth like hair spray does. That doesn’t affect it though. Just use your fingers to mix it in your hair, smells great, keeps my frizzies in control and has good hold. My hair isn’t hard but isn’t soft. If I use my fingers it’ll soften and still hold."
28,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I imagined,"Normally this brand is amazing so I didn't think twice about getting a leave-in conditioner from SheaMoisture. I was desperate, my hair tangles and I'm stuck with knots and matting at the nape of my neck because my hair is so long and thick. I don't shampoo every day, I only condition and rinse, but my hair has its own agenda. I was hopeful with this product but after two days, it honestly sucks. My hair is not soft. It still tangles. And worst of all, my hair feels gross. When I run my fingers through it, my hands are covered in product. If you're looking for a product to add texture to your hair, this would be great. But I'm still on the struggle bus with knotting so I have to look somewhere else."
29,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Too fragrant, holds hair like a gel","I thought this would be more like an oil, given the ingredient list. But this holds hair more like a low hold gel. You can feel that stiffness in the hair. It doesn't spread well either.A couple of reviews pointed this out and I felt the same that the fragrance is waaaay to high- even the neighbors could smell it. Literally! I went out for a run in the evening, maintaining quite a distance from others in this pandemic, and there were heads turning to know where that smell was coming from. I was a running cloud of cheap perfume. Doesn't wash off in a couple of washes. I'd rather sport the smell of coconut oil than this cheap blend of chemicals."
30,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE!!!!,"I love this product, it makes my wavy hair more defined and a little curly. My son is biracial and has thick hair, he ended up using at least half of it. It has a great smell too! Found the only product I need to wear my dye damaged hair down! Better than any leave in I've ever purchased!"
31,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,helps maintain hair healthy,"Used this product on and off, but now I have been using it more and am pleased with the results. It smells like coconut and its pretty calming after showers if you like that scent. Definitely helps with frizz and makes my hair smooth. Would recommend, especially because a little goes a long way and it's been lasting me."
32,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most awesome hair product ever!,"Winter dryness was causing my hair to look like I stuck my finger in a socket!  When I brushed my hair there was so much static I could hear a crackeling sound.  One application on my dry hair got rid of all that and made my hair soft and smooth without weighing it down (I have long gray hair).  The coconut scent is very subtle. I gave 4 stars on scent only because I prefer unscented products, which are difficult to find and can be expensive..  LOVE LOVE LOVE!"
33,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great. But I had to put in about 20 sprays.,"The first day that I used this, I only put in about seven or eight sprays directly into my hair, and didn't see much of a difference. So the second day I did about 12 sprays into my hair and then another Ten sprays into my hand and then ran it through my hair. That made a huge difference. It left my hair much less frizzy. The curls were much more defined. I usually use WEN, which is great but leaves my hair feeling more creamy, as if I have something in it. This product made my hair feel as if I had nothing at all in it. And it is also so much cheaper. So I ordered another bottle, and we'll keep using it!"
34,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for curly hair,"I am getting into the shea moisture hair product collection . So I decided to give this a try because after salons closed for so long in the spring, I was caring for my own curly hair . Once it became more hotter in NY my hair needed some more moisture since I kept it curly for a while , I wanted something that helps keep it moisture, detangled and silky and this leave in has done just that.  Now the salons are open but I still love  by my leave In. I love it."
35,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,You should buy it!,"I live how soft and moisturizer my hair is after using it. Also, it keeps a lot with the tangles and I don't need to pull my hair anymore. The scent is delicious! I really liked it! I've been using this since almost one month."
36,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for biracial hair,My son is biracial and I was struggling with finding a product that kept the moisture in and did not dry his hair and scalp out. This has been a game changer. I absolutely love this stuff! The dry patch of skin on top of his head has been completely gone since I started using this several months ago. His hair is much softer now as well. I highly recommend it!
37,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful smell,threw it out!!!",Won't be buying again! Terrible smell!
38,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Conditioning > detangling,"I heard lovely things about this product, and it does leave hair very soft and happy.Unfortunately it's more nourishing than detangling, and my bleached wavy hair needs really a lot of slip to work through tangles.I still use it, I just take more product and work slowly around the knots. If you need moisture over detangling it's probably going to be perfect for you.Smell is really heavenly."
39,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t moisturize my hair,"Bought this because of the good reviews but am disappointed I don’t see any real moisturizing benefit to my hair. It could just be my hair type… I have fine hair, lightly colored and a lot of it. Going to stick with Moroccan oil for the ends of my hair as it moisturizes much better. I recognize everyone’s hair type is different so this may work better for others."
40,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not ideal for fine hair,"I live in the desert so the dryness creates static and static creates hairs knots every day.  I have long fine hair and was hoping this product could help hydrate as well as detangle my hair.After using it several times I discovered that while it smells great and does a wonderful job with helping detangle hair, it leaves my hair dull , stiff and flat. I have now started to simply detangle my hair with conditioner in the shower and that has been working from me much better. I will not be purchasing this product again unfortunately."
41,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Did What It Claimed, But Left Hair VERY Oily","At first the product worked okay. On the second use when I put it in my damp hair, my hair become oily. I have slightly oily scalp but when I started using this spray it only got worse. It had a nice smell but after some time my sister began to tell me that my hair smelled like olive oil. It did do as it claimed, which is defrizz, soften and detangle the hair. But at the cost of leaving it very oily. I feel like it would work better for dry scalp due to how oily it is, but it is all down to weighing the pros and cons. The refund service was excellent so don’t be afraid to try it out."
42,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love It!,"Got this product recently for my wavy hair(2b/3c) and I love it! The spray mist is finer than other products in case you want to spray directly on to your hair, I still just spray in to my hands then on to my hair. It’s really hydrating without weighing down my waves or causing them to stretch out. That was really important to me as my hair is easily weighed down with products. Truly recommend and enjoy using both the product and this brand!"
43,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get this product!,"I have wild curly/ wavy hair and for months now I’ve been trying to find a product that can control my frizz and this is it! I’ve literally tried at least a dozen different products and this one is so great for everyday use, as I’m trying to bring back my natural curls and straighten my hair less. It’s sooo ridiculously soft on my hair and defines the curls well. The scent is amazing too. You will not be dissapointed"
44,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too much artificial fragrance.,"I made the mistake of reading the ingredient list included in the product description. That is a rather nice list. HOWEVER, the ingredient list in the picture of the BOTTLE is very different. Artificial fragrance is very high on the list and very strong. They must have been bought out. Too bad. Must return."
45,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quality Control Sucks,Product it self is good the but this is the second time ordering this both times the cap was missing. This time cap missing and leaked product and the spray part of bottle is damaged so won't spray and will leak if not upright. I had to transfer product into an old bottle to use. It would have made even a bigger mess trying to ship back to return. I wont be ordering this here again.
46,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Product is nice, sprayer never worked","In Amazon’s defense, they gave me a refund on this product without having to return it; however, I never really got to experience what it’s really like. It seems to be so thick that it clogged up the sprayer, but it does smell nice, is natural, and works to detangle my granddaughter’s knotted long strawberry blonde hair (she screams, it hurts so bad to brush it). Just can’t spray it, have to glob it into my hand."
47,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Spray bottle arrived broken,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I’ll start with the good:Smells niceDoesn’t feel heavyMy wet hair felt smooth and detangled when I put this inNow for the bad (see video):The bottle did not come with a cap.The pump sprayer arrived completely broken and nonfunctionalI’m currently just dumping a small amount in my palm to apply it to my hair since the sprayer is no functioningI guess I have to find an old spray bottle to pour this into so I can use it properly!?!?!"
48,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Serves its purpose but....,"My daughter gets major hair knots and this helped smooth it out....BUT it eventually started making her hair oily and developed dandruff...bizarre so maybe I was over doing it and spraying too much after her shower or I used it too often...I would suggest using a little big and on the ends of the hair, not close to scalp to avoid issues like the ones I described."
49,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Immediate Effect, Love it!","On our first use of the product we saw it improve the manageability of my daughter's hair. I also put it in my hair (which was flat ironed a few days earlier) and it did not lose its flatness. So it is not water based. Very nice. Can be used on flat ironed hair, curly hair, dry hair and damp hair. I love the smell too. Very nice."
50,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Gummy Hair,"Although this product smelled heavenly, it left yy hair feeling sticky & gummy. At first, I thought I had used to much product so the next time I used less and it still felt gummy and dirty after putting it in my clean hair. I can't say it did much for moisturizing because I couldn't get past the gummy, sticky feeling it left on my hair and ended up rinsing it out both times."
51,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'll be buying this forever now...,"It's perfect - does not weight my hair down, won't make it greasy, helps detangle and smells so good.  The spray thingy does not clog as well - nice!  I like it so much better than wash-out conditioner.  A little goes a long way."
52,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best for little girl curls,The spritzer part almost never works. 5 of 6 I think haven’t worked. I using pour into a different spritz bottle with some water to use as a detangler daily. For extra curly curly I use the product straight up. Nice lite scent ( I like this scent more than the kids option).
53,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,"Cap was missing, but the bottle seemed otherwise undamaged. No leaks. The ends of my long hair get dry and I wanted something to condition my hair between shampoos. Was hopeful about this product. Followed the directions and sprayed some on damp hair. Made my hair feel stiff and wooden, not soft and pliable. The product is disappointing but too much trouble to return."
54,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow this really works ! No tangle anymore,My 5 year old has thin hair and always have tangled hair at the end of a day. I never expect this product can totally solve the problem of it. She loves the scent as well. Her hair looks so smooth and shiny now all the time. I even use for my self after shampooing my hair since i dont use conditioner separately.Thanks to the company and Amazon!
55,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it but too thick for the sprayer,I love SheaMoisture products and this one is no exception. I bought this to help untangle my hair after shower and it helps a lot. It also has a nice coconut scent that I love and control my hair frizz. The only thing I don't like is the formula is too thick for the sprayer that it's really hard to spray it out. I eventually ditch the sprayer and just pour it in my hand to apply.
56,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works for me,"I have very very thick, dry, frizzy hair. I’ve tried a lot of different products and never really found ‘magic’. This product works better than many I’ve tried and I will buy it again. I spray this on my brush and brush sections of my hair because it’s so thick. It does add a little moisture and has a soft pleasant smell."
57,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for old white dude hair!,Old white dude with shoulder length long hair. Just got this a couple of weeks ago and I love the way it makes my hair feel. Smell is good but not overpowering. I spray it in after towel dry and comb my hair. I will look into their other hair products when I use my expensive shampoo up.
58,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy!,This did absolutely nothing to help with the dryness of mine or my daughter's hair and left a greasy coating over our strands. Not impressed.
59,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but appears used.","My bottle arrived without a cap and had clearly been used. I was very disappointed since I actually love this product and often find it difficult to purchase in stores in my area. I don’t feel comfortable using it given the condition it arrived in and plan to throw it away. I’d rather lose $10 than lose my hair.  Unfortunately I did not read the reviews from this seller before purchasing, or I would have realized that other customers had the same experience."
60,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Thrown in the bag!,This item arrived without a safety seal or cap on the bottle like it was just thrown in the bag and mailed off from sitting on someone's dresser or something!
61,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my hair,"My hair is medium-fine and didn't absorb any moisture from this product. It sat on my hair and made it oily. However, when I rinsed my hair the next day because I couldn't take the oiliness any longer, my hair felt pretty good. So I could probabaly use this as a deep conditioner."
62,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love!,"Love this so much! Leaves my hair so soft & not crunchy feeling, plus it smells sooo good! Normally I have to get my dead ends trimmed every 8 weeks & the last time I went my hair dresser said my ends looked great & I didn't need a trim! That is a really big deal for me as I have been trying to grow my hair out for what seems like eternity!"
63,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves hair greasy,"It leaves my hair moisturized, just a little too much. I have very fine, frizzy hair, so I needed something light to tame it. I use this occasionally, but I would recommend other products over this one"
64,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,doesn’t leave hair greasy,doesn’t leave hair greasy
65,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!!!,I have tried all the expensive hair products and I couldn’t believe the results I got for the price. I also use the shampoo and conditioner and my hair has changed dramatically. It’s so soft and I even got compliments on how healthy it is.The only problem was that it arrived with no lid and was damaged.
66,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great,"I have very thick soft hair and it's frizzy. This product smells amazing and works wonders on my hair! My hair is smooth and shiny, I have gotten a few compliments. You don't need a lot, just spray in the middle (not roots) and brush your hair then blow dry. I usually towel dry, then spray and wrap with towel for an hour before blow dry."
67,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST de tangler and BEST smell,"You GUYS. This stuff is amazing. I was on edge because it was so cheap and I was thinking it couldn’t be that great. I have very thick curly crazy hair and this stuff is the only thing that works for me. The coconut smell literally leaves your hair smelling so clean! And yes, it really does smell like coconut. It’s a good size, I have a ton of hair and only use about three sprays after I shower and my tangles come right out. Love it. Would definitely recommend."
68,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it but wasn't wrapped and no cap!,Love my leave in! The only thing that was missing from the bottle was the plastic wrapping and the cap though all the others in the order were wrapped individually in plastic and had their caps!
69,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sad waste of money for quality and fragrance. However, our dog, Atticus, gets both wash & RINSE!","I really wanted to like this conditioner but the smell, to me, is terrible and the ability to work as a softener is simply not there. I’m sincerely disappointed because I keep trying it to use it up. It isn’t worth it and I’ve decided to take the loss. Check it out if you like but if you want a nice coconut fragrance, my opinion is that it was a waste of money. There is just too many great products to choose from much better than this one. We are using on the dog after a bath. He doesn’t seem to mind the smell! Ha:-)"
70,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t work,"Does not detangle at all. I have fine hair and it does nothing to help with tangles. It does leave it a little softer, and if you use to much it makes your hair greasy and wet looking, but that’s about it."
71,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my favorite products.,"I love this sheamoisture leave in.I have been using this for several years now.It does what it needs to do.I wake up and unwrap my hair, its usually dry. I spray this conditioner in my hair, and it soften it right up.Making it more manageable to style and go."
72,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,"Does wonders for my curly hair. Love this, makes my hair soft and smells very good. Will buy again."
73,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unsealed product.,"I had to replace this bottle.  The replacement is a little better.  Still not sure if I want to use it.  If Sellers would focus on their packaging as much as they do on their product, it would not create such an inconvenience on all parties involved.  We live in turbulent times.  I would no longer want to put anything on my head, face, or body that looks tampered with than I would in my mouth."
74,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells awful,"This doesn’t make my hair feel any softer at all. In fact, it doesn’t smell anything like coconut at ALL. It smells like pickles or vinegar! Will not be using."
75,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Product is mid okey, but shipping is less than 1 star","I ordered this on dec 23, it was supposed to arrive on 28th. Which is a long time for Prime, but ok, I took the deal. However, they didn’t even ship out this product until the 28th!!! I waited until 30th to receive this product and it came like the picture. One bottle okey, but the other one covered, COVERED with leaking product. The nozzle doesn’t work too. The product is fine at most, but the broken parts, the shipping and the leaking, it’s not worth the money."
76,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works fine. Arrived with no cap,Smell is nice. I use it on myself and my 2yo daughter who has curly hair. It works great for detangling. Not a big issue but it arrived without a CAP on it.
77,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,SHOCKING RESULTS!,"I love this. I have never used something like this before and I will now continue to use it. After applying this product out of the shower, my comb ran thru my hair so easily. The smell is good, but not too strong. My hair feels so much better. You all need to try this seriously!!"
78,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great product!!!,"I love ALL the Shea Moisture products.  I've used them on my son since birth and he will be six end of June.  He has longer, fine, blonde hair and the leave in condioner keeps it soft making it easy for him to brush and maintain."
79,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was not expecting this.....,"Just received this product, and I was disappointed with it.  I wanted to like it..but it actually left my hair feeling a little dry (moisturizing product?) and did not have a clean feeling, considering my hair had been shampooed"
80,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,its perfect,"this treats my curly hair so well, it smells amazing, makes my hair soft, less frizzy, gives it the right amount of volume, and feels refreshing, I can use it while my hair is wet and brush it through, or I can pad it on while dry to moisturize and make my hair look freshly washed. I have 2b-2c hair and I have a friend with 3c hair who also uses this every day. I would definitely buy this again."
81,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The BEST Leave-in Ever!,"I only purchased this conditioner because my usual go-to leave-in conditioner (Creme of Nature Argan Oil) was out-of-stock everywhere; however, I was pleasantly surprised! This has to be the BEST leave-in I've ever used. The consistency is thick & rich, & the smell is delightful! Most importantly, it thoroughly moisturizes my hair, leaving it soft, silky, & manageable. I am not mixed, however, my hair is ""mixed type"", coily. It is fairly easy to comb through, but it can become kinky if I don't keep it properly hydrated. This is now, officially, my favorite leave-in!"
82,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Defective Sprayer, will not spray!","I really want to love this product, and was excited to try it, but when I got it today and opened the package, the sprayer will not work at all! I sat pumping the nozzle for several minutes to no avail. Can't even try the product because it simply will not spray at all."
83,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thumbs up!,I really like this leave in conditioner. It’s perfect for after the pool!
84,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my hair so soft,"I use this to keep my hair from Frizzell in humidity.  While it doesn't frizz, I do wind up with big 80's hair.  I don't mind it though because it looks so thick and luxurious and its very soft to touch."
85,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves hair silky,Great! Leaves hair silky. Definitely detangles well...the hair looks good after wash. Better than many other products in this category.One negative is it contains perfume. Could have been avoided.
86,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Spray cap does not work.,I could not get the spray cap to function. It was so cheaply made that I decided the product itself may also be poorly made. I was afraid it had been tampered with. I have applied for a refund and it was issued but I did not receive the credit. I will update the review should it come through.
87,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!,"Very nice product,  it added moisture and reduced frizz while it didn't feel heavy or sticky."
88,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Detangles!,Bought this on a lightning deal and will buy again.  A great way to detangle hair after a shower!
89,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Love this product! I have long thin hair and it moisturizes and thickensMy hair. I will buy again. And knowing that there are no harsh chemicals in this makes it even better.
90,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!,I have been using this product for years! Love the coconut scent (and my friends do too) and my hair needs constant moisture and this product gives my hair curl and smells great!
91,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the scent!,"During the winter it gets so dry and my hair is everywhere. I just spray this in either right after I wash it or when it's dry and needs a little taming. Be sure to brush it through if you spray it on dry hair as it can leave little white globs in your hair if you don't. It has a great scent, too! 100% will buy this again."
92,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"Fabulous for my fine over processed hair! Left it feeling shiny! When I first put it on my wet hair I didn't feel the difference until it dried and I was so happy with results! Great leave in conditioner,  I even use a small amount on my babies messy hair."
93,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product - no tube to spray with,"This a great product, however the spray function does not work as there is no tube inside to spray with. I lost product trying to search for the tube to make the sprayer work. I have to put the product in my hands to use. That causes waste."
94,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor Bottle quality,"Smells very nice, bottle will not spray because the tubing connected to the pump was broken off and can't be placed to use the product. Had to buy another spray bottle to put the product in to use it."
95,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Hairdresser complimented my hair!,"My hairdresser asked ""What are you using on your hair as it's the healthiest I've ever seen it!"" I've noticed my hair has really started growing too since using this product. I'm very happy with it and will continue to purchase."
96,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my baby girls’ hair!,I love this for my girls’ hair!! Better than hair lotions or detangling sprays bcuz it comes ready to use in one spray bottle. I will continue to buy.
97,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,On the Fence,"I ordered this product because I love this brand and I was hoping to get a mild scent but either there was an error in packaging or the ""Coconut"" smells like a strong flower and this is not a scent I prefer.  Does not smell like expected"
98,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my hair,"Just used for the first time today after my shower.  I have wavy hair and it my hair less frizzy and curlier.  The spray bottle is not great, it squirts in 3 different directions.  Great smell, reminds me of sunbathing.  I will definitely buy again."
99,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will reorder,I am very pleased with this item and will re-order it when I run out smells great leaves my hair feeling soft. I was worried about a sticky residue however I have not encountered one as of yet. I put on my hair when it is either wet or dry.
100,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells bad, but works.","The product smells really bad. I don’t have an overly sensitive nose or anything. It’s sickly sweet. BUT, if you’re looking for something that will moisturize your hair, this will do the trick."
101,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good detangler and conditioner!,"Very light if left in after shampooing. Quickly removes tangles and moisturizes hair as well as a rinse-out conditioner without the heaviness. I even use this on my dog's dry skin/coat between washes. The smell could be a little lighter, but that's the only thing that could use work!"
102,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not soften or add moisture,"Bleh! Not happy at all with this product. It doesn’t add immediate softness like some of the other brands I’ve used in the past. I had to yank my comb through my hair, then ended up using the remaining leave in conditioner left over from my other product. Disappointing!!!"
103,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, if only it sprayed better",Love the smell.  Love the product.  The container doesn't work for me.  Hard to actually spray and doesn't cover any of my hair.  I end up having to spray it on my hands and then scrunch into my hair.  The product doesn't go far.
104,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Strong chemical smell,"The smell is very strong. The ingredients say essential oils as the fragrance, however the smell is very chemical based, not an essential oil. The smell lingers even after blow drying."
105,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing,I am now on my third bottle of this leave-in conditioner and introduced it to my mom who also loves it. It is very moisturizing without leaving your hair heavy and oily.
106,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my daughter's hair,"My 10 month old daughter is biracial, so hair care is a new adventure we are on together. This product is PERFECT to combat any dryness she had previously and help define her curls. My husband and I apply this for her after bath before bed, and in the morning. Super easy to spray on and comb through, which on a 10 month old is saying something! It has helped her hair texture/moisture so much! 10/10 would recommend."
107,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Refresh and moisturize!,"Have tried so many products, but this one is my favorite! So moisturizing bur doesn't leave my hair looking oily or crunchy....just soft and curls in place all day!"
108,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nozzel doesn’t work!,The Nozzle does not work. To pay $10 for one bottle and to receive the item in good condition-  and for it not to spray out - is very frustrating. I’ve tried to make it work on my own but it isn’t working I’m upset about that - but if the nozzle did work this product would get five stars easily.
109,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Straw is extremely short.  Won't pump.,I bought this corr my niece for Christmas.  It seems to work but the 'straw' that gets the product to the sprayer is extremely short.  is it supposed to be this way?  It no longer touches the product.  I have to hold it upside down to get anything to spray out.
110,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I hoped for,First it came in broken. There was no way I could spray this into my hair. I tried putting it into another spray bottle and it did not come out. So I just had to put it in my hands and work it into my hair. I smells really good but it did not help tame my frizz at all.
111,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,it won't spray...!,"why would one make a product that's not usable as the spray that is suggested in the directions...?  it possibly may be a decent product, but it will be difficult to test.  i have used shea moisture products in the past and i also purchased the enhancing smoothie which is thank goodness not a spray."
112,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Broken spray function,Barely used three times and pump function broke. Need to make sure don’t apply too much or hair will look greasy. Smells good. Not sure I would buy again
113,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's a must habe,I love this. It makes my natural hair so soft and smells really good.The problem is it cannot spray. I have to open it when using.
114,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"""Good hair conditioner - I have thick hair and this helps me get the knots out and leaves my hair soft"" -my wife"
115,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Spray nozzle clogged on first use,"I was really hoping a spray could cut down on my  long conditioner routine time but the spray nozzle clogged on the first use so I've been taking off the cap and pouring it out into my hands to use, which is actually talking more time than the pots of leave-in that Shea Moisture makes... Smells nice but too much of a bother to buy again."

117,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money.,So I was really hoping this would help.  Not so much. While it doesn't leave your hair really stiff..I found no softening  whatsoever...hoping to send it back.
118,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good.,Creates curl and awesome smell.
119,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works and smells good,This has helped my hair so much. It's super fine and gets weighed down easily and this works just don't put to much on. It smells good 2. My first bottle didn't pump I told Amazon and they sent a new one overnight! Awesome!
120,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best detangler,"Nice light scent. Product did leak a little during shipment. Not as detangling as I had hoped for. Will still use for now, but will try a different product next time."
121,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Long lasting!,"Works well on my curly hair as a leave in!Does not weigh it down, also great to use as a refresher! Must have for me!"
122,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it!,"Perfect for my hair. Before shea moisture my over processed wavy hair was super damaged. Had been for years. (Beyond repair in my opinion). I couldn’t even brush without washing it. And depression hair was awful. Thankfully, my hair is happy.. healthy and still vibrantly colored! I use the entire line of Shea moisture products and will never go back."
123,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not very impressed,"I got this to help create some slip when brushing my wet hair after the shower. I have fine, straight hair. The smell is lovely but I don’t notice any difference in terms of conditioning and detangling."
124,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mixture is too pure to spray, you must mix with water",Sealed and smelled great. I used this product for the first time and my curls lasted for days with no frizz. it is very pure so you need to add some water in a spray bottle to get it on your hair bc the bottle itself can't spray.
125,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,It does cause contact dermatitis to those with sensitivity!!!,"I saw that some reviews said they developed a rash, but I still purchased and hoped for the best. Found out very quickly that it caused my usual break out around the eyes. I don’t know exactly what causes this, but if you are someone like me with sensitivity to sunscreens and other over the counter products, stay away from this product! Otherwise, it really does work great and smell good, I just have to hide from the world for about a week now."
126,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"Sorry to say, I am very disappointed, with the manner this item was delivered. There, was no cover on the bottle, Even though, other reviews talk about the lovely scent, NO SCENT in this bottle, I am wondering if what is in the bottle is what should be in there."
127,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Product is been reformulated with a strong smell.,Now is no longer Sulfate free and Propylene Glycol free stronger smell is overwhelming….It’s not Color safe anymore my hair turned more yellow under tone after using this for couple days ….
128,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good!,Great leave in to detangle and moisturize hair! I probably wouldn’t suggest it for fine thin hair but any other type of hair would be good.
129,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy,"This smells ok, but really made my thin hair greasy, in addition to not detangling very well."
130,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Comes out milky and can’t use the squirt with it,Poured out milky instead of being able to spray it. Came with no cap to close spray nozzle!
131,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,This is my new holy grail for hair products. I have fine dry curly hair and I add this product when my hair feels drying and flat. It gives my curls volume without the heavy greasy feeling.

141,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great,It's a little bit hard to spray since it's so thick. Maybe a different nozzle next time. Smells great. Not heavy. I do use it daily. My hair seems to suck it up so quickly. I have 4a hair. Currently in braids.
142,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's great,"Does exactly what I wanted to my hair. Soft and no more winter frizz. The fragrance is a great, tropical scent."
143,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Nada como lo descrito,"Llegó sin tapa y con menos contenido del que se muestra en las fotos. Tiene un olor sintético (nada como el olor a coco que descrito en los review). No humecta ni hace nada, apenas humedece el cabello."
144,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Add this to your hair care routine !!,I apply this right after my shampoo & conditioner & it leaves my hair so soft.Howeverrrr I suggest spraying on your palms instead of right on your hair. Idky it sprays weird. Maybe because the product is sort of a thick consistency.
145,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just smells good dosent make a difference,I didn’t really see a difference only made myHair smell nice that’s it wouldn’t recommend tbh :(
146,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as their Manuka Honey leave-in conditioner,"I tried this product after running out of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt leave in conditioner (which I love). I find this coconut leave-in conditioner is much less effective at keeping my ends from being dry and frizzy. It’s much less effective at detangling my fine, wavy hair.In the future I will buy the Manuka Honey & Yogurt conditioner."
147,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Eh,"I bought this brand because I use and love their shampoo/conditioner. This product didn’t help to reduce my frizz which is why I bought it. It smelled nice and was light on my hair. However, it doesn’t do what I bought it to do and I know of brand which works better on my hair."
148,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy,"Mixed a small amount of cold pressed castor oil with this and with daily use, my scalp and hair feel and look amazing"
149,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle Missing It’s Cap.,"I received package within allotted time frame, however one of the bottles was missing a cap. The other bottle was in great condition but the other bottle appeared used. I will be requesting a refund or new unused product. I am giving 3 stars b/c this is a good product that I received on time, but cap was missing and this is suspicious"
150,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not new,"Second time buying product because I really like the scent and how moisturizing it is.

I usually just spray a bit on my hand and then run it through my thick curly while it's wet or just go all out. It makes my hair softer and hangs a bit more with the right amount, and just a little more manageable, but only at the right length. So I guess I got what I asked for, really. My hair can be rough like wire sometimes, this helps"

500,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this leave-in conditioner should get a 5 in stars just for the smell, It's a creamy coconut smell, you can smell the shea butter as well. I am a person that can wash my hair and the next day looks like a grease ball, so I am always worried about product making it look greasy or more oily especially with this coming out creamy. It did not make my hair greasy at all, it left it smooth, soft and had me sniffing it all day. Not only am I using it but my husband sprays it on his beard to make it soft and smell great all day long. I will say this is my new favorite leave-in conditioner."
501,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is  a great quality conditioner.  It is a tad misleading by advertising it is 100% virgin coconut oil.  What is may mean is the coconut oil it contains is 100% virgin, but that is not the sole ingredient.There is enough oil in it though to make this a very good leave-in product.  It is not going to make your hair greasy as long as you use it properly; spray in/work in a little, don't go wild with it.My daughters all have long hair and love it, to help restore the sheen to their hair after using blow dryers, straightening irons, etc.IngredientsWater, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*Û , Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Coconut Acid, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Algae Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail) Extract, Argania Spinosa Kernel (Argan) Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit (Rosehip) Oil, Tocopherol, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum Extract, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) *Certified Organic Ingredient. Û Fair Trade Ingredient.

502,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My son's long 3a/3b curls are just awesome, but his low porosity hair makes upkeep a disaster.  Detangling is the hardest part because he is so tenderheaded.  I have used everything.  However, when I used the SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Leave-In Treatment detangling produced very little tears with curls that were hot n' poppin'!After doing our usual wash day routine using the entire SheaMoisture Low Porosity line.  (Shampoo, Conditioner, and Manuka Honey Deep Conditioner).  I then detangled using the 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Leave-In Treatment.  Lastly, I detangled more using the SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Style Milk.  I then sealed a little bit with SheaMoisture FlaxSeed Oil and Argan Oil.  (I'm really not an exclusively SheaMoisture girl, it just worked out that way that day)AN ENTIRE WEEK!!  An entire week went by with detangled, moisture locked in curls.  The frizzies stayed away until the end of the week.  Plus, detangling on his tenderhead was so much easier!  So, for him, this was a godsend.  I have used it on my 4C low porosity hair during the week.  I would say my hair didn't really get much of a reaction.  I didn't feel like it was really that moisturizing (admittedly I used it on dry hair which with my 4C low porosity hair is the worst test subject)  But I could see how lightweight it felt on my hair.  For my son, I can't be more happy.Now, at $15 a bottle!  Yeah, no.  I've never paid more than $12 from anything SheaMoisture.  So, when this bottle runs out, I'm going to have to think long and hard about whether I want to continue with this product.  Also, the bottle really isn't conducive to allowing the product to come out.  My hand slips on the bottle because I am working with wet hair and when my hand is wet with water and product it slips.  My bottle also came without a cap.  I saw that other people experienced that too.  So, maybe SheaMoisture should work on sealing the cap on.  That way we know the integrity of the product is still intact.  One other thing I didn't really like was not knowing where this product was going to spray.  Sometimes it sprays everywhere but on the hair.  On the floor, on the curtains, on the walls.  A different spray bottle I think it warranted.  Overall, this product is great for 3a/3b folks, but at $15 I would be trying to find something else, which is a shame because SheaMoisture typically has really great products at decent prices."
503,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love all SheaMoisture products so I knew I would be happy with this one!  I have fine thin slightly wavy hair and find my ends dry out pretty quickly.  I have used the SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave-In Conditioner for about 4 years so when I came across this product I knew I would love it.  With the weather getting cold my hair is getting static-y and this has really helped.  I use this with my other leave-in conditioner but I have also been using it by itself on dry hair when the ends are looking really dry and frizzy or my hair is getting static-y and it works really well.  It leaves my hair feeling smooth, looking shiny, and it smells great.  I love that its a spray bottle because it is less messy than a jar or bottle.  Another great product from SheaMoisture!"
504,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Because my hair is fairly soft, I can’t say I noticed any significant difference in the softening qualities attributed to the Coconut Daily Hydration Leave-in Treatment.  However, its being soft means there is very little natural body, and I did notice after using it that my hair felt as though it had more substance of its own. As with most leave-in products, I would just like to note that it does take longer for your hair to dry.  If you haven’t heard used a similar product before, you’ll have a heads-up.  As a detangler, I felt like it left something to be desired.  I felt like I had to use a lot even with shorter hair. This is the main reason I deducted one star.  The coconut fragrance, clearly stated in the advertising text, is pleasant and not overwhelming, and I always consider it a bonus when there are as few chemical additives as possible. In comparing cost per value, I believe this product is reasonable."
505,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,No more tears!,My 2 year old twirls her hair to go to sleep which creates these massive knots. Then of course with her car seat it looks like a rats nest isn’t he back too. This product has made such a difference! It’s so much easier to brush and even detangling the knots. No more tears here!My 5 year old has long hair and being an active child it often gets into knots and is hard to brush in the evenings. This product has made her hair so much softer and easier to brush.I’ve been using this product for both my girls. I spray it on after they’ve gotten out of the bath. I towel dry their hair and then wait about 10 minutes and apply it. Then I’ll brush their hair. I love the smell and knowing I’m using good quality ingredients on my girls head. We also use the Shea Moisture baby shampoo and body wash. Love these products!
506,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells soooo bad.,"This product smells aweful. As much as they tried to make it more natural… they ruined it with the most overwhelming synthetic fragrance smell possible. It says ""essential oil blend"" but I can assure you there are hardly any essential oils in this. Essential oils have a pleasant scent and rapidly dissapate due to their volatile nature. Synthetic fragrances linger for many hours, as does this product.They ruined a fine product for no reason. Why should my hair smell like sickly sweet fake smell?"
507,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Knock Off, Fake Product","I use this product religiously; I typically buy it at Target or Walgreens and I wanted to try “Subscribe and Save” to save a little money. The bottle on the left without the cap is my bottle, and the bottle on the right is what I received from Amazon. I believe this product is a knock-off. The scent and texture seems similar to the original, but the packaging looks off. Namely, the label is matte and it does not show the same “sulfate free” claim that my original product does. I don’t want to risk causing any damage to my hair or skin so I will be returning this."
508,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this on my daughter's hair to refresh during the week.  She has somewhat coarse, dry hair with 3A/3B curls   I wash it about once a week, spray with water bottle, and add some type of conditioner or detangler, comb through with a vented brush, and scrunch a bit to restore her curls. As a detangler, this works great.  Her hair is very long and the ends get really tangled.  Once I use enough to detangle, this can weigh down her hair a bit so her hair is straighter at the base and her curls aren't as bouncy. A little goes along way with this, so it's a good value.  The spray is pretty localized, so you need to spread it throughout the hair.  I'm not sure why this wouldn't be better in a pump. I love the coconut smell."
509,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I didn't have much expectation for this product and thought there is no way this can moisturize my hair. However, I was pleasantly surprise at how good it worked to an extent. I first tried this on my morning hair which is usually when my hair is the driest after sleeping on it all night (I'm a back sleeper and I don't cover my hair and my current pillow case isn't satin). I sprayed it on the back of my hair and the ends which are the driest and it instantly gave it the moisture it needed that I used it to re-wet my hair instead of water and then out the door I went. My hair stayed in its style as expected and did not get dry as the day prolong which was awesome. I used it this way for several more days. Next, I tried it one night after I washed  my hair and was too lazy to put in the Jamaican Castor Oil leave-in conditioner . I quickly spray this in and didn't work it through too much in my hair and just went to bed. I was pleased that when I woke the morning, my hair felt moisturized, not the same as when I use the cream based leave-in conditioner but definitely not try, I sprayed more on it the morning, but realize there was no way I could just use this product on its own as my styler for the day as it didn't give my hair the moisture it needed to be able to hold up my style for the day without my hair getting dry. Therefore, I had to use my cream-based leave-in conditioner in order to style my hair.This is a good co treatment being it should be used with a cream-based leave i conditioner and NOT by itself unless your looking for a quick moisturizer before bed or staying home as you're lazy to put in the cream based one in your hair. It is also good as a re-wetter for next day hair as you don't need a lot to revive your hairstyle. It's better than other re-wetting products on the market as its liquid is not thick like others. If you're looking to get this to replacement cream-based leave-in conditioners, I would NOT recommend this."
510,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pros and cons,"Disclaimer - I have thick, coarse, curly, ethnic hair and at times, I put in extensions but not over my entire head.As for the smell - This has a nice, soft coconut scent.When you 1st spray it, it's not like a gel spray where you spray and you can't see it. Once you spray this, it will look like you sprayed ""milk"" in your hair so you do have to either run your fingers through or use a comb/brush.It does a decent job at detangling your hair. I don't wash my hair daily (not good for your hair/scalp) so on the days that I don't wash it, these are the steps that I take for unwashed hair (for washed hair, just skip the 1st step).1) Spray my hair with water2) Spray the leave-in conditioner3) Comb hairWithout using any other product but this leave in conditioner, I noticed that it did a nice job on my extensions with keeping it tame. As for my natural, curly hair, it didn't do a great job at keeping the frizz down.Overall, good product."
511,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing I've tried for my curls,"This has absolutely been the best product I've tried for my curls. I've used other products with good results, but after a while, they either changed formula or my hair just stopped reacting the same way. This has been great, though. My curls are soft and don't frizz, and even hold after being in a ponytail. I will say, I am also using TIGI's Catwalk Curl Activator after putting this in. That combo seems to work even better than this alone, but this alone works wonderfully. Also, the bottle says to use on damp hair, but I have put it on dry hair and it soaks in fine. I can't wash my hair more than every few days, so I need to be able to add a touch between washings, and it's worked fine.The only negative: this being a spray....it gets everywhere if I try to spray it directly on. Instead, I spray it into my palm, then apply it to my hair."
512,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,HALL OF FAME,TOP 50 REVIEWER,Shea Moisture can do no wrong in my book. The ingredients are always high quality and my hair loves them. The consistency is like heavy cream. It has a pleasant coconut scent. The leave-in boosts my hair's hydration and attacks tangles. It also works well as a refresher spray if you water it down a little.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
513,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing and keeps curls hydrated and defined.,My daughter has extremely curly hair that dries out quickly and becomes frizzy anytime it’s not wet. We’ve been using the leave in treatment from sheamoistire every other morning when styling her hair before school. First I spray water and completely brush out all the tangles then I add a little more water and the leave in treatment to the lower half of her hair and use my hands to work it in. First of all it smells amazing if you like the smell of coconut and it definitely helps to define her curls and help keep them hydrated so her hair doesn’t become frizzy.
514,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!!!,"I really love this stuff, especially the scent!! And my hair is soooo soft now!! I highly recommend this product!"
515,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not really sure what this leave-in is supposed to do.  It doesn't de-tangle and it really doesn't help with styling.  The only thing good I can say is that it smells REALLY good.  Smells like coconut or a pina colada.  I could almost turn it up and drink it!  That's about it.
516,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for fine hair,This is 3 stars for fine hair. I have very fine hair and this weighed it down and made my hair look greasy (with light application). It did make my hair feel really nice and soft though. The smell is standard coconut. I think this would be great for people with thick and curly hair that want definition to their hair.
517,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,I got this for my daughter who struggles with rinsing conditioner. I suggested she didn't need that and use this leave in conditioner to detangle per instructions. She much prefers this to rinsing conditioner and her hair brushes easily and doesn't look oily.I like that it's free from phosphates. Saves water too. I'm happy; she's happy. Win win.
518,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for wigs!,"I put this is a wig after I washed and conditioned it and it gave it moisture without weighing it down. It smells amazing, but that also causes it to attract bugs. I wore this in my hair on a farm and I was getting attacked by bees that wanted to get in my hair. Id say be cautious when wearing in the summer and outside because of that."
519,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Anything from this line is awesome,"The bottle looks just as pictured. This entire line smells great. This product, in particular, does add moisture to your hair but just keep in mind that it is a very wet product. Thus, it does make your hair very wet while moisturizing it. One it is moisturized, though, it does not stay moisturized for as long as I would like— you have to keep adding this product in order to eep your hair moisturized. The plus is that it is not a greasy product."
520,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"100% pure ingredients, made in the USA!!!  This Coconut Oil Treatment leaves my hair untangled, Soft, Shiny and best of All my hair no longer looks Tired and Dry!!!  Love this stuff....and I smell SO Amazing!!!  The Fresh and Clean Coconut scent stays with you all day long!!!  Excellent, Pure, Wonderful Product!!!  Thank you!!!"
521,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super amazing! I recommend you try it!,Super amazing!! I have super long frizzy wavy hair that I always struggle to detangle. This does a great job detangling and moisturizing it without weighing my hair down or making it greasy. Works on dry and wet hair! Also has a super great fresh coconut smell that’s clean and reminds me of summer. Love it very much and highly recommend
522,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had to return it!!!,"I thought since this was advertised as organic, it would not have artificial fragrance - WRONG. I am highly fragrance sensitive, and this fragrance was overpowering to me. I had to immediately rinse it out. It is also advertised as a ""spray."" Mine did not spray, but rather it squirted - all over my shirt."
523,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works best on damp to wet hair- the product is somewhat thick so this way you're not having to use a ton of product and it detangles really good. Smells good. Even though it's thick, it's not to the point of making it hard to spray out of the bottle. It's been working great for my 8-year-old-mixed-princess. She has a sensory disorder so having a good product to help detangle as gently as possible is a must! Also one that's going to condition and help keep her curls healthy 👸🏾"
524,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this conditioner more than I thought I would.  Most tend to weigh down my hair, but I haven't experienced that with this product. I put a little on my hands before blow-drying my hair, and it helps to protect it from the heat and to add some volume and texture. I find that throughout the day, my hair feels sleeker and thicker.  I don't use a lot, just a little, mostly on my ends."
525,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,I use this on myself and my son (whonis biracial with curly hair) this detangles and restores his curls like no other product! By far one of my favorites from Shea Moisture and the smell is amazing! This is best for thicker textured hair as it is very moisturizing product.
526,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,No cap!,No cap!! Where's the cap! Can't travel with this.
527,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the natural ingredients,Excellent product. It has a lot of natural ingredients that are great for your hair. My hair is so soft after using it. I use it directly after I get out of the shower. It’s not too overwhelming either so you don’t have to worry about your hair getting greasy.
528,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,This spray leave in milky conditioner is made from 100% virgin coconut oil and it helps hydrate my hair. I use it fresh out of the shower after towel drying my hair. I use liberal spritzes and saturate my hair and comb it through. The scent is light and it helps keep my hair from out of control frizziness and helps keep it shinier.
529,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprised honestly,I actually really like this. Me and my son have 4b hair and he has dreads i have a fro. It really moisture nicely and smells amazing. I use it morning  daily and I use aloe vera juice spray at night. His dreads look way better.
530,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,So moisturizing!,"We put this in my daughter's hair like a detangler and then braid her hair. She desperately needs to go a couple of days between washing, so braids are big for us. She gets excited on braid days because she won't have to wash her hair that night. She loves the scent, and I love how it works and the company that it comes from. Decent ingredients, and great performance. Love this!"
531,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I never walk away from a shower without putting this in after!,Best hair care product I’ve ever used! I used to have issues with my hair getting that greasy feeling the day after showering and would wash my hair daily(not great for your hair) since I’ve been using this leave in treatment my hair is soft for days and smells amazing!! I can’t leave the bathroom after a shower without brushing this in first or I can TELL THE DIFFERENCE. This is my only daily treatment aside from shampoo/conditioner
532,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This coconut oil spray is great for my curly hair. It doesn’t spray very well like a fine mist, it’s more of a squirt than a spray, but that is ok for my needs. I use it on wet hair before I dry it. It’s not suitable for dry hair unless you must it with a spray bottle of water a little."
533,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My son loves having long hair but hates brushing it, hence we’re always in the market for anything that will make brushing easier. While I’m not a huge fan of the lingering coconut scent it leaves in his hair, he doesn’t mind it, and it does seem to make the whole brushing process a lot less painful."
534,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells nice,"Detangles your hair leaving it soft and smooth.  I also love the fragrance, but to me, it doesn't smell like coconuts at all, Instead, I think that it smells like tropical plumeria. I don't have curly or textured hair but it works for me so I plan to keep on using it."
535,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING PRODUCT...,I love this leave in. I have been transitioning for a little over a year and usually wear my hair straight. I used it for the first time yesterday after washing my hair to detangle! My hair was so soft manageable and smelled amazing.
536,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Left hair crunchy and smells musty,"Was looking for a clean ingredient leave-in that would would help manage my curls .  It left them crunchy and dry feeling.  It only smells good in the bottle.  After applying, it smelled super musty and gross, like suffocatingly musty.  Absolutely hated it.  I won't throw it away because I don't want to waste the money, but it will literally be emergency use only."
537,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is Nice leave in conditioner and it smells great. My daughter has very long curly hair that tends to tangle -this is good to put in it to keep her hair nice and soft. The smell is the best part!
538,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I put actual coconut oil in my hair, but this is an upgrade. It works quickly and leaves my hair soft and shiny. Smells good too. Works good for dry damaged hair."
539,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,One my of favorites,Arrived quickly in the mail. Smells absolutely amazing and keeps my hair feeling soft and moisturized for hours. Will continue to purchase this product.
540,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff is magic!,Reason for 4 stars is the scent is too overpowering.

555,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent, but wouldn’t buy again.","Okay, so I was hoping for a conditioning spray, and what I got was a cream conditioner in a spray bottle that comes out as a stream. Because it doesn’t spritz, I can’t apply it directly on my hair, so I apply it to my hands and attempt to comb it thorough. The smell is AMAZING, and this product does help with frizz control, but I haven’t noticed any moisturizing qualities on my ends. I would also say that because of the way the product applies, it doesn’t work great as a de-tangler either because you have to comb it through with your hands to actually disperse the product. So it doesn’t penetrate the knots. It’s just okay. I will use it, but I won’t buy it again."
556,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just wasn’t for me,"I’m sure this is a good product for others but it wasn’t for my hair. I have straight brunette 20 inch hair and I wanted something that would help me brush my hair easily but this kinda did the opposite for me. After spraying it on my hair it started to feel stiff And my hair strands were getting glued together which was very odd and I quickly rinsed it off. Again, I’m sure it’s a good product but it just didn’t work well for my personal use."
557,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Weighs your hair down,"Leaves your hair oily. Be aware of that expecially if you use it on freshly washed hair. I washed my hair and sprayed this on and my hair instantly feel heavy and oily.I have very thick, curly AND wavy hair by the way. It gets very tangled because of the the two types of hair I have."
558,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"There are less expensive, better products","This product smells good, but it takes a lot of sprays to reduce tangles...so many sprays that your hair becomes heavy and flat. I have found that Garnier Fructus Sleek and Shine works SO MUCH BETTER and is MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE."
559,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,smells good feels lightweight,"I apply it mostly to my ends and near scalp flyaways. It smells great and feels lightweight. I don't find it particularly helpful as a detangler, but is OK as a leave-in conditioners. Hair sucks this stuff up: the bottle goes faster than I would prefer, which is why I give it 4/5 stars. Wish the bottle came with greater volume of product."
560,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would highly recommend,I really love this stuff. Only thing I’ve ever used that has 1) made my hair feel soft 2) helped any tangles 3) smelled super good && 4) did not make my hair feel greasyI will be buying more once I run out for sure.
561,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Actually does what it says !!,This leave in conditioner works amazingly especially considering how cheap it is. It adds shine detangles and softens the hair and has a nice coconut smell. I love it. I used it on dry hair and brushed it through and when it dried was still silky and flowy and not sticky at all.
562,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,No spray,"Smells great. Unfortunately, I am one of the lucky ones that got a spray bottle that doesn't spray. Totally defeats the idea of a spray leave in conditioner if you have to completely put it on using your hands. Doesn't distribute nicely that way."
563,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,No picture I just now got it and used it . Great product!,It smells like coconut which I like and it works like it says it came before the time it said  and I am happy . I would buy again.
564,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Soft, shiny and less frizz","I love this leave in treatment! It made my hair softer, less frizzy, and overall more manageable. It made styling my hair easier and it even added some shine. It also smells wonderful. I would definitely recommend this product!"
565,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,Honestly just buy this! It’s seriously life changing!!! I tried countless hair products and this one is literally magical! My hair is pretty damage and dry and this product makes my hair look like if I have never dyed or bleached it before. After I shower I spray this on ends and it leave them super soft . I’m so blown away from how much of a difference it makes with my hair.
566,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great Shea Moisture product!,"Great leave in conditioner. Love smell, not overpowering. I already use Shea moisture products, will order again. Recommended for my curly sisters. I have 4b/c low porosity hair. Works well with my loc method."
567,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Keeps my hair soft!!,"I always apply this around 5-15 minutes after a shower and let me tell you, my hair becomes super soft once it dries! Before using this, my hair always felt slightly crisp or dry, but this moisturizes my hair and keeps it soft. It also smells really appealing. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair now ever since I’ve started using this. I recommend this!"
568,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just incredible!!,"Turns dry damaged hair into silky luxury!! And, smells divine enough to want to eat it!"

603,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,watered down,"I've purchased this product before, but the item I received today was watered down and didn't have a cap on the bottle. Fortunately I still had a bottle that was almost empty. The little leftover in that bottle was compared to the new bottle and  I saw immediately that someone added water to it because it was so thin. Normally this product is thick enough where you only need a few squirts, but with the new bottle the product came out so quickly it was like water. I will be returning it."

613,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Better for thick or coarse hair,This product weighs down thin fine hair and makes it look greasy.

La etiqueta viene borrosa, no le encuentro la caducidad... Cambiaré mi opinión cuando se me cambie el producto :( espero que no todos vengan así con este proveedor"
618,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Types 100% Extra Virgin 8 oz,Size: 8 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,This is ok but leave hair greasy . I liked the Jamacian Black Caster oil range leave in conditioner than this one .
0,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"2c 3a hair, fan of the product but not the fragrance.","I have a very very sensitive scalp, and low porosity, 2c/3a hair thats fairly thin and very dense. This gave me good moisture that did not weigh me down, but compared to the “knot today” from aunt jackies I usually use, i needed to use ALOT of product. But the moisture did penetrate deeper and not leave a sticky residue or any buildup.I ended up mixing this with jojoba oil and using it as a leave on under a cap for like an hour and my hair has never been that soft.My biggest qualm with this and honestly every shea moisture product is that the fragrance is SO heavy. Fragrance is a really bad irritant that can mess your skin up, give you allergic contact dermatitis and even sensitize you to other products over time.People act like essential oils are better for this but... essential oils are VERY concentrated volatile oils and you should not ever apply them directly to your skin. People act like natural unprocessed ingredients are always better. Y’all there are natural things that would have no problem killing you and penicillin isn’t exactly natural.I did not realize how much fragrance was in this product until i used it and ladies it’s alot. Fragrance really shouldn’t be listed as a main ingredient. I wish they had other options.The conditioner seems to work ok as i rinse some out and apply it to my hair not my skin, but whenever i use shea moisture shampoo it eventually breaks my scalp out into a rash and it’s not fun. Sometimes i even get breakouts along my scalp from the shampoo because it’s basically just parfum with some mild cleansers in it.They make the stuff that works the best for my hair but it always smells SO freaking intense and breaks my scalp out and that’s just such a bummer. Also shea moisture actually seems like a really nice ethical company, and i wish they made safer products for people with sensitive skin so i could actually buy from them instead of all these other beauty companies that sell progressivism and use women and the idea of helping the environment as an advertisement but buy ingredients linked to the slave trade, sell skin lightening cream in other countries, and have a rainforests worth of palm oil in every plastic bottle.Sorry for going off like that about conditioner but it’s not really just conditioner.My products arrived on time and were as advertised.I wouldn’t recommend this if you have kinky curls or coils, but thinner curls and waves like mine would probably do well with this product."
1,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Strong fragrance, moisturizing product","I really like this product line, but their strong scents get overwhelming for me. I’ve learned to purchase Shea Moisture shampoos & conditioners that list the “fragrance” near the end of the ingredient list, rather than near the top, as then the scent is not as strong.I purchased this one after looking at the ingredient list that is posted. Unfortunately when I received the bottle, I saw the ingredient list here is different than the one on the bottle. And as I suspected after smelling the conditioner, the ingredient list has fragrance as one of the top ingredients.I’ve emailed the company before, and even though their ingredient lists say the fragrance is an “essential oil blend,” it is actually a blend of fragrance with essential oils. So for those who are sensitive to fragrance, this is important to know."
2,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Recommended for thicker, curlier hair types","This product did not work for me as I had hoped. I bought this product because I have fine, wavy/curly hair, and was seeking a silicone-free conditioner to help restore my curl pattern. I chose SheaMoisture for the price, coconut scent, and reviews on other hair websites. After using for a week, I found that this conditioner left my hair smelling great, but did not rinse out easily. This product might work better on thicker, curlier hair."
3,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for fine hair,"I've been using SheaMoisture products for many years. I've tried a lot of different shampoos and conditioners. Some worked great, others left me disappointed. This conditioner is one of my favorites. I have long, fine, dry hair and this conditioner does a marvelous job at conditioning without leaving build up I've experienced with other SheaMoisture products."
4,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good, but not great.","I love the SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil line, but this conditioner just really doesn't do much for my 4b natural African American hair. It's a pretty good product, but I like their 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Leave-in Conditioner spray better."
5,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands down my favorite product from Sea Moisture,"I Looooooooove this product OMG!! Hands down my favorite product from Sea Moisture! Well this and the 10 in 1 conditioning mask!! This is very moisturizing and hydrating and gentle enough to use daily. I use it for my braids out and deep conditioning. I have verrry dry hair, so it takes a good product to quench my locks but with this conditioner, my hair is soft, moist and very happy!"
6,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,For all hair types.,"I love the smell of this hydrating conditioner.

7,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product,"The company delivered the shampoo instead of the conditioner, which I ended up buying at a CVS or Walgreen's. They usually offer buy one get one 50% off for Shea moisture. I absolutely love this line. It's my new favorite, it makes the hair so easy todetangle and style. I use it for my daughter as well. 3C/4A hair"
8,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was pretty expensive but I’m a sucker for coconut shampoo and ...,"I went to the store maybe two weeks ago and bought the shampoo alone. It was pretty expensive but I’m a sucker for coconut shampoo and I wanted to try something new. I really was not expecting such an amazing product. Since the I have gotten the conditioner, the body lotion, the body wash, another lotion, and already have some other products from them in mind. All through out every single one is a winner.I’m a man, with curly hair, I keep a medium length hair style and also use the shampo & conditioner on my beard."
9,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works for fine hair,"I have always hesitated to use hair conditioner as I have fine hair and it tended to not hold a curl when I used it. However, I noticed that my hair has been very dry and lacked shine recently. After reading the reviews, I decided to give this conditioner a try and I’m so glad I did.  My curls are more defined without frizz and my hair is moisturized and shines. I can use this every day with great results. Highly recommend."
10,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't detangle,"I loved the shampoo version of this conditioner and thought I would love the conditioner but I was sadly wrong. The scent is great but I was hoping that this conditioner would detangle my gnarls after surfing and moisturize it after a day in the sun. That clearly wasn't the case...I have straight hair, so I usually don't have any problems finding a conditioner that would help detangle but this didn't hit the mark..."
11,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,This conditioner is great once a week after I wash my hair I put a bunch of this conditioner in my hair and put my shower cap on and let it soak in my hair omg my hair is so soft and hydrated. I will continue to get this conditioner thank you.
12,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No bad chemicals and works great with Curly Girl Method, or not","If you are following the CGM you know that no-poo is a big deal. Followers are to scrub scalps and use this conditioner as a cleanser (Wen does this) I like to switch it out with an organic cleansing shampoo as I don't want buildup on my sensitive scalp. Shea Moisture makes amazing super affordable products for your hair, face, and body. Get it. You'll love itPS this smells like coconut FYI"

16,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,No More Tangles!,I’ve been using this conditioner for quite some time.

18,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,leaves hair shiney and moisturized,I use this in combination of other brands for shampoo and leave in conditioner but this is the best all natural conditioner I've used. I also like hair food products but I think this might be a little bit more moisturizing.
19,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,BUY THIS FROM A PHYSICAL STORE!,So nasty. I received my conditioner without a safety seal and it looked like someone has pumped out some of the product then wiped away the evidence. So nasty!

21,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,I don't like the scent but it doesn't condition the hair. You can't even run your fingers through your hair with the conditioner in.

100,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,HALL OF FAME,TOP 10 REVIEWER,"I have been using Shea Moisture products on and off for several years. I have used pretty much everything they have to offer for hair and skin. I tend to stay away from hair products that coat the hair with silicone. This entire line is silicone free, and is easy to find online and in stores. Says that it is good for daily use, so I expected a light conditioner and it is. I have super long (nearly waist length) thick, multi textured hair (waves, curls, sometimes almost straight). When my hair is shorter, it is curlier. Despite the length, it acts like curly hair- a little frizz, a little dryness, a little mayhem. I would say this is one of their lighter formulations. The viscosity is more lotion like than some of their super thick creams of the past which were near impossible to pump out. For me it pumps out from the bottle easily. I add a generous amount to wet hair, and let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse well. My hair is lightly moisturized and smells nice.This is also one of the lightest in terms of fragrance. I have sometimes found their products to be overly scented (shea butter aroma and essential oils blend). This one smells extra fresh, clean, and light. The light scent lingers on the hair and just smells nice. I am prone to scent nausea, and this doesn't trigger any sick feels or headaches. Of course, you may have different opinion and experience.Additional uses:--I have used their conditioners as leave-in conditioners, and this one is a really good contender for that since it is extra light.--scrunching in a little after hair dries (or next day) to refresh style, smooth frizzies, and add a little scented freshness and  moisture.--I haven't tried it yet, but I have also made detangling spray using a squirt of their conditioner along with some water in a spray bottle.--C.0.-wash (conditioner only wash). I don't care to wash my hair daily, maybe 3-4x a week. I do like to shower daily. On non hair wash days, I aim to not get my hair wet. Usually once a week on a non shampoo day I will wet my hair and just condition it. This does not clean the hair, but it does rinse out some environment build up, and adds a level of freshness and moisture by just conditioning it. Get hair really really wet- like, pretend you are shampooing the hair and cleaning the scalp, then wring out hair, add conditioner, let sit, then rinse really well.I have another line I prefer, but Shea Moisture is my go-to second line. It has been there for me for many years, and it is always a treat to try something new. Most of their products fair OK on the EWG database, for those that are curious.Ingredients: Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*^, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycerin (Vegetable), Cetrimonium Chloride, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Rosa Canina Fruit (Rosehip) Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel (Argan) Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Coconut Acid, Acacia Senegal Gum Extract, Tocopherol, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail) Extract, Algae Extract, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) *Certified Organic Ingredient ^ Fair Trade Ingredient"
101,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Might just add it to my repertoire...,"I have been using this for about a month now.  I have used a lot of Shea Moisture products over the years with some good results and some not-so-good results.  I don't wash my hair daily, I have 4c low-poristy hair that requires all the natural oils I have so washing daily it not a good idea.I initially used this as directed as a wash out conditioner.  It was fine, but nothing beats my favorite Giovanni's Smooth as Silk deep moisture conditioner.  But I was out of my leave in and decided to try this in a pinch. It actually works great as a leave on.  I mist my hair in the morning, finger through a small amount of this and go.  I have even used a bigger amount for my twist out.  I have noticed that the hair is more pliable and retains moisture a bit better than my other leave in (another Shea product, ironically).The scent in fine, not too cloying especially if you don't slather on."
102,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,HALL OF FAME,TOP 50 REVIEWER,I've been using Shea Moisture products since I went natural several years ago. This conditioner gives your hair the moisture it needs without weighing it down. It leaves hair feeling soft and moisturized. You could also use it as a leave-in. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for reading this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.
103,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works really well as an ""everyday"" conditioner","So, the reason I put ""everyday"" in parenthesis is because I don't wash mine or my daughter's hair everyday. lol However, when I do, this conditioner works really well on her (my daughter's) long, curly hair. Her hair is like a 3a/b curl pattern and it's on the fine side so while I do like to use a deep conditioner at least once every few weeks, I don't like to use them every single time I wash  her hair because i feel it is a bit too much/heavy for her hair imo. This works great on her hair. I've had good luck with shea moisture products on her hair. It's one of my go-tos. I prefer shea moisture over Cantu products any day. The Cantu products are awful and drying on her hair. If you've been using Cantu products and are still struggling with dryness and stuff, I'd recommend trying out shea moisture instead."
104,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I really love this conditioner-the smell is AMAZING! If you love the smell of coconut products, you will love the smell of the conditioner. I don’t know how they get it to smell so good without using artificial fragrance, but it says the fragrance is just essential oils! That’s important, because “fragrances” can have lots of dangerous chemicals added. The smell actually stays in your hair after it’s dried too, which is awesome !I have curly, extremely dry, very frizzy hair. I have to use a deep conditioner every time I wash. Although moisturizing, this conditioner definitely can’t replace my deep conditioners. But it’s not made for that. As a daily conditioner for normal hair, it’s awesome! It didn’t weigh my hair down, it helped with the frizziness, and it smells amazing!! I definitely recommend trying it!"
105,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shea moisture has always been a reputable brand and I've used their products in the past. I used this conditioner as a leave in. I know it wasn't intended for that but I needed something to style my wet hair on short notice. It made my hair manageable to style. I left it in for days and my hair was left feeling visibly soft but it didn't help control the frizz. I later used it to co-wash my hair before a blowout and it made it super easy to detangle. Even after rinsing I was able to blow out my hair easily and it was nearly bone straight so I'd say it helped to really moisturize my hair.
106,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love all SheaMoisture products and this definitely didn't disappoint.  I have fine thin hair that gets very dry in the  cooler months and this conditioner has definitely helped bring it back to life.  It smells great, not too overwhelming, and provides good moisture without weighing my hair down or making it greasy.  I like the pump top as well.  I use this in combination with their leave-in conditioner and it keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  Great product, would definitely recommend!"
107,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,This is an amazing conditioner and as like many other shea moisture products the coconut scent in this is fantastic.I have thick hair that is coarse in some parts - this conditioner really moisturizer my hair.  Since it contains coconut oil it can feel greasy if you do not rinse this out thoroughly - but when used correctly it leaves the hair soft and manageable and smelling amazing!This is a great product to add moisture to dry hair - I think it is best for thicker coarser hair as it really coats the hair.
108,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have been using shea moisture products for the passed 5 or 6 years. I have never tried this product until now. My hair type is  colored, very long, dry and curly (frizzy) I usually use the orange labeled product but I think I actually like this one better. The smell is really nice- it smells to me like a salon shampoo/conditioner mixed with coconut. I had to use around 15-20 pumps with my hair type. It made my hair feeling softer and more hydrated! This one overall is probably my favorite product if theirs now!"
109,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I came back to update this review to say in the beginning it seemed to be great for my daughter who is mixed (black/white) but her hair started to become really dry and it hadn't been that way before. Only change was switching to this and a couple other products from the line consistently for a while. I've stopped using them and have been using different products for months now and her hair has bounced back.It does smell good, definitely a coconut based scent. The push-down spout is a little slim and with the conditioner being thick when in the shower or at the sink with wet hands it's a little tricky and slick to grasp."
110,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,do not buy!!,"I really genuinely thought shea moisture was I good shampoo. I was so excited to use it , but after I used it it left my hair like something was it it. It was as if you melted butter , poured it on you head and let it dry.  And as soon as your hair is dry it starts to look oily. I have very oily hair and thought this would help but I was wrong. Please save your money and do not buy this shampoo! The only good thing was the scent. The scent was amazing though!"
111,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,It does not work,"My 6 year old has lots of fine, long hair. I purchased this hoping it would be a good quality products and work well. It does not work. My daughter’s hair is still a tangled mess afterwards. I used some dollar store conditioner that I had on hand and it worked better. It wasn’t cheap, so I won’t throw it out. Maybe it will work as a shave lotion…???"

The coconut oil contains antioxidant vitamin E to nourish hair and natural triglycerides to help hair retain moisture.

113,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Conditioner. I am mixed with Black and White and have 3b/3c type curly hair. I do my detangling in the shower with lots of conditioner and this is perfect. As much as I have to wash my hair, I needed something that was going to re-hydrate it. The smell is a bit much, but I like how the product works. My local store is usually sold out of this stuff so it's great that I can order it online. Would definitely recommend to keep those curls hydrated!"

115,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,This is a creamy conditioner that has a light coconut fragrance. It isn't strong but if I sniff my hair at the end of the day I can detect the scent. It rinses clean and doesn't build up quickly in my hair.It comes in a pump bottle which is perfect for the shower.At the time of this review the retail price was around $8 for a 13 oz bottle which is reasonable for the quality especially since it is Fair Trade certified.

119,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love the Virgin Coconut Oil line by Shea Moisture.  I use the products on my daughter's hair and they work like a dream.  This is no exception and it smells delicious.  I also love the pump.  Very moisturizing without weighing hair down with a lot of left over residue.
120,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,This conditioner smells like a tropical vacation! I love Sheamoisture products because they have natural ingredients and don't have silicones and waxes to fake your hair looking good. This conditioner is light enough that I've used it as a leave in with great results.
121,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This works really well on my dry curly hair.

Also, I had a lot more shedding, both in shower and after use."
125,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like straight fragrance,"Very intense fragrance smell. I don't get why they have to load the bottle with so much fragrance given that most of the ingredients are natural and smell great on their own - are they trying to cover something up? I can smell it in my hair days later, and I'm a guy with short hair."

It does not do much more for my hair than that, however. If my hair is dry and brittle, this is a quick fix but does not last long."
130,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"I have thick, fine hair and suffer from Psoriatic dermatitis, so I have to use prescription shampoo that is very drying and steroid foam that is very greasy. This conditioner has improved the condition of my hair, helps detangle in the shower so I am seeing less hair fall, and has even made my gray hair more manageable (recently decided to stop covering my gray..) and soft. Love this product!"
131,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely does not detangle hair,This is one if the worst conditioners I’ve ever used.

133,Sheamoisture Daily Hydrating Conditioner For All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best cruelty free conditioner I’ve used yet!,"My hair is very thick, pretty unruly and usually hard to manage.  This conditioner has been a lifesaver.  I only use beauty and bath products that are safe and never tested on animals.  That limits a lot of brands for me and and I’m usually left disappointed when it comes to conditioner.  Shea has been the best I’ve ever used.  I don’t need a huge amount (two pumps is just fine and my hair is pretty long), The price is perfect, no animals are harmed and I love the scent!  My hair is left shiny and way easier to manage after each use."

I am already noticing a difference after using this and the shampoo after 2 washes! My hair is softer and smells nice for 2-3 days!

0,SheaMoisture 100 percent Virgin Coconut Oil For All Hair Types Daily Hydration Finishing Oil Serum Silicone-Free 4.1 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Hair Oil,"I can make my own hair oil but I was traveling and needed something in a leak proof packaging and this came wrapped in a plastic baggie. It’s mostly all natural oils with a little bit of fragrance and I use it bc I have 2b-3a hair and I use the co-wash method and my hair is very long. The ends get cry dry. I’m in Hawaii for work and I find that this smell and the moisture factor makes this oil my favorite commercially made, curly girl approved oil for post washing. I add a teeny bit to my roots and I work this into my hair as I brush it out, let air dry or wrap into a protective hair style like braids or twists after I wash it. On non-wash days I use a little bit on my ends and on my flyaways. It leaves it very shiny."

Try putting a plastic seal around the top like other fluid products, or maybe a seal on top when you first open it.

0,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great eco friendly shampoo on a budget,"FIRST TIME USERS PLEASE READ:Bar shampoo that is natural takes time for you hair to adapt to, especially if you were using shampoos with sulfates before. It takes about a month for your hair basically to detox and then the softness you get is beyond imaginable. Use vinegar, water, and rosemary rinses one a week or couple times a month as a complimentary conditioner. Also, you have to brush the oil from your scalp down your hair to distribute the beneficial oils your scalp produces. If not, the hair was n the scalp can seem oily. It is extra work but better for the environment and health.I love this brand in general. This was the first time using their bar shampoo. It’s a great smell. I have short hair so it will last me probably 3 months. I’m still detoxing from using a different shampoo before because I switched back to bottle shampoo which I know is a waste of money. I use this shampoo on my 1 year olds hair and it looks and feels so lush afterwards. I switched her to bar shampoo too because even the natural baby shampoo were drying out her hair a little more than I liked even though I don’t want it everyday."
1,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded expectations...,"I was afraid to try this so for months I continued using liquid shampoo. It's been three washes now (I use it on my scalp and condition the ends) and I am blown away. Typically I wash my fine 1A hair every other day because the roots become oily, not with this product. I also have less shedding than when I use traditional liquid shampoo. Don't get me wrong, your hair feels quite different while rinsing in the shower and as it dries than when using traditional liquid shampoo but the results have been increased volume and shine. I will return with an update and picture soon!"
2,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful,I bought this for travel while out of the country. I am in quarantine for 2 weeks and it's only day 4 and my hair is heavy and greasy after using this product. The more you use it the worse the build up. It doesn't rinse out.  I am so disappointed. I look like a street rat hobo and still have 10 more days until I can get something else to wash this crap out. Do mot even think about buying this crap. You will regret it I promise.
3,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Shampoo Bar Ever.,"This is hands down the worst shampoo bar I have ever tried. I used it twice.. and I regret it terribly. The first time I used it my hair felt strange, unmanageable and sort of gritty. I tried it one more time and it only got worse. I have now washed my hair twice in two showers (four times) and there is a still a weird residue in some parts of my hair. It was a complete waste of money and my hair is in horrible condition. I used their recommendation based on my hair type on their website. I was between a 1A and 1C and this bar was recommended for both. This is incredibly disappointing because I love their other products and their company."
4,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Switch to bars!,"Very cleaning and moisturizing shampoo bar. It doesn’t have an overwhelming scent, and really lets my hair feel natural and not weighed down. It lasts a lot longer than shampoo bottles too."

6,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite solid shampoo bar,"The smell is incredible! I love it. I've been using solid shampoo for years and this one washes and rinses more like a liquid shampoo than the other bars I've used. My hair is straight and fine and tends to get greasy fast. If I use this bar alone, I only shampoo about 2-3 times per week."
7,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horribly drying.,Extraordinary drying. Suitable only as laundry soap.
8,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s like soap,"Although the main function of the shampoo is to clean, if you have long hair and like moisture, this is not the product for you. If you like a very clean result, then you will get it. This shampoo bar cleans great, but you will need conditioner afterwards so it doesn’t leave you with dry hair."
9,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted to love it, bad fit for me.","I love the smell and the size of this shampoo bar, as well as how it leathers up.

10,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great shampoo bar.,I have wavy hair on the thicker side and this bar worked great. It left my hair very soft and moisturized. Using a shampoo brush also really helped with removing any residual product left in scalp.
11,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Made hair greasy,"I really wanted to love this. It smells wonderful and I generally like the products from this company. However, this shampoo made my hair incredibly greasy. Greasy as in it looked and felt like I hadn’t showered in days greasy. I thought maybe I didn’t wash it out well, but even after a couple more uses and extra rinsing, it didn’t get any better."
12,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,I have no complaints. Smells good. Cleans my hair. It was very large.

16,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but not for my hair,"I love this...as a face soap. Not for the hair. It made my hair look like I hadn’t showered for a few days. This might not be a bad thing, it might actually be moisturizing it? In any case, I used this as a face soap and I love it for that, I will probably cut it into quarters for travel. It certainly doesn’t dry out my skin. I don’t hate it, I just don’t like it as a shampoo. The coconut scent is very light. I like that there is no plastic!"

18,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best shampoo bar I've tried yet!,"I've tried about 5 different brands/types of shampoo bars, and this is by far my favorite. It doesn't leave my hair gritty or waxy, it does a good job at removing oil, it works up into a lather so you know when you've used enough product, AND I don't even need conditioner after it because it is so hydrating!"
19,"100% Virgin Coconut Oil Clay Shampoo Bar, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Felt wonderful from the first moment.,I like the bar better than. Bottle. My hair immediately responded to this shampoo the moment I started rubbing it into my hair.  This method seems to get my hair cleaner faster and delivered moisture to my scalp quickly. Love it.

0,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,changed ingredients to toxic ones---,"Phenoxyethanol is so high up in the ingredient list. I bought this specific shampoo because the photo shows ingredients without it. It didn’t say Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) anymore. Phenoxyethanol causes central nervous system damage in exposed infants, and it’s human carcinogenic. Phenoxyethanol causes adverse effects on the brain and nervous systems.This chemical is okay-ish for adults but is advised not to use on infants...It sucks because other than a super toxic ingredient, I really loved this shampoo. She smelled like an angel baby."

Like, I won't wash my face and makeup off with anything else, this stuff is pure gentle magic! I'm actually here to buy more bottles right now. Buy it!"
6,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Wash,This shampoo and body wash works really well. My child's hair is shiny and tangle free.

I have a baby girl and 2 baby boys, all of them with long hair. This is the only thing I use to wash their hair with. You only need a little bit of it and it lathers alot.

8,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,FAKE. DONT BUY,This item is fake & it’s really not a joke as it’s for baby’s. THANK GOODNESS I still had some of the real shampoo left & instantly seen it wasn’t the real product. Color of liquid & bottle label is completely different. This is absolutely horrible

Phenoxyethanol is so high up in the ingredient list. So disappointed that the item now contains the bad stuff Phenoxyethanol and unknown fragrance.

10,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Rashes & irritates eyes,"After 1 month of use, this started giving my daughter rashes all over her belly. Had to discontinue use. Smells weird, also. A scent that smells like glue or old hair gel. Definitely irritates babies eyes. My daughter whined a lot when it would run down her face as I was washing it out of her hair. Not a good product. Left her hair very dry, too. Burts bees baby product was better and did not hurt my baby’s eyes or skin."
11,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Suffocating Old Lady Smell,"I was excited to finally get this because it was recommended by MamaNatural and I'd been looking for a natural baby wash. Unfortunately, I expected it to be rather scentless...and the Sweat Pea fragrance in it is overbearing. Should have read the description better. I accidentally got a little on my finger while removing the safety seal and now it is all I can smell. Maybe I'm just sensitive to that but the sweat pea is STRONG and I don't want my baby smelling like an old lady who put too much lotion on."
12,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and works awesome.,I’m an adult and I use this for me! I found this by accident in our local discount grocery store. I loved the smell so much I had to get it. I won’t use anything else now. It’s pretty perfect. Lathers good and leaves skin smelling amazing and soft.
13,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not filled to brim,Maybe this is a normal amount but it seemed like it was lacking a little bit of soap at the top as if someone had emptied some of it out. It still had the protective thing under the cap but I couldn't tell for sure if it had been previously used or tested out by someone else before it came to me. This isn't exactly a review of the product but more so the seller or manufacturer because I just felt like the bottle should have been more fully filled.
14,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Great,"I use this on my new born. I wanted to switch it up from the dove head to toe I used on my other kiddo in hope that it doesn’t dry out her African American hair when it thickens out. I love the Dove head to toe but I felt like it dried my first kids hair out (3c/4a type). This smells really good and doesn’t seem to bother her skin. I use this paired with coconut oil and so far so good. Oh yea, did i mention how much I love the smell of this stuff?"
15,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Softness and definition!,"I am never using anything else to wash my daughter's hair.

Just opening up the top made me light headed and sick.  It may be a good product for someone who is not so allergic.  I gave it to a friend who said she could use it.  If you have MCS, like me, don't buy it."
17,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very soft hair and skin,I generally like shea moisture products for its gentleness. This worked very well on my daughter’s hair. It made it very soft and shiny. I like it more than dove and johnson & johnson. I would recommend it.I dont know why reviews are talking about 3 bottles. I see only 1 bottle and got 1 bottle.
18,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wasnt a fan of the smell,This is my first time trying this product and itll honestly be my last. For the price i dont feel that its worth buying. I do not like the smell. The thickness of it is nice. It always looks and comes out like honey. The packaging was good. But this particular scent is just not for me.
19,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Ammonia Smell,"I’m not sure what has changed.. I ordered this product for the first time several months  ago and LOVED it. It smelled amazing, and left my skin smooth. I went to reorder and was sent a product that smelled off. I would describe it as ammonia. Amazon sent me a replacement and though it has less of the ammonia smell, it is nothing like the first time I ordered in terms of scent. Everything else (texture, moisturizing) is the same. I’m super bummed because I’m expecting in May and wanted to use this for our little one. Now I won’t be ordering again."
20,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good in a strong way,Good stuff but overwhelming odor that smells clean and is apparently natural. Just beware there is a strong scent if you are sensitive.

24,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Used for post op showers,This was the perfect soap for post op and would probably be good for a baby but I wouldn’t know. It was sensitive enough for cleaning around my circular tummy tuck incision and I felt safe and clean.
25,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells AMAZING,The most addicting baby ever!

My daughter never had any kind of reaction from this product until last night/today. I used the new bottle that I purchased last week last night and this morning she woke up with hive like bumps.

I’ve been using this product for 2 months and we absolutely love it, not only does it have a  very nice scent but it also leaves my babies hair soft and moisturized. I also use the Shea moisture coconut oil on her hair for extra lovely looking curls"

I actually bought it for my dog as I like to use coconut oil on him. And couldn't have been more impressed with how clean this product made him.

I just had to write this review. I'm going to check their other products for use for myself.."

113,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Strong scent,Way too smelly for a little one. Had to put my guy back in the tub and wash it off because he wouldn’t stop screaming. Definitely going to be a mommy lotion rather than for baby.
114,"SheaMoisture Baby Wash and Shampoo for Baby 100% Virgin Coconut Oil, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy to put moisture back into babies hair!,"I bought this product for my grandchildren (twins!) they are 6 months old and my daughter said she immediately noticed how much softer and healthier the babies’ hair feels. She said it smells great too!Would be great from African American and bi racial babies in my opinion. It may work on all babies, but this would put the moisture back in the hair so curly hair isn’t as puffy or frizzy.Hope it helps!"

0,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky Residue,"I wanted to like this product because I really like the lotion and am trying to be more conscious about the safety of the products we use. But I just didn't. It required three washings in the shower just to get my hair feeling sort of clean and then it left a sticky residue in my hair that made it so heavy and greasy I had to wash it again the next day - which I never do. Once it was dry, I couldn't even run my fingers through it and by the next day it looked like it had been dipped in grease. For reference, I have normal to oily wavy hair that I usually wash about every 3 days."
1,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,"I used this product for a few days, and then I swiftly returned it. It's terrible and misleading. It presents itself as a ""100% virgin coconut oil product"", but the major ingredient in it is shea butter. Just check the back of the label. In fact, it has way too much raw shea butter in there. It WILL weigh down your hair, and it takes forever to wash it out of your scalp.  Also, it left a terrible smell behind for days."
2,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,So worth giving it a chance!,"I love this product. The shampoo alone is great but combined with the conditioner, the results are amazing! My hair is smoother,  shinier and less dry looking. I have baby fine hair so it is hard to find a product that hydrates, but doesn't weigh my hair down. Here it is! I am so glad that I gave it a chance. So worth the price. I just wish the shampoo came in a pump bottle like the conditioner, and that the bottles were bigger."
3,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst ever!!!,This is the worst conditioner and shampoo I’ve ever used in my entire life. It leaves a very thick residue on your hair and leaves your hair feeling dirty and greasy immediately after showering. 0/10 would NOT recommend.
4,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Amazing Hair Product!,"This is a wonderful hair product for the entire family. We have a 3.5 year old and it's great for him as well as my husband, and my own hair. My hair is color treated and yet I never have color fade from it. Our hair is left soft, clean, feels weightless, without oily residue AND there is the benefit of knowing I'm not subjecting my little one or myself to any harmful ingredients. For me personally, being that I already subject myself to coloring my hair, I feel better that I am not adding to unnecessarily with harmful chemicals in my haircare products. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"
5,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed this time around,"This is my second time ordering the coconut oil blend (which smells amazing and does wonders for my hair) but I have been ordering Shea Moisture products for two years now. It is my go to brand and I have never had any issues until today. My package was completely busted open and the shampoo was poured out into the package all over the two bottles themselves . Not only was it a mess to clean up but more than half of the shampoo was gone, at the price I'm paying I am not happy at all."
6,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gentle and effective.,"I finally found a product that isn’t too expensive that doesn’t make my hair super frizzy or difficult to brush. And about a week after I began using it, my dandruff stopped and my hair quit falling out."
7,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,2.0 out of 5 stars,I bought for the Coconut smell and it doesn't smell nothing like Coconut to me.,"I just started using so I don't know if it helps my hair or not. I have long hair down to my waist line. First if all, the bottles are small. Especially, the condinter bottle. So, another words you will run out of condinter before the shampoo. The other thing I live the smell of coconut and anything that reminds me of the beach and sun. I bought because it said ""Coconut Oil"". Instead of my hair smelling like Coconut, I feel like my hair smells like I just got out of a salon getting my hair permed. It stinks!"
8,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,the combo is the best!,"The twosome is a really great value.  It lasts a long time. I originally bought the 32 oz size which lasted me an entire year.  You only need to use about a quarter size of the shampoo and the conditioner.  Was never big on conditioners.  They felt like I just put dirt on my hair.  Always used only shampoos.  Amway sold a really great shampoo & conditioner and then stopped selling it.  So on to search for something similar and a good conditioner that I liked.  I'm very picky about shampoos and conditioners.I have thick shoulder length hair.  Live in Arizona so summers are hot, winters so so. Need shampoos that work well in hot and colder weather.  Luv the SheaMoisture.Leaves the hair very manageable, even the conditioner takes majority of tangles out of the wet hair when running a comb thru it first or blow drying then putting comb thru it.Learned long time ago from a few beautitioners that the shampoo doesn't need to be sudsy to make it clean.  That's a gimmick sales people use to sell their shampoos.  Only need a small amount of shampoo in the palm of the hand to wash the hair with.  Don't use hot water, use warm water.  Hot water will dry the hair out.  Conditioner, don't use a ton of conditioner.  Only use a small amount in palm of hand and gently rub into the hair.  Leave on for few minutes before rinsing.  Same with water temperature.  Use Warm not hot so as not to dry hair out.Do not use high temp on hair dryer when drying hair either.  It will dry the hair out.  Doesn't matter if short, medium length, or long hair, all the same.  Shorter hair use even less shampoo and Conditioner.Was reading some of the reviews from people who called this product worse ever.  They apparently don't know anything about how to wash ones hair or they are a competitors brand.  I have oily hair so I buy the one that suits all types of hair.Shea Moisture does make different shampoos/conditions for different types of hair - oily, dry, hard to manage, straight, curly, etc.  Make sure to buy one that suits your hair type and don't worry if you're not seeing a lot of lather like you think you should.  Lots of lather means absolutely nothing.  Just means takes longer to rinse out.I do recommend this shampoo and is a good deal for the money.  I pd high prices for expensive shampoos/conditioners that were horrible even from beauty salons.  They're just wanting to sell their product(s).  Some have good products.  just don't get hung up on name brands and pricing."
9,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for a clean and soft hair and for kids too!,"I use this product for my 8 yr old daughter. Other kids shampoos would leave her hair dry. I went Sulfate-free, Paraben-free route and it’s helped so much. We use to purchase the JASON coconut one and it seemed so hard to find or too pricey. My daughter loves this one because it also has the coconut scent which is very pleasant and it leaves her fine straight hair so clean and soft. Bottle last a while since it’s just for her to.  I definitely recommend it."
10,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,4.0 out of 5 stars,better than expected,"I have really thin and soft hair with oily roots and drier ends. It's frustrating to find the right shampoo because my hair is trouble. Can you imagine having oily roots/hair on top but then fuzzy and dry hair on the bottom? I was a bit skeptical when my friend recommended the shampoo because I thought the coconut oil was going to make my roots oilier than it already is. After the first few washes, I didn't really like the texture of it. My hands were greasy after applying the shampoo to my hair and it took a few washes to get rid of the residues just on my hands. It takes much longer to rinse my hair after each application. I also noticed that I tend to loose more hair during wash for the first 2 weeks. I decided to stick with it for at least a month because I noticed some surprising results. My roots are a lot drier. My hair is a lot puffier. I love the dryness and volume that it added to my hair. I usually wash my hair once every 2 days and it's usually oily and flat by the middle of day 2, but this shampoo can last me 3 days. My roots do feel oily by touch on day 3, but my hair still looks dry and puffy. By week 3, I started loosing less hair during wash (like A LOT LESS). The shampoo + condition combo also kicked in, my hair is a lot less fuzzy towards the ends. By the end of week 3 and the beginning of week 4, I also noticed a lot of new growth along my hairline. I have really thin hair so I was able to easily spot the new/shorter hair sticking out. I don't know if the shampoo was supposed to aid in hair growth, but that's what's happening with mine now (I can't speak for anyone else obviously).The only thing that I didn't like about the shampoo is probably how ""greasy"" it feels like. Sometimes I am just not sure if I completely rinse off everything. It does feel like I didn't wash it well enough at times when I touch my hair while it's still dam, but it feels perfectly fine after my hair dries. I gave it 4/5 because of this. In general, the shampoo works great for me. My hair is less oily, less fuzzy, and more puffier. I also like the subtle coconut scent. I recommended it to my family as well and so far, they seem to like it as well."
11,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Leavea lots of residue,I do not recommend buying this product. I've been using it for about 2 weeks straight. I wash my hair everyday so I thought I would buy something for everyday use. This leaves so much residue I feel my hair getting sticky and heavy. It doesn't clean through.
12,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture,I have 1B hair. And i know this is mainly used on afro hair but i needed some extra moisture so i figured id try it out. My ends have felt extremely dry the couple of times I've used this. I love that its got a lot of natural ingredients but i can’t imagine that its moisturizing for afro hair if my 1B hair doesn't feel the most moisturized.Im going to keep using it for a couple weeks and will update if my review changes
13,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff,"I normally used Pantene and have for 20+ years but decided to do some research and found this stuff... my hair is softer, I'm not shedding as much hair and i can go my 2 days without my hair feeling oily or crunchy from the gel, mousse and hairspray... with this shampoo it stays softer longer and isnt oily. I'm not a fan of the coconut smell but this just smells fresh to me. Great buy. Buying more of the Shea Moisture products!!"
14,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fine Curly Hair,"I have fine, naturally curly hair, and live in Colorado I.e. very low humidity.  My hair gets so dry, but products meant to hydrate just weighs my hair down. I end up with very dry and frizzy or flat with no body.  I saw a YouTube about these products and decided to try.  So far I am liking them a lot.  My hair has more moisture and I love the clean and not over powering scent.  Very happy so far.  Have only used them twice, but so far so good."
15,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Yuck,Feels like there is dirty residue all over my hair after using. Weighs down my hair.
16,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value,"I love this brand very much, I highly recommend it, it is very moisturizing, gentle on the hair, and does not leave hair tangled."
17,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Company sold out,This company sold out to another one that uses chemicals. I used to love this brand and now I have to find another one. Fragrance used to be a essential oil blend and now it’s not. Harsh chemicals hurt my scalp
18,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good set for summer,I ordered this because summer has been making my hair look and feel like straw and I have read that coconut oil actually contains a protein that can bind to hair. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a bonus sized shampoo and the bottles miraculously weren’t leaking when they arrived. My hair already feels better and was loads easier to detangle. It also smells great!
19,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not moisturizing, more tangles","I was hoping this product would help with moisturizing and getting tangles out. I actually like the shampoo as it seemed to moisturize, but the conditioner seemed to make my hair more tangled than my previous shampoo and conditioner brand. The search for a good moisturizing hair product continues..."
20,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like this product.,"Love this product, so far.... I bought the conditioner first, liked it, then decided to buy the shampoo."
21,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really impressed!,"I have extremely thin hair that is wavy (type 2B I think) but I have a lot of it.  This product isn't heavy at all so my hair doesn't go flat and look ridiculous.  It gives my hair a tremendous amount of volume and really brings curls out, but holy heck does it make my hair frizzy.  I'd recommend some kind of fly away / frizz control with this product, but otherwise it is really great for curly / wavy hair that is on the thinner side."
22,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Type of hair: fine, 2c/3a, short.","The smell is okay, I don't like it but it doesn't stay in the hair which is good for me. If I use too much, the shampoo weights down my hair a little but it doesn't leave my hair greasy, and the conditioner is very good. I think this is a very good product but I would alternate other shampoos because it can weight down your hair."
23,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,3.0 out of 5 stars,No slip,Shampoo is ok. Conditioner has no slip. Hard to detangle 4c hair with. Made my scalp very itchy days later. I had to return.
24,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not purchasing again,"Well, this arrived broken ( the pump was snapped off ) the product itself made my daughter's hair ( curly ) shrink up. I guess the product isn't for her hair type. It is a very heavy conditioner. Probably works great for some, but not us. Plus because the pump was broken it made it a pain to get out of the bottle."
25,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,... over the place and a lot of it was wasted!!,I didn’t try the product yet but I am so unhappy with how messy it was when it arrived to my home 😫 the conditioner was all over the place and a lot of it was wasted!!! :/

29,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is moisturizing.,I like this shampoo for the way it makes my hair feel.

Each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Bad But Didn’t Do Much For My Hair,"The shampoo is creamy but didn’t lather much in my hair, nice smell not strong.

35,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s okay,I don’t hate it but not my favorite. Makes my hair feel thick like I didn’t rinse it good enough. But I make sure I do and it still feels like it is still in my hair.
36,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for thin hair.,"The product seems like it would be great for normal hair.  I personally have thin, dry hair with alot of breakage...it definitely moisturizes your hair for sure...but for my hair type it made my hair look greasy after using.  I wasn't a fan, only for that reason."

Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's the first that's worked on my hair.,"I have fine long thin hair, and this gives me body and it also keeps my static flyway's down.

152,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Missing conditioner!!!,Would have been nice to include the conditioner. So disappointing.
153,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, I rebuy this stuff all the time","I have rarely been a second-time buyer for shampoo and conditioner separately, let alone as a package deal. I bought the big bottles of this shampoo/conditioner at Costco and when I ran out, I immediately ordered them off Amazon because other shampoos and conditioners were just not the same! I rarely style my fine, slightly wavy hair And like to keep it as moisturized and healthy as possible. This shampoo is so nourishing and not harsh with cleansing, it will not give you that stripped squeaky clean feel. And the conditioner is ultra rich and does wonders to flatten out any frizz and seal and coat the hair cuticle for shine. I love this product.I noticed in other reviews some people complain of an oily/residue like substance on your scalp. This shampoo isn’t a harsh cleanser so that’s likely from buildup around your sebum glands and hair follicles. Try a clarifying shampoo or apple cider vinegar rinse before you use these products and that could help them work to your liking."
154,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst shampoo on planet earth. Beware!,"This is literally the worst shampoo I've ever used. I bought it at Sam's club, but had to come warn people about it here....it's THAT bad. I haven't tried the conditioner so can't comment on that. But the shampoo doesn't make your hair feel clean at all. In fact, it makes it feel MORE dirty after you wash....like it leaves some kind of sticky residue in your hair. It also leaves it feeling so weighed down and greasy but also dried out at the same time. It honestly reminds me of how my hair feels if I have used a lot of sticky products or haven't washed it in days. I guess maybe it works for some hair types, but I absolutely hated it. I seriously used it one time and am too scared to even try it again. And I am not someone who is picky about these things. I don't think I've ever truly disliked a shampoo before. For the record, I have pretty normal wavy hair. More on the thick side with drier ends and a somewhat oily scalp."
155,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hair left feeling greasy and heavy!!!!!!!!,"I bought mine from walmart and I've always loved Shea Moisture products. I went to the review section to see if anyone else had the problem I've had. I used to use the shea moisture protein shampoo and the daily moisturizer conditioner. I recently switched to the moisture shampoo and kept the conditioner and it's been hell ever since.No matter how long in in the shower or how much I put in my hair, it leaves my hair feeling stiff, greasy, hard to comb through, almost like I didnt wash anything out of my hair. I've used alot and I've used a little and it is always the same result.My hair is naturally frizzy and wavy and straight and curly and damaged. My hair is pretty crazy and I've been desperately searching for a routine that makes my hair happy, but this stuff ain't it. This product might work for you. But if you have hair like mine, you might want to look somewhere else."
156,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky residue,"I bought the shampoo at Costco hoping it would tame my dry frizzy hair.  Posting here since I read the reviews to see if this is a common problem, and sounds like I'm not alone.  I washed with it the first time, and I thought maybe I forgot to rinse my hair because my hair felt sticky and greasy after it dried.  So I tried again and made sure I rinsed really well.  Same result...so sticky that my fingers get stuck when I try to comb through.  I can't wear a ponytail because my roots look so greasy.  The pump also didn't work. Very disappointed.  Maybe the conditioner is better."
157,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst shampoo ever!,"This shampoo requires a great amount  to get a lather, which is what the directions direct you to do. Unfortunately it left my hair dry and sticky. The second time I tried, I used less. My hair is not as sticky but appears to be supper dry, and it’s difficult to get the comb through. I feel I lose more hair every time I comb it. It is called everyday shampoo because you have to wash your hair everyday because the shampoo makes it feel dirty every day, not because it is okay to use it every day and not damage your hair. If you love the sticky, tangly, dry, dirty feel to your hair, you’ll love this shampoo!"
158,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for me at all,"I have virgin 2C/3A coarse and medium porosity hair that tends to become frizzy a lot. This shampoo and conditioner did nothing for my hair. I had wash it 4 times for the shampoo to somewhat clean my hair. And I still felt a sticky residue after I rinsed it out. The conditioner felt nice but again it was a struggle to rinse out. After I blow dried, my hair felt weighed down, dull and extremely frizzy. I will not be purchasing this product again."
159,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,In love,"I went to the store maybe two weeks ago and bought the shampoo alone. It was pretty expensive but I’m a sucker for coconut shampoo and I wanted to try something new. I really was not expecting such an amazing product. Since the I have gotten the conditioner, the body lotion, the body wash, another lotion, and already have some other products from them in mind. All through out every single one is a winner.The shampoo leaves my hair super soft the point I didn’t even think it needed conditioner. The conditioner leaves it even softer but not greasy. Smells great, affordable, organic, what is not to love?I’m a man, with curly hair, I keep a medium length hair style and also use the shampo & conditioner on my beard."
160,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use this with another stronger shampoo,"More of a tip than a review. I got it from whole foods initially without checking review or anything, and at first I ran into the same problem with a lot of the reviewers here. My hair is slightly oily that gets greasy in a day and a half. This shampoo made my hair go greasy in a day (or less?). So after getting another shampoo that was way stronger and dried my scalp out (fyi it was one of lush shampoo bars, i think they are really strong in general) I decided to put this on after the first wash as it seemed to coat my hair with something, and now my hair goes greasy in two days--way longer than what it used to be if i use any shampoo by itself. My speculation is that there is something about this shampoo that coats your hair rather than degrease it completely (hence ""hydrating""), so you should pair it up with a stronger one if you find this too heavy for your taste. If you do that, this shampoo is really worth it. I change my shampoo almost every bottle but this routine is so golden that I'm not willing to experiment for a while now. And the scent is lovely if you like coconut."
161,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Yuk.,Left my hair tacky and limp.  Also stiff.  Couldn't run my fingers through my hair.  Yuk!!  Had to wash with Suave the next day.
162,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had to use it to shave my legs to at least not have it go to waste…,"I have long medium-thick hair. OMG the struggle to try and wash it all out! YUCK. After hours when my hair was all dry, it left my hair feeling nasty and greasy. It was like I didn’t wash it all out in the shower! Awful shampoo!"
163,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Induced Hair Loss,"I'm not sure why Shea Moisture has this effect on my hair... It makes it soft and hydrated, but causes balding if used for a long period of time (or at least in my case).  My 3b/3a hair falls out with each wash or if detangling when using this product. It doesn't matter what line I use from the brand. I even make sure to use a clarifying shampoo every other week. Shea Moisture is NOT THE ONLY BRAND THAT DOES THIS. I'm sure you've heard Deva Curl? I'm only writing this review because I wanted to share that THE ONLY SHAMPOO that did not cause my to hair fall out while washing was  Innersense Organics. The problem is it's so expensive. But if you look it up on the Think Dirty App, it has the cleanest rating out of all of the curly hair shampoos; And YES  it leaves your hair soft and weightless. The cost and quantities is the only downside."
164,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but not for fine hair,I like this brand because it is all natural and I bought the daily shampoo thinking that it will take back my waves as described by CG gurls that used but it gives me a lot of weight in my hair (fine hair and low porosity) and I do not recommend if you have those characteristics. It left  me a feeling on my hair like I did not wash it out and my scalp started with a very itchy feeling.After using a clarifier my hair is better.Maybe I will try the weightless shampoo from same brand.Hope this helps!
165,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY THIS, by far the worst shampoo I’ve ever used (I’ve used so many different brands I obsess over shampoo) even the hotel shampoo is better than this. This left my hair feeling like I haven’t washed it in 2 months, very dry and sticky. Almost felt like I put Shea butter and left it sitting in for a day or 2! In other words, I was very disappointed!"
166,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves residue/product in your hair,I tried this after using the Orlando Pita argan glass shampoo for years and I immediately hated it. My hair was weighed down with product that did not wash out. I washed with a tea tree shampoo the next day and tried again later on. Still hate it.It makes your hair feel yucky.I have thick  brown wavy hair.
167,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,"WORST SHAMPOO I""VE EVER PURCHASED","DO NOT BUY unless you have extremely curly hair. It says all hair types but that is not the case, and I honestly wouldn't recommend it even for curly hair. No matter how well you rinse it out, it leaves this disgusting feeling film ALL THROUGH your hair. My hair literally feels like I've been stranded out in the wilderness for months after coming out of the SHOWER. It's not hydrating, it's GREASY. The conditioner is fine, nothing special."
168,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,This made my hair look so much healthier!,"After using this for only a month I’ve seen a huge difference! I used to use Head and Shoulders, which damaged my hair a lot. This has added so much moisture to my hair and I don’t exactly love the scent but I don’t mind it. If you’re on the fence, definitely give it a try!"
169,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,softness,"I have been using this shampoo for a couple of years, I rarely use the conditioner because my hair doesn't tangle up with the shampoo.  I like the scent and my hair stays clean for about 3 days. I don't like to shampoo to often because my hair is thining.  After using regular shampoo my scalp starts to itch and with Shea Butter shampoo it doesn't."
170,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"I have fine wavy white hair (I’m in my late 50s) and I endeavor to follow the curly girl method. This shampoo left my hair soft, shiny, bouncy. Yes, I rinsed thoroughly, as you should. No, it’s not going to create billows of suds, but I had plenty of lather. It’s sulfate-free. Use sulfates if you want sudsy, squeaky clean dried out, stripped hair that you don’t  rinse well."
171,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst conditioner ever!,I bought my 100% virgin coconut oil daily hydration conditioner at Costco on sale for $12 & it is the worst conditioner I’ve ever tried.

172,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky and heavy - lifeless and dull,"It won't even make you feel like you washed your hair. Rather than feeling clean and refreshed, your hair will feel lifeless, heavy and oily. To top it off it leaves a sticky residue! I have so many questions about why anyone would love or even like this product."
173,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad product,"DO NOT BUY THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER FROM ANYWHERE. It will dry out, break your hair and make it fall off."
174,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Itchy,This product made me and wifes scalp itchy after use. We expected the opposite effect. Smells like cheap dial bar soap. If I washed my hair with a bar of soap it would probably feel the same. Does not smell like coconut at all. Price was kinda high so I am disappointed. Feeling ripped off!
175,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY,"I really wanted to like this shampoo,BUT it left my hair looking very dry and literally feels stiff as if I put wax on my hair. It doesn't feel soft at all.

Each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does not bother my severe asthma & psoriasis,I have a hard time finding a shampoo and conditioner that I use.  I cannot use scented products with my asthma.  Most products make my head unbearably itchy because of psoriasis.  I tried this product with very little hope of being able to use it because it does have the smell of coconut.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I also like the way it makes my hair feel.  I have limp hair and feel I have more volume with these products.

203,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me,I have dry processed ends but fine hair. After reading the reviews I was really hopeful this would soften up my hair. But the conditioner was very hard to work through and once dried my hair feels like there is a residue.  Feels weighted. Disappointed .
204,SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | 13 fl. oz. Each,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT GET THIS,I used this shampoo and conditioner and it made my hair feel so greasy and waxy and then made my ends so brittle. I thought maybe I didn’t rinse the shampoo out enough but when I used it the next time and rinsed very very thoroughly it ended up the same. My hair dresser  said he needed to wash my hair 3 times after the fact to get out the waxy coating left on my hair. Do not waste ur $$ on this
0,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same product as what you buy in store,"I bought my first bottle of this from my local Walmart and fell in love.  I went back to Walmart buy more, but they were out.  I checked at Target, but they didn’t have it either.  So I tried the next best thing, ordering from Amazon.  The shampoo is AWFUL.  There is no way this is the same shampoo I bought from Walmart.  It makes my hair look so stringy and greasy, that I have to put dry shampoo in my hair to make it look like I actually washed it.  I gave this bottle three tries, and it’s a major fail.  DO NOT BUY!"
1,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY nice.,I use it to clean and moisturize . It helps with the itch from psoriasis.
2,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,"I got turned on to this shampoo through the YouTube channel Curly Penny who I started watching recently. I must say that I love it. A little goes a long way and my hair feels very clean after scrubbing with this. If you use too much...it can be a tad drying. I will continue using until I can find a more ""slippy"" shampoo."
3,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I truly can't find anything I dislike about this shampoo.  I only wish I'd tried it a long time ago.  When I was a teenager,  I didn't think a lot about what was in,  or not in,  my shampoo.  I know better now!  This shampoo smells great.  It has this fresh coconut smell that lasts for days.  Yes,  I was being lazy and didn't wash my hair for four (4) days but,  crazy enough,  my hair still smelled nice and it wasn't as dirty looking as would have if I'd used another shampoo.  Yes,  I was impressed.  This shampoo does come with a conditioner and even a leave-in conditioner.  I thought I'd bought the regular conditioner along with the leave-in but,  I accidentally bought two shampoos instead of one shampoo and one conditioner.  That was okay because I gave my daughter the second shampoo and still had the leave-in conditioner.  What I ended up discovering was that even washing my hair in hard water,  my hair was still silky soft and I didn't need the conditioner.  My long hair,  which tangles easily,  was not as difficult to comb through like it was with previous shampoos I'd used.  And,  no frizz or static electricity that you can often get from not using conditioner.  I live in Arizona and the weather can be drying to your hair if you don't condition it.  I haven't had that problem and my hair feels great.  No doubt it's the 100% virgin coconut oil in it.  What's not in it is sulfates or parabens.  So I know this is a quality shampoo.  This is the only shampoo I'll buy now."
4,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"smells good, good lather, hair feels dry after","it smells good, it has a good lather and feels like my hair is really clean. But it makes my hair dry and squeaky.. maybe a little on the harsh side? Especially compared to other products. This is apparently silicone free, sulfate free, etc and seems good for curly hair but its squeaky clean and hair feels dry. Hair does not feel hydrated or healthy-- but just clean. Everybody's hair is different so it might work for you."

The matching conditioner however is too heavy for my fine hair, so I usually pair it with the Argan Oil conditioner, or use the conditioner version sparingly/occasionally.  I love the shampoo though."

After trying several brands, I gave this shampoo a chance.  I love it.  It cleanses naturally, my hair is smooth and soft, and I complement it with the same brand's finishing oil serum.  My hair is shiny, manageable and soft! Will purchase again."

I can usually wash every 2 days. With this, I washed every day and couldn't get the grease/gunk feeling out of my roots. Like the idea, hate the end result for myself."
39,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,doesnt dry out hair like most shampoos,Very rich and not suitable for daily use. Not as good as my pricier coconut shampoo but cannot complain

This shampoo dried-out my hair, rather than hydrated it. I was very patient and waited for the hydration to be manifested for many weeks, but oddly, my hair became more and more of a straw-type texture.I have given up on this product."

My hair was incredibly damaged. I have straight hair of medium thickness that was abused beyond belief. I had it bleached and dyed blue for months and months, and my hair was literally snapping when touched.I tried all sorts. Expensive masks. Cheaper ones. Homemade ones. Nourishing shampoos, not shampooing... Everything. My hair still looked like crap.A few months after using this shampoo and my hair is completely different. I only use it three times a week and I have no need to condition afterwards. My hair is soft and shiny and I love love this shampoo."
60,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"It does the job,but not much else. It is definitely a lot better than other drugstore sulfate free shampoos. It doesn't lather too much,and it doesn't dry out my scalp at all. It also gets rid of dry flakes pretty well.However,it doesn't smell very good. Actually,it doesnt smell like anything at all! I was surprised,but i guess it's better that way.I feel like is quite expensive in the UK,so i would recommand if you're looking for a relatively consistent shampoo for curly hair. You're better off getting cheaper otherwise."
61,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I ordered this because i already had a conditioner which was perfect and why i went for the shampoo. When shampoo arrived and i opened it first thing i noticed it didn't smell the same. Had no scent at all but soapy smell.Also came damaged so i was already missing 2cm if shampoo in my bottle. The seal was stuck to the top. I will not bother with this brand anymore at all. I still tried it out.. but once i dried my hair. My hair felt like it was soaked in wax. I had to rewash my hair with different shampoo. Very dissapointed
62,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,Verified Purchase,Report abuse,It's hard to find a curly hair friendly shampoo but this is it sis.  Very little becomes very sudsy so you can clean more hair with less product. The smell is out of this world! And the hair is left clean and ready for your hair masque. Can be drying so DO NOT use this more than twice a week.

65,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"My hair was really soft prior to using this shampoo. Considering it's marketed as a 'hydrating' shampoo, I found that it really dried out my fine hair. Even with conditioner, once it's dry I have to comb argan oil through otherwise it feels brittle and tangly. I researched to see which shea moisture shampoo was suitable for my hair type (low porosity, fine, straight) and this was the one recommended- Pretty disappointed!"

74,Sheamoisture Daily Hydration Shampoo for All Hair Types 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz,Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Es el primer champú sin sulfatos y siliconas que utilizo y la verdad que estoy encantada. Estos champús según tengo entendido suelen hacer muy poca espuma (debido a sus ingredientes) y dejar el pelo seco, pero este en concreto no.Hace la espuma suficiente como para saber si has lavado bien o no el pelo. Además he de añadir que en mi caso no me ha resecado el pelo en absoluto, ¡lo noto muy sano!, estaba teniendo problemas horrososos con la escamación, pero desde el primer lavado he notado una diferencia brutal, a los 3 días usándolo ya no tenía nada.Sin duda lo recomiendo 100%, aunque si no estás dispuesto a darle el tiempo necesario de adaptación quizá no sea el más indicado para ti.Pd. ¡Ojo, que si utilizas el champú sin sulfatos, etc. y a continuación (o antes) usas otros productos (mascarillas, acondicionadores, etc.) que sí los llevan no te va a ser de mucho!"

Mais en effet, après ma première utilisation, un film gras désagréable était sur tous mes cheveux. Par contre, le point positif côté visuel : les cheveux n'ont pas l'air gras mais plutôt brillant et soyeux. Je lui ai laissé sa chance au produit pendants 3 lavages mais je ne peux plus supporter le toucher de mes cheveux. Je ne vais quand même pas jeter ce shampoing, je vais voir si je peux faire des mélanges pour atténuer un peu l'effet."

Limpia muy bien y en conjunto con un acondicionador deja el pelo bastante bien. Es un producto caro pero como en el mercado español es difícil encontrar marcas sin parabenos, siliconas y sobre todo, sulfatos, esta es muy buena opción."

0,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for thin-ish curly hair,"Only discovered Shea Moisture a year ago, but just LOVE this leave-in conditioner.  I spritz it on after toweling my hair off, and voila - no tangles!  And with thin-ish naturally curly hair, it does NOT weigh it down.  On my 2nd bottle already.  Also, I use on dry hair and then ""scrunch"" for more defined curls.  love this stuff!"
1,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my go-to CG products.,"Part of my daily routine for sulfate, silicon, and paraben free curls. I've been using Shea Moisture products for about a year and a half, now, and every one of them has been a hit in different ways. This leave-in has great nourishment and good slip, and substantially reduces frizz. It's also lightweight enough that there's really no such thing as too much AS LONG AS YOU APPLY IT TO WET HAIR. I'd say this is probably a great base for any curl routine, but I can only speak from experience that it works wonders for my 3A/3B curl pattern."
2,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Little goes a very long way!,"My cousin introduced me to this product.  I have naturally curly hair and now in my 50's I have found a product that works very well.  You do NOT need to use much.  Just put a very small amount in your palms, rub together and scrunch up on the curls.  I do not put it on my roots.  A little goes a very long way.  I will def be purchasing this product ONLY for my hair going forward.  Thank you for coming up with a product that isn't stiff, smelly, or heavy!"
3,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful Smell and Works Amazingly!,"Amazing!! This stuff does all that it says it will do! My thin hair feels soft, light, and isn’t weighed down at all by this product.  Another plus is the smell.  It’s not too strong but the coconut scent is definitely there.  I’ve noticed when I’m in a pool or if I get my hair wet again, the smell seems to come off lightly if I have used it earlier in the day, which I like.Also, I have sensitive skin and some hair products will cause me to breakout on my back where my hair touches or around my face.  I have been using this for a couple weeks now and there have been no breakouts in those areas!"
4,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good leave in product for my thin curly/wavy hair.,"I use this when my hair is damp, and it seems to hold my curls together without any other products.  My hair is thin and when I put it on my hair from about 4 inches from my scalp on down, it works well.  If I get it on  or near my scalp, it looks greasy and my hair is weighed down, which is probably just MY hair.  I'll be reordering!"

This is my daily go to refresher spray. I'm on my 3rd full size bottle and it smells amazing and leaves my hair extremely moisturized.  Prior to using this product,  I had a lot of breakage and shedding.  This reduced it by at least 75%. Great product,  please don't change the ingredients."
9,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lovely Smell, Soft Strands Without Silicone","When used right, it's great. Hair is soft and smells really nice, like coconut AND flowers. May purchase again, but I like this brand, so I might play with their other leave-ins before I settle on one I like.It MUST be used while all of the hair is still at least quite damp. I have long, porous hair, with ends that dry much faster than the rest of my hair, and at first I waited until most of my hair was damp, which meant my ends were already dry and the product sat heavily on top of the area that needed it to sink in the most. I know many people with long hair have this multiple-porisity issue, so if you do, use the product while the ends are damp and the rest of your hair is a little more wet."
10,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very hydrating, light, perfect for fine curls","I've been looking for a great leave in conditioner with natural ingredients and Shea Moisture came thru!!! I'm Latina and white with fine but very dense 3a-b hair. This stuff is lightweight and very hydrating, and although the bottle is small and I used it liberally it actually lasts a long time. This stuff is very milky and not exactly thick or creamy. It won't weigh your hair down but provides moisture and a good base for your other products. This line is great for hair that is dry, fine, or prone to buildup. Would buy again."
11,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Funky smell is NOT coconut, too much weight in my hair","I am in the beginning of my CGM journey with 2c/3a hair and saw all the great reviews. The scent was nasty- like stale musty funk. I added some coconut essential oil and drops of vanilla and that made it somewhat more palatable.But the conditioner weighed down my hair, didn't help with frizz and was too heavy of a moisturizer for my curls."
12,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Love this Product,I discovered the leave-in conditioner spray and the gel styler at CVS last summer while waiting in the checkout line - I bought the travel size bottles and fell in love but never got around to buying the full size until a week ago. I love the leave-in conditioner because I can spritz my hair and twist at night before bed. It keeps my hair moisturized and soft which works for me right now!

15,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy.,"This product is not at all what I thought it would be. Immediately after using, my hair felt extremely dry and brittle. I can hardly run my fingers through it without it feeling like it’s going to break off. Mind you, this is right after washing and combing so my hair was 100% tangle free... until I used this. My ends don’t feel moisturized whatsoever. I’ve used it twice now, in hopes it would be better the second time around but I was so wrong. I also can’t help but notice how watered down it seems. Maybe it’s a knock off, I don’t know. I wouldn’t bother buying this product though. In my opinion, it’s not worth the money. I would return it but it’s just not even worth the hassle. Overall, save your money and find something else:"

It's light and that's something I was looking for, for me and my daughter. I don't want something I feel like it heavy product and I have to wash it out of my hair every night. The smell is pleasant and it's perfect for the both of us as a base to our hair care routine."

148,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonders for frizzy curly hair,"I have tried so many products to keep my hair from being frizzy and to keep my curls all day.  I finally found this stuff, and it is so light, detangles, and makes my long hair soft, and keeps curls.  Other products often either leave my curls hard and crunchy or wet looking or is too heavy.  I absolutely love this stuff.  I gave it 5 stars because of the product itself.  However, I have to say I wish there was another way to get the product onto my hair.  The spray bottle is difficult to keep pumping over and over (for my long hair).  I have tried taking the pump off and putting it into my palm to rub it in, but this product is thin and liquid to go through the pump it's hard to do it that way.  Hoping they have a product that is a little thicker to apply easier."

Sprayed my hair lightly the evening I bought it, but couldn't go so sleep with this scent on my hair as it provoked a headache. Awful, awful smell and so artificial. Not at all like a lovely coconut scent. So disappointed and returning today."

When I began unpacking my items, out of curiosity (I had my suspicions), I opened it up and the smell was lovely, I sprayed a small amount into my hair and immediately my hair became very soft an manageable. Then I tried it in a couple of my grandsons hair and it easily loosened up that thick tough to get through tangle. So I recently ordered a couple more on amazon because I know that I will need extra for the household, then I can keep mine away from everyone else."

I bought this because the ingredients are safe.  But I have baby fine thin blonde hair and this made my hair feel like straw.  It smells good but makes my hair tangled and gross.  It weighs my fine hair down.  I hope I can find a non toxic leave in product  that works for my hair type, but this is not it."

Other than that it will ruin your hair. My daughter followed the directions and did as she was supposed to and we almost had to cut half of her hair off. We were going to have to cut it above her shoulders and her hair reaches to the middle of her back. It makes your hair greasy. I would definitely NOT recommend this, if you want to keep your hair nice and long. I'm going to return this terrible product. And when it got delivered and we took it out of the box it wasn't even packaged and it wasn't closed properly, so it started leaking."

So fantastic.The smell is incredible and perfect for anyone with natural curls or waves.Even though my hair is curly, the texture is baby fine.  I don't need much of this product.If you have limp hair, I recommend something lighter.This works best on thick heads of curls."

Even just a little makes my freshly washed hair look like second or third day hair. And it is still not frizz free. Strange.It wasn’t until I learned that I have low porosity hair that it made sense to me (being oil spray & all). I imagine there are other folks like me out there who are just learning all the ins & outs of this stuff, and who could also be misled by the all hair types label.I so wanted to like this because most detangling sprays have terrible ingredients! :-( But the search continues)."

I was excited when she said she got this at the local grocery store.Sadly, this product was disappointing.  Despite its boast that it has frizz control, my hair remained frizzy.  Other (cheaper) products have no problem controlling my frizz.Also, while there is a coconut scent, there is also a heavy perfume scent overlaying it  Some people like perfume smells - I do not, would prefer coconut."

I have 3C hair and it doesn't weigh. The only thing about this spritz is that I loathe the spritz part. It's hard to spritz with one finger when it gets all slippery. I like to grip. So I'll have to place the liquid in a spray bottle.

Lightly mist before combing that tangly mess, and if you get a knot in your hair after washing plaster it with this stuff and work with your fingers to try to untangle the knot, you just might rescue the whole clump of hair...  very gently use your comb at the bottom end of your hair below the knot to try to keep straightening out the knot while working with your fingers and spray try to separate the knotted hair... I have had excellent results with my tangly hair, and if you end up spraying too much in your hair it can get noticeable but if it saves you from ripping your hair out, I say its worth it!  On the other days when I don't get a knot or tangle, I just lightly mist it on the ends to keep them in control and you don't notice it at all... the scent stays lovely all day... and it doesn't way your hair down when used lightly.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  This is SILICONE-FREE  Thank goodness because I break out and have rashes with all those silicone products out there."

It looked so unhealthy after spraying on wet hair. The aerosol is too fine and gets in your nose everytime, and the smell is way too strong. I love other Shea Moisture products but cannot recommend this one."

My hair absolutely LOVES this stuff, it makes it a lot more plush and moisture-retaining. and as the week goes by, when my hair starts to dry out and get ""crispy,"" i just do a little spritz around my hair, and it makes it just as soft as day 1.Definitely would recommend, and this bottle looks like itll last a long time."

235,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I’m really on the fence ! I bought this at sported it was up on the vogue beauty awards this year ... although it’s all natural something feels like it’s actaully drying out my hair ! It moisturisers initially (though does give a slight oily look - I now use less as like it to look natural) and then my hair seems even dryer ! I have fine curly brown hair but LOTS of it and it’s really long ! It could perhaps be the change of weather ? But I’m really not convinced! I will stay with it ... have read SO many good reviews !

238,"Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Leave-in Treatment, Shine Curly and Tame Frizz for Tangle-Free Hair, All Natural certified Organic, 8 Ounce",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Lo compre pensando en que la composición siendo de shea moisture sería muy buena. Sorpresa tiene componentes perfumantes y de riesgo limitado y medio para el cuero cabelludo que pueden producir hasta dermatitis no se porque shea moisture con lo caro que es promociona unos productos libres si uno sigue el método curly y entiende te das cuenta cuando lees los ingredientes así que da lo mismo lo que promocione no lo son por lo menos este. Cómo sigo el método curly lo gastaré pero no me hace gracia confiar en una marca y que sea cara y que tenga problemas.

Sono mulata. I miei capelli sono rovinati a causa dei vari trattamenti fatti negli anni. Attualmente sono in transizione (meta con relaxer e l'altra no). Si rompono e sembra che non crescano mai. Sono secchi con doppie punte. Devo lavarli ogni 3/4 giorni altrimenti inizio ad avere prurito e un po' di forfora. Questo prodotto credo non vada bene per me. Lho usato su capelli bagnati, asciutti, pre styling ma nessun beneficio. Anzì, devo dire che se usavo troppo prodotto, vedevo i capelli opachi dopo. Non mi sono trovata bene."

It was also not filled to the common amount of liquid that it should be filled with. Below the tape there were dirt and hair!!! The product itself smells like cheap conditioner with a hint of coconut. It also feels very drying. I’m not sure if it’s even genuine?
