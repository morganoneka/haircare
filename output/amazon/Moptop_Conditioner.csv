0,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",1.0 out of 5 stars,Caution!,"Let me start by saying I love this product. However, it has no preservatives in it and can actually “go bad” if it sits to long. I usually get it from my hair salon, but found it here on amazon and decided to order it. When it arrived, the tubs were wrapped in additional plastic (which is different from the salon) and the safety seal was missing. The thing that bothered me though was the color, consistency and smell of the product. It is supposed to smell wonderful (somewhat sweet but not overpowering) with a light opal color the consistency of thick honey. This was fowl smelling, runny and darker than it was supposed to be. Long story long, great product but buy it at a store so you can check it’s color!"
1,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Staple product, consistent results.","This is one of my staple products. I have 2B, low porosity, fine-medium strands, high density hair. This custard smells great and is very concentrated, ensure you emulsify well when applying.  Custards don’t typically provide a lot of hold but I do think this product has a good amount of hold on its own. I typically use it on wash days but have used it to refresh and it will revive and hold my waves. Product smells great, citrusy like a Kumquat but the smell unfortunately will not linger (I personally would love to smell like this product all day long). The product does contain protein and glycerin. It has held up well even in humidity despite the glycerin content. This is likely because I DO layer this product with 2 other stylers that I think are a great combination and compliment each other superbly. I use the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curl Magic as a base, Moptop Curl Custard second, and seal the deal with Jessie Curl Spiralicious. In the pictures my hair looks wet/shiny, but it is fully dry FYI.In case you are wondering I use a cowash, As I Am 2 out of my 3 weekly wash days and clarify with Bounce Curl Clarifying Shampoo, and condition with Bounce Curl Super Smooth conditioner.I went crazy buying a bunch of products when I transitioned to embracing my natural hair, but hands down this product with the combination I mentioned above is a definite winner for my hair type. As you can see, I was so confident in my line-up that I went out to my first dressy outing sporting my natural hair for the first time since my transition and I was not disappointed. It gave me such confidence to know you can look “put together” with wavy/textured hair."
2,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,great custard,"This is indeed a great custard, better than the other super famous custard, Kinky Curly. With moptop hair dries faster, I get better definition and glossy clumps. My hair is 2c, fine but dense, dry, heavily highlighted. I really get beautiful results. It is pretty forgiving, as if you use too much, you can easily scrunch out the cast and it won't weight your hair down a bit...this is another big difference with kinky curly...with my hair type it is pretty much impossible to get volume with kinky curly custard, but I get ton of body with lots of movement with moptop custard. The only con is the high content of glycerin that causes frizz in the super humid, high dew points days we have here in Florida. In those days, I can't usually use moptop by itself as a solo styler, but I need to top it with a hard hold-no/low glycerin gel (great with AG liquid effects, or Biosilk hard rock gelee). Not a big deal, I still get the good definition and bounciness moptop gives."

I don’t know how I have gone all this time without knowing about this product.

4,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",1.0 out of 5 stars,False Advertising,"I recently ordered MopTop leave-in conditioner and was very disappointed in their advertising. On the description of the product it said that this hair product was paraben-free. sulfate-free, and many other things free. I was very disappointed when I read the ingredients of the product and found out that there is sulfate in the conditioner. I purchased this item because it said it was all natural and free from any chemicals. Very, Very disappointed."
5,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great healthy gel alternative,"This custard is more like a light hold gel for wash and go days. I have wavy frizzy hair and this left my hair with almost totally frizz free, soft, bouncy curls. It definitely has a funky slimy texture with a strong fruity citrus smell but the smell dissipates as it dries.Pros:Adds shineSoft not crunchy curlsLightweightNatural ingredientsAffordableCons:Tames most frizz but not allOverall I am pleased to have this on hand. It is a much better alternative to the unhealthy ingredients I got from my previous gel. Still looking for something natural to completely tame my frizz without looking like a grease ball.UPDATE: After a few months of use I found that if I use a little more on top where I'm most prone to get frizz it will make a slight cast that I can break after it dries and then I'm frizz free! I just pull the locks through my fingers to unstiffen it until it looks natural.I'm also so impressed with how much volume I get with this. It doesn't weigh down my hair even though I add extra on top. Updating my rating to 5 stars. I use it daily after showering or to refresh curls. I still have plenty left. I'd guess with my medium length hair it will last at least 6 months. Great natural product and value!"

8,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",3.0 out of 5 stars,Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-aloe,"I wanted to love this gel, I really did, but it's just not for me. It smells amazing and it has this really interesting thin consistency that seems perfect for not weighing down my curls.And yet, here I am, the fourth wash day using this product, and I have conceded defeat. I kept getting fuzzy, frizzy, stringy, undefined curls and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Turns out, aloe is a problem for a lot of curlies. If your hair is instantly frizzing and losing it's ""clumpage"" when you add this gel, consider that your hair might not like aloe. Look up flash-drying.I don't want to give this product a bad rating just because I didn't know aloe wouldn't work with my hair. After all, it seems to work well for lots of people! I just hope this review helps someone else who is struggling with this gel and can't figure out why."

   This stuff is my new go-to! Wish i found it sooner.I’ve never been quite sure what the difference between gel and custard/jelly is — there are so many different types of products out there! But in my experience I’ve found custards and jellys to clump my hair nicely but not necessarily define them, and I’ve found them to leave my hair looking a little greasy and leaving a weird residue on them, whereas I’ve found gels to define and hold hair much better, but often leave it crunchy with lots of flyaways. Also, gels hold seems to be too strong and leaves a lot of my waves/curls misshapen. This product has a unique texture, not 100% like either gel or jelly (see video)My hair ranges from ‘s’ wave patterns to curls (mostly underneath.) The top is prone to extreme frizziness and just general “poof” and the front pieces that frame my face are prone to losing all wave pattern. This product seems to address all my hair concerns: manages frizz, boosts curl patterns where it’s needed, and holds pretty well without leaving a weird greasy residue.Overall I’d say this product is the perfect medium between jelly and gel! More hold than a jelly but less crunch than a gel. It smells great too and i like that it comes in a jar. I use a leave in conditioner/curl cream first and then use this product to scrunch my hair, let it dry, and I’m good to go.Hope this product helps someone struggling with their hair as much as it helped me! For the price you can’t go wrong giving it a chance— I’m so glad i did :)"
10,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes! Great for curly, frizzy, wavy hair in any humidity","This stuff is great! It smells slightly citrusy but not sweet, a little like baby aspirin, lol, but the smell is nice and is not strong. The texture is hard to describe - it is thick and maybe best described like ""slime"" but not slimy. It is thick and luxurious. You will only need a little to apply to your hair; I have long, thick hair, and I use about two quarter size blobs. Run through wet or damp hair and comb through, fluff your curls and then leave your hair alone. You will find that your curls are well defined, moist, and not frizzy at all. The product can be a little stiff, but if you shake your hair out, the stiffness goes away. There is absolutely no flaking at all with this product. I am also allergic to a lot of gels and mousses (the perfumes cause scalp problems), but I have no problems with this product at all. I'm picky with hair products, and I've tried a million of them. I will buy this one again!"
11,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Changing Shampoo!!,"This is the second or third sulfate-free shampoo that I've ever tried and I love it! I have wavy 2b hair, and ever since using this product I've noticed such a change in its texture and shine. I can go longer between wash days, which in turn means my hair is looking a lot healthier and shinier. My main concern when first buying this was that it wouldn't lather as well or that my hair wouldn't be as clean and I am so happy I was wrong. The lather is a little less voluminous than your standard bottle of shampoo but it will still keep your hair very clean without making it feel like straw. Aside from all of this, a major highlight of this shampoo is the bamboo scent. I have been asked by three to four people about this shampoo because of the smell alone.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger size ( please make a 16 oz. version!!). Highly recommend!"
12,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,Suitable for fine hair,"I have fine, wavy hair and most leave in conditioners don't work for me. Liquids are too light and don't offer enough slip, and creams are too heavy and leave my waves/curls weighed down. This one is just right! It looks like a thick cream but it goes on very light. I apply it from my ears down and it leaves me with bouncy, moist curls. I adore the bamboo essence scent, which is very light and fresh with a slight citrus smell to it."
13,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely LOVE this product,"I absolutely LOVE this product!!!  I use this over the Shea Moisture Miracle Leave In Styler and I get the most beautiful results.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny and does really well in humid weather.  And you cant beat the price.  I was using DevaCurls Ultra Defining gel for a while but that would leave my hair looking extra dry on day 2 and 3 hair.  With the MopTop my hair looks and feels great for days without needing much refreshing."

Can't use it in high humidity nor in really low humidity so it is really limited to early Spring and maybe fall, or at least it is here in the South. It is sitting in the back of my cabinet waiting on dew points to get into the correct range. Would rather buy something that can be used year round!"
15,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,It's great stuff,"I've tried several things over the years, from the store and salon, and I kept going back to $3 Garnier Curl Construct mousse to hold my curl pattern.  Along with Curly Girl advice, I have kept my thinning strands from frizzing (thanks Mother Nature) using that mousse and conditioning with every wash.  But I was curious to try a curly hair custard and, on a whim, bought this.  I am so glad I did. This holds my large spiral pattern as well as my old mousse, but my hair looks fuller, feels bouncier and softer.  Like there's nothing weighing it down. And on day 2, I can spritz my hair with water, scrunch, and it perks right up again.  Trying that with the Garnier left my hair looking a little flat and dirty.A small amount does the trick on my shoulder length bob, applied by scrunching it thru fairly wet strands and then carefully drying with a diffuser.  The citrus scent is nice.  The price no longer bothers me because that container is going to last me awhile and the results can't be beat.  Highly recommend!"

I had previously ordered a sample packet from moptop directly and LOVED the conditioner. I ordered through amazon because I had a credit on my account. The product I received was packaged well and sealed, but the conditioner does NOT perform anything close to the sample. The real conditioner detangles my hair and has a great slip to it, what I received doesn’t help detangle at all. Super disappointed."

It lathers up quite a bit!  I use it several times a week. I follow the curly girl method but  I found that co-washing is just way too much oil for my fine 2B waves so I use this shampoo (and moptop's light conditioner).  I prefer this for my daughters fine, straight hair too. I used this and the light conditioner on it and her hair is the best it's ever been..everything at the store is too heavy or left her hair staticky.  this is the perfect combo"

This custard is the perfect addition to using the daily gel!  It's gives your hair even more bounce and curl.  I love love love the custard.  All of the MopTop products make my curls so much better than they were before MopTop!  I have tried so many different products and can honestly say MopTop is THE BEST!
19,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,Your hair style will last for days!,"I am loving Mop Top!I’ve religiously used LUS for at least the past year and a half and loved it. But my curls just aren’t as full and I would have to completely re-do my hair daily if I didn’t want to just shove it in a bun. You know what I mean- totally wet it, work in fresh product, diffuse.....I have enough hair that that gets annoying.BUT with Mop Top I get out of the shower on day one and split my wet hair down the middle, over my shoulders, take a very small scoop of the goo and twist and finger brush it through each section. Then I flip my head, scrunch my hair and diffuse.I have noticed that a tiny bit of product goes a long way and it can get crunchy, but I solve that by just rolling my curls between my hands in sections to loosen the crunch and it’s perfect!Then, my favorite part about this product:I don’t wash my hair every day when I shower. I may go 3-4 days no wash. But like I said with my previous product: I would have to re-do the entire curly process if I wanted my hair done daily. NOT with Mop Top. A few sprays with a water bottle to reform the bed head (not even enough worth diffuse drying) and boom! My hair looks like day one! For all three days! No extra product! I love it!This tub of goo will last forever!The photo I’m posting is day THREE!"
20,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite sulfate free shampoo,"I've tried lots of sulfate free shampoos and this one is hands-down my favorite for my fine, wavy hair. It foams up great and the bamboo essence scent is divine (it's a fresh, light scent with a hint of citrus). It cleans thoroughly, but like all sulfate free shampoos, there are some tricks to helping it clean properly. You must use LOTS of water...add more water, not more product, if you feel like you need more cleaning power. Also, let it sit just a bit longer than regular shampoo. After that it will leave your hair squeaky clean, with no scalp irritation from harsh sulfates. It does not dry my hair out."
21,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",4.0 out of 5 stars,Glycerin!!,This would be a great product if it didn't have glycerin. That one ingredient limits it's usefulness for those of us that live in humid climates. Talking about frizz!! Companies really need to find a different humectant that is good for humidity. This product is a little pricey to have to put back in the cabinet to wait for the dew points to get into the right range to be able to use. Live and learn.

I have tried so many products so when I came across this stuff I was like Yes! I need to try it. Well the first time I applied it I didn't seem to put enough in my hair (it doesn't state how much to put in your hair so it's trial and error I guess). Before I used it the next time I searched You Tube I found the creators page and watched how she applied it. Well she put on tons it seemed. My hair is about 3 inches shorter and so I tried to adjust the amount. My hair came out crunchy and nothing like hers. Then later that night my hair looked like I had dandruff and my head itched the rest of the night. I should have washed my hair that night because my scalp itched all night. I got up first thing and washed my hair really good but it still itched. I don't think I'll try it again for that reason. I can't stand my scalp itching!

I've been doing the Curly Girl Method since May '18, and have used a lot of different products...but i haven't come across any better gel than this. I have 2c/3a/3b waves/curls, and this stuff helps define everything. Very strong hold (I need that for my hair) but once I ""scrunch out the crunch"" it leaves very soft hair.I wash my hair with Not Your Mother's curl defining shampoo and conditioner (pink bottles) and style with very wet hair. I take sections of my hair and mix together a cream and Jessicurl Spiralicious, apply to hair, and then I apply Mop Top. I brush each section with a Denman brush and smooth each section to encourage clumping. Then I scrunch the hell out of it and fix the wonky curls. I do that to every section and then diffuse until about 80% dry, and let air dry the rest of the way. I've used the rest of my products with a different gel, and definitely love the MopTop results better every time."

The mongongo oil is useless and the custard is hideous.  The custard leaves hair crispy and nasty.  Don’t waste your moneySo here’s what works for my hair:  Mop Top shampoo and conditioner with Ouidad Vitacurl gel.

It’s perfect for detangling wavy and curly hair. However, as someone with thick, long hair, I can’t use this any longer. The bottle is tiny and it equates to about 5-7 washes for $13.

Never used a ""custard"" before, but it does great!!","It is really hard to get my hair products just right for me, but this works great!!!  I started doing my hair with the curly girl method about three months ago, and it was doing better. I just couldn't find the right styling product that didn't have silicone and sulfate in it.  I was recommended to try this, but I couldn't find it in the local stores.  I purchased on Amazon, and it does work for my hair.  Makes it more curly and not all frizzy.  I don't have to use that much either, so this will last a good amount of time.  I do only wash twice a week though.  I just wish this wasn't so expensive, but I am willing to pay this being as it is so hard for me to find the right styling products for my hair!!UPDATE:  This worked great in the winter months but not doing all that good in the summer being as it has glycerin in this.

That is when I discovered that I have low porosity hair, and that the Deva curl gel is full of protein, which is not good for low porosity hair So, I went looking for something with minimal protein and found the Mop Top curly hair custard. I wasn't expecting much, because there are no curl holding chemicals in this gel, but I was very surprised to see that my hair was both fluffy and curly after just one little scoop (3 fingers) of gel. With Mop Top, less is more, so you don't need much. To refresh second day curls, just put a dash of gel and leave in conditioner in a small spray bottle with water. Spray and scrunch, and your curls will hold another day or two, even on fine hair. What I like the most is that this product never weighs down your hair. And it smells citrusy, which I like a lot."

Then I tried a MopTop sample kit and loved this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has the perfect consistency - not too thick but not too watery. For a low-poo it sudses up amazingly, and is easy to scrub into my scalp. I can tell it doesn't cleanse my scalp as well as my clarifying shampoo, but that is to be expected. I will use it 3 out of 4 washes to encourage the natural oils in my hair. It has a great balance of protein vs. moisture. And best of all is the scent - I didn't know bamboo could smell so good! It is an addicting sweet/fresh scent that makes me really look forward to wash days. Which says a lot, as I am usually very sensitive to fragrances and there are many hair products I have to toss because the scents really bother me. I'm loving my journey with MopTop!"

In the course of integrating the Curly Girl method/products, this stuck out as one that helped other low-porosity people. I didn't notice a difference at first, but now that I've experimented with a lot of different products, this one is still part of my wash day routine. I add this right after leave-in and just before I apply a hard cast gel; I can literally feel it sucking the water into the core of my strands, and it takes my hair from dripping to just saturated with one application. Once all three products are applied, I throw my hair up into a microfiber turban until I can diffuse (for anyone that was curious about my post-wash routine). Hope this helps other low-porosity curlies out there!"

Deva is great, but it's really expensive, plus you should change up your product occasionally to give your hair a rest.I shopped around, checked reviews, even tried some samples of a few brands, and MopTop products won the race by a mile! I'm currently using the no-poo cleansing conditioner, the daily conditioner, the leave-in conditioner, and the Curly Hair Custard. The custard was my first purchase and came with some samples from the rest of the line.I will say it works much better with a little extra moisture underneath. After conditioning (or cleansing and conditioning if it's ""wash"" day) I apply a tiny bit of the leave-in while still in the shower with SOAKING wet hair. Then I step out and apply a liberal amount of the Curly Custard, being sure to flip upside-down and side-to-side. Then scrunch scrunch scrunch. I let it air dry then loosen the cast once it's completely dry. This can also be done with a diffuser, but I don't have time for blow dryers. I find I see a lot more frizz if I skip the leave-in."

Didn't provide any better results than lesser expensive products I can buy at my local retail outlet. I bought this because it is natural and minus the sulfates, which can dry out and damage hair and scalp. My scalp has been dry for some time and I have psoriasis, which does flare up from time to time., especially when my scalp is dry. I also changed shampoos at the same time, using a cleansing conditoner free of sulfates.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't really made a difference. Additonally, it tends to create a slightly crispy texture in my hair.  This will probably not be the experience for most people as I have very, very kinky, frizzy curly hair. Although each folicle is very fine, I have a lot of it, and WITH the extreme curl, it often feels almost coarse.I am Scotch Irish and just have crazier hair than most people here buying this product. However, if you share my genetic predisposition, please understand that this may not work for you either.That all being said, the product came well packaged and smells really nice. And I do like that it is natural. *sigh*"

Research suggested that hair similar to mine benefits most from lightweight, moisturizing products. I ended up focusing more on using a lower number of moisturizing products instead of multiple lightweight products. I've used As I Am Leave In Conditioner for my dry hair since before I started this hair journey but decided to ditch it if I'm going to add on a curl activator/enhancer/gel. I tried Cantu Curl Activator, which did almost nothing to define my waves and made my hair more frizzy. I tried Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie which did help enhance my waves (not in the back though), provided decent moisture, reduced some frizz, but did not have much hold- next day waves were basically not a thing and frizz was back. Adding in Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel gave me almost no hold (Upon purchasing I didn't realize it was a light hold gel) and was very drying so I ditched that quickly and replaced it with Eco Style Gel (strong hold gel). It did help with definition and hold all around, not drying, but it wasn't optimal. I moved on to Aunt Jackie's Defining Curl Custard and no gel which impressed me with the moisture, decent hold, reduced frizz, and enhanced definition even in the 2A back of my hair- but it contains silicones that I knew would eventually weigh down my hair. Mop Top Curly Hair Custard Gel had been on my list of CGM approved products to try and I should've gone with it ages ago because this product goes beyond Aunt Jackie's. I have defined waves all around, equal hold, and it is moisturizing. I've gotten the best defined next day waves compared to all other products I've tried. With other/no products, my halo frizz is usually worse the second and third day- but even with humectants being predominant in this product, I have had no halo frizz. I usually get frizz in both dry and humid environments, I have not yet had a chance to test it on a sufficiently humid day. I am optimistic though."

Finally a good hair curl product!!!,"When I was younger I had super straight hair.  Seriously!  Sometimes I had to perm it twice (it was the 80's when spiral perms were ""in"") just to get the curls to stick.  Over the years my hair has evolved and it has slowly developed major frizz.  However, recently I've discovered that when tamed, that frizz is actually waves/curls!  I've purchased some creams and mousses recently to make the most out of my curls, but all of the products I've tried have always resulted in tacky-to-the-touch, frizzy and crunchy stiff hair.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos and some of the ladies raved about this product and their curls did look lovely so I thought I'd by a jar and give it a try.  My jar arrived today and tonight I tried it.  It's AMAZING!!!  I towel dried my hair and applied this product to my damp hair.  This ""custard"" is runny but a little goes a long way so it didn't take much to cover my thin/fine hair.  I loved that it wasn't tacky and cause my hair to stick to my hand when I applied it.  I let my hair air-dry and I was happy to see that every time I checked on it, my curls were curling and there wasn't any frizz in sight!  When my hair was about  75% dry, I decided to defuse it and really give it the frizz test.  Once again... no frizz and my curls were even more prominent!  I've been disappointed by so many products over the years so I am so incredibly happy to find a hair product that surpassed my expectations!  I'm new to MopTop hair products but I'll definitely be giving other MopTop products a try in the future.I highly recommend this product."

I used this after using shampoo and conditioner and it was NOT thick enough nor did I feel like it penetrated the hair shaft. I tend to look the other way when I see a product that claims to work on ALL hair types including fine hair... I am a women of color and my hair is FAR from fine. Save your money if you have kinky coarse textured hair as this will not be enough for you. If you have fine hair and are type 3 and above will probably work great for you.

But the humidity is now at a point here in Georgia that I can’t wear it straight even with anti-humidity hairspray. Some aspects that I was dreading was my hair not drying for six hours and significant gel residue on the nape of my neck and on my chest that is even hard to get off with wet towel.  Thankfully Kinky Curly was out of stock. I washed my hair and applied Moptop and went outside in the hot sun and did yardwork. Sweating profusely. Most of my hair dried though! I pulled and stretched out the curls and still have good definition. Going out for a walk with temp still 86f. Will see how good of a hold I keep. That is always a challenge for me though. End of day my curls have lost a lot of definition. I have super fine non porous bi racial hair and have to scrunch my hair to get curls and use tangle teaser too, to help bring out my curls.

Plopped my hair up in terry turban, while completing other tasks worth about 5-7 minutes. Removed towel and clipped roots up.  Once dry enough, removed clips.  My hair looked so good all work day.

The barcode/info sticker looked like it had gotten wet at some point. However the contents of the container appear to be in good condition.Performance: nice texture to the gel, applies easily, smells good, dries relatively quickly. Decent amount of hold but more difficult to completely break the cast than Kinky Curly custard. Does have a lot of glycerin in it so it is not good in the summer humidity. My normally minimally frizzy 2b wavy hair looked poodle-esk after only a few minutes out air conditioning. I also had some white flaking as it apparently interacts with Miss Jessie’s  curl cream.Overall it’s an okay purchase if it’s not humid outside and I’m in a hurry to leave the house with dry hair.

The smell is not my favorite but does disappear once it dries. Will continue to purchase!"

Please Read,"I tried to give this product the benefit of the doubt. I even tried it for a full 3 months. However, the smell and quality is absolutely horrendous. If you like smelling like candied coconut mixed with playdough...you'll love this scent! I had to spray hairspray or perfume on my head anytime I conditioned with this. Not only that, it left the most residue and buildup in my hair I've ever had. Let me remind you, I used this for 3 months, not changing any other products and this conditioner made my hair greasy, stringy, and smelling like a literal child covered in playdough. Honestly, the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life."

Her hair is fairly wavy but before Mop Top it just looked messy so I always put it up in pony tails.  I got recommended a bunch of products but was looking for a more affordable option for my 4 year old.  I really like this stuff.  It smells great (so good that I use it in my hair to keep down my fly always because of the nice scent!).  It helps define her curls in the morning.  We hair wash at night, so by morning her hair is just a wavy bed head mess.  All I really need is this Mop Top stuff, although sometimes I do a detangler or mousse.  But I've found Mop Top is all I really need to make her hair presentable to wear curly."

I hate stuff that leaves my hair feeling dirty or heavy! I'm so glad I took the leap! I made my mom try it (who never does anything with her hair) and it made her hair so much healthier looking... and brought the curls out so nicely! My niece, who is mixed, tried it... and she loved it as well! So pretty much... it doesn't matter how curly your hair is, or what nationality you are... try this! No regrets!"

I've tried other custards and a flaxseed gel with the same consistency and it just isn't my thing. I have fine hair, and used this at the beginning of my CG transistion, so it was kind of a 2a-2b wave. The product was nice for a wash-and-wear, one product look. It also smells like Sprite to me, which is a pleasant and not over powering smell. Unlike some custards, it didn't make my hair look stringy if I used a little too much. I gave what I had left to a friend with coarser, 3b-3c hair and she likes it as a wash-and-wear as well."

I really like it for both of our hair. It actually leaves my daughter's fine hair kind of plumped. If you leave it in awhile, it deeply moisturizes and feels almost like buttery smooth. Yet still is so light, unlike butters and oils that weigh hair down.  It's keeping my 2B waves much more bouncy as oppose to some of the heavier butter like cowashing I did in the past.  I plan to use this for my daily conditioner."

I’m a loyal Deva Curl user for many years but my curly hair is getting looser the older I get, and a good product is needed more than ever to alleviate frizz and define curl. The smell is a mild citrus, very tolerable, and the texture appears water soluble and blended well into my damp hair. No residue and dried slightly crisp which I could somewhat shake out. However I prefer a stronger hold, especially as the day wears on in humidity. The key is to leave your hair alone when you apply product and that’s always a challenge. With Deva, I combine several different products to get good hold. This one does it all by itself. I’m very pleased so far."

The internet made me buy it—specifically, the real life curly girl on YouTube. I have wavy (2b if you follow curly girl method) hair that is long, medium density, medium thickness, and pretty porous (colored). This product is not heavy, is not crunchy, and provides some volume with zero frizz. It can be used on its own for curl and medium hold or under a gel as just a curl activator. New holy grail—I keep trying other things, and they don’t come close. I was not paid for this review."

This stuff helps my waves hold moisture, they clump beautifully, they last 3 days (with minimal refresh), and I can use it alone if I'm in a rush.

I bought a tub of it back in September 2018 and I just finally ran out in May 2019. Coming on here to order more made me realize I should leave a review! A little bit of this goes a long way and you really don't need to use more than a nickel to quarter size amount depending on how much hair you have. Too much will actually cause you to end up with flakes so definitely start cautiously until you figure your perfect amount out. The photo I attached has the wash day before I received this product not using any curl activators on the left and then the wash adding this product into my line-up on the right.

I have never used a hair custard before. A little goes a looong way which is good for the price. It feels like the slim I used to play with as a little girl, and the smell is nice and citrusy.

My hair has been very easy to style and I'm getting a lot of compliments on it lately. I also love the scent. I just apply the product to wet hair, massage in and then rinse after I've finished washing my face and body. This product is great for any person with curly hair! Highly recommend!!"

However it is NOT great for fine curls. I've been looking everywhere for a good gel for fine curls, and this did say that it was in the description, but it isn't. It left my hair sticky and stringy and with frizz and fly-aways for days. Also, no matter how little I used, there was no scrunching out the crunch. It just stayed crunchy even after diffusing. I'm sure it works well for other hair types, but not fine hair."

I LOVE this shampoo because it is CG-friendly but I still feel CLEAN because it does have a small lather to it (some die-hards claim true CG friendly shampoos have ZERO lather, I'm not a fan of those -- makes me feel like I haven't washed my scalp) and the scent is wonderful.

This product is similar to kinky curly custard, and Camille Rose curl maker, but I find this one to be a little easier to apply & has a pleasant scent (citrus, yum!). My only complaint is that the amount is 8oz, and I wish I could find it in a 12 or 16 oz container bc I must use a lotttttttt of it. I use a hard hold over it bc it doesn't give me a ton of hold, but I always have to use a gel on top of any styler. Gel alone doesn't give me the definition I desire. THIS does!!! Highly recommend!!"

I don't like gunking up my hair with a bunch of products. I just put leave-in conditioner and put this custard in my curly locks and I am in business. Keeps hair moisturized and curls defined. Sometimes I use this without the leave-in conditioner and it holds fine. It does create a cast around that strands, so once hair is dry, just gently scrunch your hair to take out the cast. It holds the curls."

Got more frizz than normal. Was very soft and I did get a small cast so I tried more product and that helped. I just don't think it has the hold I need.

This does form a cast, which I scrunch out. Perfect  define curls  with great shine! No white flakes. This gel and Deva Ultra defining gel are amazing products! Worth the money!

I have very straight, fine, thinning hair that is going through changes due to hormones. It doesn't dry out my scalp, has a lovely, light scent that isn't overpowering at all, especially since I don't usually buy scented things due to allergies. It's great for my kids' hair too, although it stings if it gets in their eyes.

It's my favorite gel for my 3a(ish) hair. I use it in combination with a curl cream, because my hair is thick and needs a lot of moisture, but this product can be a one-step curl routine for finer hair. I like it better than Deva Curl gel. It has better hold and does some special slip action that is very moisturizing and unique to the product. I also like the way it sculpts my curls a little bit more than the Deva gels. I love the definition I get from this product. Although you use a generous amount, I wouldn't load it on too thick, because it is fairly strong. You need to be kind of sparing when reapplying on second day hair--I would recommend not reapplying to the whole head. My only criticism is that it can create slightly more buildup than other lighter gels, like Deva. The smell is citrusy and lovely. The ingredients are VERY clean. Buy, buy, buy."

This stuff is fantastic. I have very dry, thick wavy/curly hair, and it gets weighted down and looks unhealthy. This custard leaves my hair soft and gives me defined curls to even the most stubborn strands of hair that just look frizzy. I've been applying it to wet hair, letting it dry for an hour, and then diffuse. I need to add just a tiny bit more after diffusing to tame flyaways, but that's it. I typically laugh at products that claim you need a quarter sized amount - that's such a load of garbage for anyone with longer, thick hair. But this stuff....you do not need a lot to go along way! This custard has replaced 2 other products that I no longer need in my routine. I'm super happy so far!!!!!!!!!"

To avoid the flake I apply this as soon as I shut off the shower, and before squeezing out my hair. After applying I scrunch out excess water. For all that, the end result is so-so. Not much hold even though it makes your hair pretty crunchy. And if you scrunch the crunch, you might get flakes."

It has a pleasant candy-like smell, and it makes my hair feel super silky when it's applied. It's lightweight and makes my hair feel so silky and soft after a use. However, just a warning, if you apply it to your scalp and do not wash it out all the way with cold water as instructed, it might stick to the scalp and cause some unwanted dandruff."

I wish they made this is in a fragrance-free version. It somewhat holds my curls and reduces frizz so it could be three or four stars without the fragrance.

I've been trying the ""Curly girl"" method on my hair and this is one of the products that was recommended.  I use this on days that I skip shampoo. It provides that ""slippy"" feeling that helps separate curls without damaging but isn't very heavy on the moisturizing/conditioning.  I'll probably try a few others before I buy this one again."

I’m gonna give it 5 starts because of the quality of this product. Smells amazing and curls don’t get that crunchy appearance the other styling gels give. Curls go soft and defined.

After letting that go, I tried it on my wet hair in the shower without gel and it did the opposite of what I was expecting, my hair just puffed up like there was no moisture in it. I tried it the second time the following week and put light gel over it and it weighed down everything. Do not get this product if you have high porosity 2a-3a hair, it is worthless and overpriced."

I have fine 2b/2c hair and this works great. It doesn't weigh my hair down and a little goes a long way. However, I do use this under a gel.

It has the perfect hold that doesn't completely freeze your hair, but still holds. The only issue I have found is that if you aren't careful about evenly distributing this gel, it will clump up and dry into white crusty chunks in your hair. So just be sue to finger comb it through your hair very thoroughly before you scrunch it."

It smells great and gives a good hold. I was honestly kinda shocked how well it works. I would love to give it five stars however if you have a lot of hair like me you can only use it once before washing it out or there will be product build up. So it is not ideal for 2nd or third day hair."

My grandpa used to call me mop top, and I was amused to have it on my counter.  It smelled great, and made a great cast. Sadly it weighed my curls down. No amount of scrunching would bring them back.  On the second day my hair was full of white flakes from the product."

It's a very sweet, strong smell that, even after it dries, is stronger than my perfume. Otherwise, it is a wonderful conditioner that lasts a while and makes my household's type 2 hair look great.

This does not so it doesn't work if used alone for me. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I need the cast for my hair to hold up for 2nd or 3rd day hair. If it's too soft on 1st day hair, it wont hold up. HOWEVER, this product is still GREAT! It adds great definition to your curls and it is very forgiving if you use too much. If you like soft touch hold with defined curls, then this is for you. I actually combine it with another gel. I first use it on really damp hair as a ""primer"" and then finish off with the devacurl arc angel ultra hold gel. I don't have to use nearly as much devacurl gel and the combination of both products give me great definition. I will be purchasing it again."

I truly love it as a curl definer. My hair needs a bit more hold, i have 2C/3A fine hair so i add a bit of strong hold gell afterward. This really leaves curls defined and frizz free for the most part. I add a leave in light conditioner before Moptop custard and my day of curls come out really nice.I also love that this custard is free of silecones and other products that just sit on top of your hair. ++"

The very first time I washed with this shampoo, I noticed that large sections of my scalp were covered in flaking skin. This was mostly an issue around my crown and forehead area. It was the strangest thing; the flaking would begin immediately after use (noticeable even under wet hair) and continue to get worse for the day or two after washing. After the hair dried, it would begin to itch and continue to get itchier as time passed. I'm not sure if it was just dry flaky skin or if it was actual dandruff, but the amount of whatever it was was astonishing (and gross).I stopped using the shampoo after about a week, and my problems stopped then, but I've used it a couple of times since (when I was desperate and out of other shampoos) and had the same problem. It's super weird but I haven't heard of anyone else having the same issue. Other than that, it smelled good and did a fine job washing my actual hair, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else experiences something similar."

I received a sample of this custard and I love it so far! It made my 2C/3A curls even more curly!  I use a denman brush when I wash my hair, then I scrunch this into wet hair on top of homemade flax seed gel.  I only used a nickel sized amount on my thin hair which is just past my shoulders.  My curls were popping like never before!  It does have glycerin but it's winter now so it works great 4 me.  Not sure how well it will work in the humid summer because of the glycerin.I see some reviewers complained about this gel making their hair crunchy but keep in mind you're supposed to scrunch the hardness out of your hair in order to get soft curls.  Other reviewers complained of flaking but this wasn't an issue for me as i used on wet hair and did not mess with my curls after they dried and I ""scrunched out the crunch"".  Maybe ""scrunching out the crunch"" with some light oil would help with that?  Anyway, I give this stuff 2 thumbs up!"

The shampoo was too moisturizing for my hair and the conditioner was ridiculously too oily for my hair. I had a film of oil on my hair and mybody after I tried rinsing it out, so I had to go back and rewash with my regular shampoo. I do not recommend this forsoft fine hair, but I think it would be great for course dry hair."

I don't get it."

It feels like that sugar body scrub you use.  I put some on my damp hair.  It will hold some of the curl in, but when it dries it turns hard like glue then starts to flake.  Compared to Ampro gel, which is much cheaper, I like Ampro better.  Ampro will smooth out my hair and make it straighter as it is holding it down.  Plus when it dries, it is not hard as glue, comes out easy and does not damage hair.  Ampro does very little flaking as well.  Back to that,"

I tried this several times and it was way too heavy for my hair. So, I got the idea of diluting a little with water, so that I could put it in a squeeze bottle and apply to my hair. It works great. My curls look as good with this product as any other curl enhancer that I have used.  I use a few pumps of deva curl ultra defining gel on top."

It doesn’t perform as well as I hoped. Compared to my other leave-ins which are the Kinky Curly Knot Today and the Shea Moisture silicone-free miracle treatment, it just doesn’t penetrate my hair strands as much and i gel it sort of sits on top of my hair. I also have to apply a lot of it to get any sort of effect. I don’t think I will be reaching for this product often."

But this one, man oh man! I am glad that I found this product!!!! I’ve always tried curly hair girl approved products , but they always weight down my curls and my hair gets super frizzy even though I diffuse. I don’t diffuse at all , so it would make me upset that even though I diffuse my hair would still get super frizzy! I would try so many methods and nothing! However, this product , I recently purchased the sample packets off their Instagram page. And I am so happy that I finally found a product that does justice to my hair!!!! Thank you, thank you!

Turns out it wasn’t for me. I like no-crunch custard and this leaves my hair dry, frizzy and crunchy.  And if I put it in my hair a little too much, it leaves some white flakes. I live in East Asia so maybe the climate can be one of the reason why it’s not doing the work? Anyhow I would recommend this for someone who likes crunchy strong hold gel, but I wouldn’t personally buy it again."

I’ve used it twice so far and am just not impressed. It works okay... but it doesn’t have as much slip as I hoped so it’s hard to finger detangle my hair. It does clean my hair but I feel it is stripping away some moisture. When I compare it to the other Co-wash I own, which is the AS I AM Coconut cowash, it doesn’t perform as well."
796,"MopTop Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily, Color Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",2.0 out of 5 stars,This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely,"This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely, and helps keep the curl controlled as my hair dries.  Does not make my hair frizzy.  It smells nice, sweet like some kind of candy.  The reason for 2 stars is the bottle it comes in.  The product itself is pretty thick, like pudding.  It does not flow.  The plastic bottle it's in is thick hard plastic. It's ridiculously difficult to squeeze a thick, pudding-like product out of a narrow-necked stiff plastic bottle.  If you take the cap off you can ""shake"" it out, which is what I do, but it's not ideal considering that sometimes it shakes out a huge glob bigger than you need, which is a hassle again to scrape the excess back in.  The directions for use on the bottle state in bold letters, ""shake well"".  Lol, how do you shake this product well, especially when the bottle is brand new and filled to the top, and for what purpose?  Does the product separate as it sits it something.  No.  I just think there must be a lot of people in the company who don't understand the product or use it themselves.  The product would be better contained in a jar with a lid that you can dip your fingers into, or maybe a soft squeezable tube that can be stored upside down.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It doesn't seem like the manufacturer understands its own product. It's not exactly a bargain price either."

However, for my thick, frizzy 2B hair, this custard totally weighed down my hair. It didn't even work like a gel — no definition, no crunch. My hair was flatter than ever.

I like the gentle shampoo because it cleaned my hair without stripping all the natural oils.  The deep conditioner didn't give me the same kind of slip for detangling as the the daily conditioner, but it did what it said it would do.  The leave it in conditioner gave my hair a light hold like a gel without the crunchy hardness of a gel.  It also left my hair soft and smooth.  I will for sure buy the leave it in conditioner and the gentle shampoo again.  I gave this review a 4 not 5 stars because the deep conditioner doesn't have the same slip as the daily conditioner.  The daily conditioner is the best conditioner for slip I have every used.  If you have frizzy curly hair these products are awesome.  It costs more, but these products are very high in and they work.  I have kinky curly hair and I love these products.  BTW it your hair is protein sensitive don't use the deep conditioner more then once a week."

I applied a generous amount of this product to a section of my hair last nite and my curls were still a bit crunchy. I thought that maybe I had product build up in my hair so I shampooed my hair today and re-applied a generous amount again to my entire hair and my curls were still a bit crunchy and stiff so I decided to ponytail my hair and leave a few strands out. This product smells amazing but didn’t give me the moist curls & softness as described. I’ll come back and give y’all an overall honest review once the entire bottle is done and I’ve sampled it on several styles.

The consistency is both thinner and a bit stickier than what I've been used to, but it's working for me just as well.  For context, my hair is naturally wavy/curly when short.  After washing I apply a small dab of leave-in conditioner, then use the custard, push into shape with my fingers and air dry.I have bits of hair on the side of my head that are a little stubborn with trying to curl the wrong direction and this holds them in place.  Which is good considering I've been resorting to at-home covid-cuts lol."

I heard about on from CurlyPenny on YouTube and she swears by this stuff.

My hair is suuuuper thick, coarse, and I have a lot of it. It's curly/wavy but I know some little curls are hidden in there! The best method I found for me was to bring it with me in the shower, and after I rinse my conditioner out with cold water, I put a generous amount of this in my hair with my head upside down with a crunching motion. Try it! All in all I do love it and I may buy it again once I run out, unless I find something even better!"

However, it has no preservatives in it and can actually “go bad” if it sits to long. I usually get it from my hair salon, but found it here on amazon and decided to order it. When it arrived, the tubs were wrapped in additional plastic (which is different from the salon) and the safety seal was missing. The thing that bothered me though was the color, consistency and smell of the product. It is supposed to smell wonderful (somewhat sweet but not overpowering) with a light opal color the consistency of thick honey. This was fowl smelling, runny and darker than it was supposed to be. Long story long, great product but buy it at a store so you can check it’s color!"
1,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Staple product, consistent results.","This is one of my staple products. I have 2B, low porosity, fine-medium strands, high density hair. This custard smells great and is very concentrated, ensure you emulsify well when applying.  Custards don’t typically provide a lot of hold but I do think this product has a good amount of hold on its own. I typically use it on wash days but have used it to refresh and it will revive and hold my waves. Product smells great, citrusy like a Kumquat but the smell unfortunately will not linger (I personally would love to smell like this product all day long). The product does contain protein and glycerin. It has held up well even in humidity despite the glycerin content. This is likely because I DO layer this product with 2 other stylers that I think are a great combination and compliment each other superbly. I use the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curl Magic as a base, Moptop Curl Custard second, and seal the deal with Jessie Curl Spiralicious. In the pictures my hair looks wet/shiny, but it is fully dry FYI.In case you are wondering I use a cowash, As I Am 2 out of my 3 weekly wash days and clarify with Bounce Curl Clarifying Shampoo, and condition with Bounce Curl Super Smooth conditioner.I went crazy buying a bunch of products when I transitioned to embracing my natural hair, but hands down this product with the combination I mentioned above is a definite winner for my hair type. As you can see, I was so confident in my line-up that I went out to my first dressy outing sporting my natural hair for the first time since my transition and I was not disappointed. It gave me such confidence to know you can look “put together” with wavy/textured hair."
2,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,great custard,"This is indeed a great custard, better than the other super famous custard, Kinky Curly. With moptop hair dries faster, I get better definition and glossy clumps. My hair is 2c, fine but dense, dry, heavily highlighted. I really get beautiful results. It is pretty forgiving, as if you use too much, you can easily scrunch out the cast and it won't weight your hair down a bit...this is another big difference with kinky curly...with my hair type it is pretty much impossible to get volume with kinky curly custard, but I get ton of body with lots of movement with moptop custard. The only con is the high content of glycerin that causes frizz in the super humid, high dew points days we have here in Florida. In those days, I can't usually use moptop by itself as a solo styler, but I need to top it with a hard hold-no/low glycerin gel (great with AG liquid effects, or Biosilk hard rock gelee). Not a big deal, I still get the good definition and bounciness moptop gives."

I have wavy frizzy hair and this left my hair with almost totally frizz free, soft, bouncy curls. It definitely has a funky slimy texture with a strong fruity citrus smell but the smell dissipates as it dries.Pros:Adds shineSoft not crunchy curlsLightweightNatural ingredientsAffordableCons:Tames most frizz but not allOverall I am pleased to have this on hand. It is a much better alternative to the unhealthy ingredients I got from my previous gel. Still looking for something natural to completely tame my frizz without looking like a grease ball.UPDATE: After a few months of use I found that if I use a little more on top where I'm most prone to get frizz it will make a slight cast that I can break after it dries and then I'm frizz free! I just pull the locks through my fingers to unstiffen it until it looks natural.I'm also so impressed with how much volume I get with this. It doesn't weigh down my hair even though I add extra on top. Updating my rating to 5 stars. I use it daily after showering or to refresh curls. I still have plenty left. I'd guess with my medium length hair it will last at least 6 months. Great natural product and value!"

8,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",3.0 out of 5 stars,Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-aloe,"I wanted to love this gel, I really did, but it's just not for me. It smells amazing and it has this really interesting thin consistency that seems perfect for not weighing down my curls.And yet, here I am, the fourth wash day using this product, and I have conceded defeat. I kept getting fuzzy, frizzy, stringy, undefined curls and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Turns out, aloe is a problem for a lot of curlies. If your hair is instantly frizzing and losing it's ""clumpage"" when you add this gel, consider that your hair might not like aloe. Look up flash-drying.I don't want to give this product a bad rating just because I didn't know aloe wouldn't work with my hair. After all, it seems to work well for lots of people! I just hope this review helps someone else who is struggling with this gel and can't figure out why."

   This stuff is my new go-to! Wish i found it sooner.I’ve never been quite sure what the difference between gel and custard/jelly is — there are so many different types of products out there! But in my experience I’ve found custards and jellys to clump my hair nicely but not necessarily define them, and I’ve found them to leave my hair looking a little greasy and leaving a weird residue on them, whereas I’ve found gels to define and hold hair much better, but often leave it crunchy with lots of flyaways. Also, gels hold seems to be too strong and leaves a lot of my waves/curls misshapen. This product has a unique texture, not 100% like either gel or jelly (see video)My hair ranges from ‘s’ wave patterns to curls (mostly underneath.) The top is prone to extreme frizziness and just general “poof” and the front pieces that frame my face are prone to losing all wave pattern. This product seems to address all my hair concerns: manages frizz, boosts curl patterns where it’s needed, and holds pretty well without leaving a weird greasy residue.Overall I’d say this product is the perfect medium between jelly and gel! More hold than a jelly but less crunch than a gel. It smells great too and i like that it comes in a jar. I use a leave in conditioner/curl cream first and then use this product to scrunch my hair, let it dry, and I’m good to go.Hope this product helps someone struggling with their hair as much as it helped me! For the price you can’t go wrong giving it a chance— I’m so glad i did :)"

Great for curly, frizzy, wavy hair in any humidity","This stuff is great! It smells slightly citrusy but not sweet, a little like baby aspirin, lol, but the smell is nice and is not strong. The texture is hard to describe - it is thick and maybe best described like ""slime"" but not slimy. It is thick and luxurious. You will only need a little to apply to your hair; I have long, thick hair, and I use about two quarter size blobs. Run through wet or damp hair and comb through, fluff your curls and then leave your hair alone. You will find that your curls are well defined, moist, and not frizzy at all. The product can be a little stiff, but if you shake your hair out, the stiffness goes away. There is absolutely no flaking at all with this product. I am also allergic to a lot of gels and mousses (the perfumes cause scalp problems), but I have no problems with this product at all. I'm picky with hair products, and I've tried a million of them. I will buy this one again!"

I have wavy 2b hair, and ever since using this product I've noticed such a change in its texture and shine. I can go longer between wash days, which in turn means my hair is looking a lot healthier and shinier. My main concern when first buying this was that it wouldn't lather as well or that my hair wouldn't be as clean and I am so happy I was wrong. The lather is a little less voluminous than your standard bottle of shampoo but it will still keep your hair very clean without making it feel like straw. Aside from all of this, a major highlight of this shampoo is the bamboo scent. I have been asked by three to four people about this shampoo because of the smell alone.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger size ( please make a 16 oz. version!!). Highly recommend!"

Liquids are too light and don't offer enough slip, and creams are too heavy and leave my waves/curls weighed down. This one is just right! It looks like a thick cream but it goes on very light. I apply it from my ears down and it leaves me with bouncy, moist curls. I adore the bamboo essence scent, which is very light and fresh with a slight citrus smell to it."

Along with Curly Girl advice, I have kept my thinning strands from frizzing (thanks Mother Nature) using that mousse and conditioning with every wash.  But I was curious to try a curly hair custard and, on a whim, bought this.  I am so glad I did. This holds my large spiral pattern as well as my old mousse, but my hair looks fuller, feels bouncier and softer.  Like there's nothing weighing it down. And on day 2, I can spritz my hair with water, scrunch, and it perks right up again.  Trying that with the Garnier left my hair looking a little flat and dirty.A small amount does the trick on my shoulder length bob, applied by scrunching it thru fairly wet strands and then carefully drying with a diffuser.  The citrus scent is nice.  The price no longer bothers me because that container is going to last me awhile and the results can't be beat.  Highly recommend!"

I had previously ordered a sample packet from moptop directly and LOVED the conditioner. I ordered through amazon because I had a credit on my account.

But my curls just aren’t as full and I would have to completely re-do my hair daily if I didn’t want to just shove it in a bun. You know what I mean- totally wet it, work in fresh product, diffuse.....I have enough hair that that gets annoying.BUT with Mop Top I get out of the shower on day one and split my wet hair down the middle, over my shoulders, take a very small scoop of the goo and twist and finger brush it through each section. Then I flip my head, scrunch my hair and diffuse.I have noticed that a tiny bit of product goes a long way and it can get crunchy, but I solve that by just rolling my curls between my hands in sections to loosen the crunch and it’s perfect!Then, my favorite part about this product:I don’t wash my hair every day when I shower. I may go 3-4 days no wash. But like I said with my previous product: I would have to re-do the entire curly process if I wanted my hair done daily. NOT with Mop Top. A few sprays with a water bottle to reform the bed head (not even enough worth diffuse drying) and boom! My hair looks like day one! For all three days! No extra product!

It foams up great and the bamboo essence scent is divine (it's a fresh, light scent with a hint of citrus). It cleans thoroughly, but like all sulfate free shampoos, there are some tricks to helping it clean properly. You must use LOTS of water...add more water, not more product, if you feel like you need more cleaning power. Also, let it sit just a bit longer than regular shampoo. After that it will leave your hair squeaky clean, with no scalp irritation from harsh sulfates. It does not dry my hair out."

I have tried so many products so when I came across this stuff I was like Yes! I need to try it. Well the first time I applied it I didn't seem to put enough in my hair (it doesn't state how much to put in your hair so it's trial and error I guess). Before I used it the next time I searched You Tube I found the creators page and watched how she applied it. Well she put on tons it seemed. My hair is about 3 inches shorter and so I tried to adjust the amount. My hair came out crunchy and nothing like hers. Then later that night my hair looked like I had dandruff and my head itched the rest of the night. I should have washed my hair that night because my scalp itched all night. I got up first thing and washed my hair really good but it still itched. I don't think I'll try it again for that reason. I can't stand my scalp itching!

I take sections of my hair and mix together a cream and Jessicurl Spiralicious, apply to hair, and then I apply Mop Top. I brush each section with a Denman brush and smooth each section to encourage clumping. Then I scrunch the hell out of it and fix the wonky curls.

I was recommended to try this, but I couldn't find it in the local stores.  I purchased on Amazon, and it does work for my hair.  Makes it more curly and not all frizzy.  I don't have to use that much either, so this will last a good amount of time.  I do only wash twice a week though.  I just wish this wasn't so expensive, but I am willing to pay this being as it is so hard for me to find the right styling products for my hair!!UPDATE:  This worked great in the winter months but not doing all that good in the summer being as it has glycerin in this.

That is when I discovered that I have low porosity hair, and that the Deva curl gel is full of protein, which is not good for low porosity hair So, I went looking for something with minimal protein and found the Mop Top curly hair custard. I wasn't expecting much, because there are no curl holding chemicals in this gel, but I was very surprised to see that my hair was both fluffy and curly after just one little scoop (3 fingers) of gel. With Mop Top, less is more, so you don't need much. To refresh second day curls, just put a dash of gel and leave in conditioner in a small spray bottle with water. Spray and scrunch, and your curls will hold another day or two, even on fine hair. What I like the most is that this product never weighs down your hair. And it smells citrusy, which I like a lot."

Then I tried a MopTop sample kit and loved this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has the perfect consistency - not too thick but not too watery. For a low-poo it sudses up amazingly, and is easy to scrub into my scalp. I can tell it doesn't cleanse my scalp as well as my clarifying shampoo, but that is to be expected. I will use it 3 out of 4 washes to encourage the natural oils in my hair. It has a great balance of protein vs. moisture. And best of all is the scent - I didn't know bamboo could smell so good! It is an addicting sweet/fresh scent that makes me really look forward to wash days.

I add this right after leave-in and just before I apply a hard cast gel; I can literally feel it sucking the water into the core of my strands, and it takes my hair from dripping to just saturated with one application.

I'm currently using the no-poo cleansing conditioner, the daily conditioner, the leave-in conditioner, and the Curly Hair Custard. The custard was my first purchase and came with some samples from the rest of the line.I will say it works much better with a little extra moisture underneath. After conditioning (or cleansing and conditioning if it's ""wash"" day) I apply a tiny bit of the leave-in while still in the shower with SOAKING wet hair. Then I step out and apply a liberal amount of the Curly Custard, being sure to flip upside-down and side-to-side. Then scrunch scrunch scrunch. I let it air dry then loosen the cast once it's completely dry. This can also be done with a diffuser, but I don't have time for blow dryers. I find I see a lot more frizz if I skip the leave-in."

Didn't provide any better results than lesser expensive products I can buy at my local retail outlet. I bought this because it is natural and minus the sulfates, which can dry out and damage hair and scalp. My scalp has been dry for some time and I have psoriasis, which does flare up from time to time., especially when my scalp is dry. I also changed shampoos at the same time, using a cleansing conditoner free of sulfates.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't really made a difference. Additonally, it tends to create a slightly crispy texture in my hair.  This will probably not be the experience for most people as I have very, very kinky, frizzy curly hair. Although each folicle is very fine, I have a lot of it, and WITH the extreme curl, it often feels almost coarse.I am Scotch Irish and just have crazier hair than most people here buying this product. However, if you share my genetic predisposition, please understand that this may not work for you either.That all being said, the product came well packaged and smells really nice.

Research suggested that hair similar to mine benefits most from lightweight, moisturizing products. I ended up focusing more on using a lower number of moisturizing products instead of multiple lightweight products. I've used As I Am Leave In Conditioner for my dry hair since before I started this hair journey but decided to ditch it if I'm going to add on a curl activator/enhancer/gel. I tried Cantu Curl Activator, which did almost nothing to define my waves and made my hair more frizzy. I tried Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie which did help enhance my waves (not in the back though), provided decent moisture, reduced some frizz, but did not have much hold- next day waves were basically not a thing and frizz was back. Adding in Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel gave me almost no hold (Upon purchasing I didn't realize it was a light hold gel) and was very drying so I ditched that quickly and replaced it with Eco Style Gel (strong hold gel). It did help with definition and hold all around, not drying, but it wasn't optimal. I moved on to Aunt Jackie's Defining Curl Custard and no gel which impressed me with the moisture, decent hold, reduced frizz, and enhanced definition even in the 2A back of my hair- but it contains silicones that I knew would eventually weigh down my hair. Mop Top Curly Hair Custard Gel had been on my list of CGM approved products to try and I should've gone with it ages ago because this product goes beyond Aunt Jackie's. I have defined waves all around, equal hold, and it is moisturizing. I've gotten the best defined next day waves compared to all other products I've tried. With other/no products, my halo frizz is usually worse the second and third day- but even with humectants being predominant in this product, I have had no halo frizz. I usually get frizz in both dry and humid environments, I have not yet had a chance to test it on a sufficiently humid day. I am optimistic though."

I've purchased some creams and mousses recently to make the most out of my curls, but all of the products I've tried have always resulted in tacky-to-the-touch, frizzy and crunchy stiff hair.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos and some of the ladies raved about this product and their curls did look lovely so I thought I'd by a jar and give it a try.  My jar arrived today and tonight I tried it.  It's AMAZING!!!  I towel dried my hair and applied this product to my damp hair.  This ""custard"" is runny but a little goes a long way so it didn't take much to cover my thin/fine hair.  I loved that it wasn't tacky and cause my hair to stick to my hand when I applied it.  I let my hair air-dry and I was happy to see that every time I checked on it, my curls were curling and there wasn't any frizz in sight!  When my hair was about  75% dry, I decided to defuse it and really give it the frizz test.  Once again... no frizz and my curls were even more prominent!  I've been disappointed by so many products over the years so I am so incredibly happy to find a hair product that surpassed my expectations!  I'm new to MopTop hair products but I'll definitely be giving other MopTop products a try in the future.I highly recommend this product."

It didn't.  If I stick with this and the MopTop shampoo, I get a ton of buildup and my hair just looks and feels gross.I do have very hard water, so if yours is soft, you might have better results, but I'll be looking for something else."
46,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT for Kinky/Coily/Transitioning hair!,I was excited to try after reading so many fabulous reviews. I used this after using shampoo and conditioner and it was NOT thick enough nor did I feel like it penetrated the hair shaft. I tend to look the other way when I see a product that claims to work on ALL hair types including fine hair... I am a women of color and my hair is FAR from fine. Save your money if you have kinky coarse textured hair as this will not be enough for you. If you have fine hair and are type 3 and above will probably work great for you.

It burns when you wash hair. And then a day later I got an unbearable sharp pain in my eyes that I could not open them because it felt like knife is cutting right through them. It took me a few episodes to understand what was causing that pain a day later after the wash. Stopped using a product and the pain did not come back. Never buying any of Moptop products again!

I decided to give their leave-in Conditioner a try as I do still get the flyaway frizzy stuff especially in humid weather . I have to admit that it feels strange when first applying to my hair , and I initially thought this would turn out to  be too heavy for my fine , slightly wavy hair , however after drying ( I only partially blow dry , I don't have enough time to be bothered with a full blow dry ) my hair isn't weighed down , it doesn't look greasy , it's shiny , smells good and it's soft . The frizzies are reduced to almost non existent . You don't need to use a lot of this either , my hair is half way down my back and it's fairly thick , I only use an amount that would equal maybe 2 nickels stacked on my palm and it does the job ."

I can use a small amount (less than a teaspoon for sure) on my thick, wavy-to-curly, shoulder length hair and I get nice, soft, lovely waves/curls for at least three days. It renews with water in the morning. Plus, my head never gets itchy and there’s no build up of product on my hair or scalp. I’m using it with other brands of sulfate and paraben free shampoo and conditioner, but when I run out, I’m curious to try other MopTop products! It’s a pleasure to simply shampoo, condition and apply just this one styling product!"

But the humidity is now at a point here in Georgia that I can’t wear it straight even with anti-humidity hairspray. Some aspects that I was dreading was my hair not drying for six hours and significant gel residue on the nape of my neck and on my chest that is even hard to get off with wet towel.  Thankfully Kinky Curly was out of stock. I washed my hair and applied Moptop and went outside in the hot sun and did yardwork. Sweating profusely. Most of my hair dried though! I pulled and stretched out the curls and still have good definition. Going out for a walk with temp still 86f. Will see how good of a hold I keep. That is always a challenge for me though. End of day my curls have lost a lot of definition. I have super fine non porous bi racial hair and have to scrunch my hair to get curls and use tangle teaser too, to help bring out my curls. Very pleased"

I went from frizz to happy curls in a matter of a few washes. It's difficult to keep my hair moisturized out here in the dry desert, so it's so satisfying to see happy hair after years of struggling with Hagrid hair.The only downfall was the packaging. The bottles were just thrown in a paper sack with a little bit of tape on their lids. Unfortunately the shampoo opened and I lost a good amount of shampoo."

It smells like nailpolish remover, and while it feels rather slimy or oily going on, it leaves my hair extremely dry. An hour after application, my hair looks like a frazzled mess that hasn't been conditioned in ages. The weird chemical smell lingers and is pretty unbearable, too. Hair feels somehow both dry and greasy (!) to the touch.I have wavy 2b/2c hair and this might work for other types, even though this type of product usually works quite well for me, so I really just think it's this particular brand.I see other reviews saying that the product sold on Amazon might have gone bad or is not comparable to the product you can buy elsewhere. Maybe that's the problem? Either way, I strongly recommend you don't order this for your hair!"

I have mulitextured hair ranging from 2b to 3a. It's fine to medium and medium density. The Moptop custard does not weigh my hair down at all and it doesn't leave a productly film I often get from other products. It definitely enhances my texture and gives me volume. I do have to top it off with another product for additional hold but that doesn't bother me...this stuff is holy grail for me.

It has shine and softness again.  No other deep conditioner has worked this effectively.  This morning I used Quidad moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (blue line), then It's a 10 leave-in + keratin (orange top) spray onto drenched curls, and easily finger-combed the Mop Top curl custard through, and scrunched several times.  Plopped my hair up in terry turban, while completing other tasks worth about 5-7 minutes. Removed towel and clipped roots up.  Once dry enough, removed clips.  My hair looked so good all work day.  Left a light gel cast, similar to Devacurl gel, until I manually loosened them up.  Then the hair was soft and even more shiny.  This product is a must if you have over dry curls."

I’m a guy with medium length mixed 3a/c curls and most specialty products targeted at my hair type are either too heavy or too drying. Have spent hundreds of dollars on product over the past two years. Nothing I’ve tried before has been this good.Hold, moisture, and shine all in one product. No need to layer product for my hair. Routine since purchasing: Co-Wash with a cheap CG-approved conditioner, glide pick through hair, rinse, apply glob of Mop Top root to end, air dry and forget about it."

I am using mostly the As I Am product line but they lack a true conditioner. I tried this conditioner to add moisture to my hair. While it does that and makes it very soft. It adds a lot of weight to my hair and adds to the frizzy. But if you are looking for moisture this is a great product.

I have 3B curls, and it really leaves my hair soft and bouncy, people stop me in my tracks to ask what I use.  Love the light cast it leaves once it dries, which I massage out to take my look to a soft non crunchy look.  I also love that there isn't a heavy scent - it's just right and fades away once dry. I hope the company keeps using the jar because that;'s the easiest way to style my curls, I just hate it when companies switch their products to bottles."

As mentioned in another review, this is so strongly scented as to exclude one from many public places. The curly custard smelt strongly of citrus, but the leave in, I’m sorry to have to say, smells chemical and just nasty. I know other people have said it smells great, so each to their own. Btw, I’m not smell sensitive, and have never complained about scent before. Jsyk."

The barcode/info sticker looked like it had gotten wet at some point. However the contents of the container appear to be in good condition.Performance: nice texture to the gel, applies easily, smells good, dries relatively quickly. Decent amount of hold but more difficult to completely break the cast than Kinky Curly custard. Does have a lot of glycerin in it so it is not good in the summer humidity. My normally minimally frizzy 2b wavy hair looked poodle-esk after only a few minutes out air conditioning. I also had some white flaking as it apparently interacts with Miss Jessie’s  curl cream.Overall it’s an okay purchase if it’s not humid outside and I’m in a hurry to leave the house with dry hair. I think it will be more of a winter product and will update back."

Everything else has too much protein, or too much oil for my hair, leaving it dry and brittle. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it. This moisturizes very well, but never leaves my hair weighed down or greasy. It actually gets into my hair shaft, rather then just sitting on top! I have tried so many conditioners, and can not handle chemical smells. This is scented with citrus essenial oils, and the smell does not linger. It is also a very pure, natural product, which is very important to me. I am very grateful to mop top for making such a wonderful product. If not for this, my poor hair would be dry as a dessert.

Frankly, this would probably be my favorite product of all time if it weren't for the sickly-sweet and overpowering scent that just reminds me of cheap sugary products. I don't smell the ""citrus"" at all. I used it this morning and although the scent has faded over time, my headache that came from it is still lingering. If there's an unscented version of this product, I'd jump on it without hesitation. As is, though, I wouldn't buy it again."

Used this tonight for the first time during squish to condish, after applying a leave in.

It did create a *little bit* of a cast.My hair looks great, however next time I'll use a little more product and see what happens. And then I'll try a bit of gel with it, and report back. So far I am very happy with this product."

If you like smelling like candied coconut mixed with playdough...you'll love this scent! I had to spray hairspray or perfume on my head anytime I conditioned with this. Not only that, it left the most residue and buildup in my hair I've ever had. Let me remind you, I used this for 3 months, not changing any other products and this conditioner made my hair greasy, stringy, and smelling like a literal child covered in playdough. Honestly, the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life."

Her hair is fairly wavy but before Mop Top it just looked messy so I always put it up in pony tails.  I got recommended a bunch of products but was looking for a more affordable option for my 4 year old.  I really like this stuff.  It smells great (so good that I use it in my hair to keep down my fly always because of the nice scent!).  It helps define her curls in the morning.  We hair wash at night, so by morning her hair is just a wavy bed head mess.  All I really need is this Mop Top stuff, although sometimes I do a detangler or mousse.  But I've found Mop Top is all I really need to make her hair presentable to wear curly."

I hate stuff that leaves my hair feeling dirty or heavy! I'm so glad I took the leap! I made my mom try it (who never does anything with her hair) and it made her hair so much healthier looking... and brought the curls out so nicely!

I've tried other custards and a flaxseed gel with the same consistency and it just isn't my thing. I have fine hair, and used this at the beginning of my CG transistion, so it was kind of a 2a-2b wave. The product was nice for a wash-and-wear, one product look. It also smells like Sprite to me, which is a pleasant and not over powering smell. Unlike some custards, it didn't make my hair look stringy if I used a little too much. I gave what I had left to a friend with coarser, 3b-3c hair and she likes it as a wash-and-wear as well."

I really like it for both of our hair. It actually leaves my daughter's fine hair kind of plumped. If you leave it in awhile, it deeply moisturizes and feels almost like buttery smooth. Yet still is so light, unlike butters and oils that weigh hair down.  It's keeping my 2B waves much more bouncy as oppose to some of the heavier butter like cowashing I did in the past.  I plan to use this for my daily conditioner."

I chose this because it was recommended by the CGM website for those with long 2A hair. It rinses well where I do not have to stand long in the shower just to rinse it off.

I’m a loyal Deva Curl user for many years but my curly hair is getting looser the older I get, and a good product is needed more than ever to alleviate frizz and define curl. The smell is a mild citrus, very tolerable, and the texture appears water soluble and blended well into my damp hair. No residue and dried slightly crisp which I could somewhat shake out. However I prefer a stronger hold, especially as the day wears on in humidity. The key is to leave your hair alone when you apply product and that’s always a challenge. With Deva, I combine several different products to get good hold. This one does it all by itself. I’m very pleased so far."

The internet made me buy it—specifically, the real life curly girl on YouTube. I have wavy (2b if you follow curly girl method) hair that is long, medium density, medium thickness, and pretty porous (colored). This product is not heavy, is not crunchy, and provides some volume with zero frizz. It can be used on its own for curl and medium hold or under a gel as just a curl activator. New holy grail—I keep trying other things, and they don’t come close. I was not paid for this review."

I've tried KCCC (many curly girls holy grail product) and it's way too heavy and pulls out my curls/waves no matter how little I use or how much emulsify with water. This stuff helps my waves hold moisture, they clump beautifully, they last 3 days (with minimal refresh), and I can use it alone if I'm in a rush. This is my holy grail custard...but pair it with Ecoslay Orange Marmalade for phenomenal results (and 3-4day hair)!"

This stuff cleans really well , doesn't irritate my scalp , smells great and paired with the daily conditioner makes my hair soft . It helps tame some of the frizz , not all of it . I have highlighted hair that's slightly wavy and haven't seen where this shampoo has removed any of the color . An added bonus is that my scalp is feeling much better after 2 weeks of using this shampoo no more bumps along hairline or scalp . I just wish it wasn't so pricey ."

HOWEVER, the smell is overwhelming and never goes away.  It's bad enough to give me a headache.  I have eczema and I'm pretty sure if I use it too often, it'll end up making it flare up so I don't recommend this if you have eczema or asthma or are otherwise sensitive to scents.For now, I'm using homemade flaxseed gel and just layering a small amount of this over it.  I really wish MopTop would make an unscented version or just not dump an entire vat of fragrance into their otherwise wonderful product."

I'm still experimenting with it, so we'll see. But I also had to knock some points off because the overwhelming stink of lemon pledge! Thankfully the smell goes away when it dries, but it doesn't seem like a good thing for it to smell like floor cleaner in the first place. Overall, I'm far from impressed. 👎"

I bought a tub of it back in September 2018 and I just finally ran out in May 2019. Coming on here to order more made me realize I should leave a review! A little bit of this goes a long way and you really don't need to use more than a nickel to quarter size amount depending on how much hair you have. Too much will actually cause you to end up with flakes so definitely start cautiously until you figure your perfect amount out. The photo I attached has the wash day before I received this product not using any curl activators on the left and then the wash adding this product into my line-up on the right. I think it's pretty obvious that it works!

I was so self consious of my hair all day I ended up putting it in a messy bun (on a wash day, ugh!).

I used this product alone and it worked fine. It does leave a crunchy cast which is good for wavy/curly girls to maintain a curl pattern. I scrunch it out later if I air dry or even after I diffuse. I have never used a hair custard before. A little goes a looong way which is good for the price. It feels like the slim I used to play with as a little girl, and the smell is nice and citrusy. It is up in the air if I will repurchase it and if so, it won't be for a long time because the tub is large."

I was putting MT over my B'Leave In and the results were good but not great. I used it alone and BAM! I had to die for curls. What works for me is to coat my hair, scrunch and plop for 30 minutes and then diffuse without touching my hair at high heat high speed until 80% dry, then go for the roots at medium heat/speed, then finish on the ends. WORTH THE WORK! I finally love my wavy/curly hair!"

Amazon was sold out of my usual gel last time, so I ordered this instead. It does an okay job holding curls together (similar to other nice gels I've tried) and only causes a moderate amount of ""crispiness"" in areas where you apply too much. The thing that I can't stand about this gel is the horrible smell! It smells like chemicals to me. I even had my boyfriend comment on the weird smell when my hair was wet.

It's not quite a defining gel,  but a product that will ""encourage"" waves into curls.The best way to use it is right after washing your hair, scrunching upwards.

However it is NOT great for fine curls. I've been looking everywhere for a good gel for fine curls, and this did say that it was in the description, but it isn't. It left my hair sticky and stringy and with frizz and fly-aways for days. Also, no matter how little I used, there was no scrunching out the crunch. It just stayed crunchy even after diffusing.

My only complaint is that the amount is 8oz, and I wish I could find it in a 12 or 16 oz container bc I must use a lotttttttt of it. I use a hard hold over it bc it doesn't give me a ton of hold, but I always have to use a gel on top of any styler. Gel alone doesn't give me the definition I desire. THIS does!!! Highly recommend!!"

Unfortunately, it had oozed out of the jar despite being wrapped in bubble wrap because there was no seal on the inside of the product.  It makes me concerned about the product integrity.  Not sure if I'll order again based on that, and that bums me out."
132,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure its for me,Left curls less defined than my normal routine. Got more frizz than normal. Was very soft and I did get a small cast so I tried more product and that helped. I just don't think it has the hold I need. Scent is very overpowering and I smell it all day and it's very distracting. Also this sucked up a lot of water when styling so I had to rewet my hair several times more than normal.

I absolutely love the smell, but it doesn't work as well as some other gels. It still does a pretty solid job for my 2B/2C mix hair. My biggest issue is that if I put a little it doesn't hold and if I put more in it flakes off to where I can see small dust-like parts coming of my hair."

I had never used leave-in conditioner because my fine thin hair was easily weighed down.  This product dries and leaves my hair soft looking without that ""wet hair"" appearance some products give you.  I have already reordered!"

This is great for wavy to curly hair. I put this on my hair while it’s very wet and don’t touch it until my hair is completely dry. For me that can be up to 2 hours. This does form a cast, which I scrunch out. Perfect  define curls  with great shine! No white flakes. This gel and Deva Ultra defining gel are amazing products! Worth the money! I will continue to purchase this product!"

I have fine, high porosity hair with a 3a curl pattern that is VERY frizz prone and loves protein. I use just this product mixed with neutral protein filler drops and my results have been amazing- no other gels or leave ins needed. You only use a small amount so it’s great value too. Can’t recommend highly enough."

The last time I tried I was using things waaaaaaaaay too heavy for my 2b fine hair and the experiment didn’t last long. It’s definitely a journey!I looooooove this custard! The clumping I’m getting after the first use is bananas! I’m a little worried that my 2nd day hair will be too weighed down, so next time I might try without a leave in or oils and just use this custard with a gel for more hold. Interested to try more mop top items now."

It seems to keep the hair moisturized. It can be crunchy or sheer as you like it.

This custard does a great job at defining curls and limiting frizz. I have dry, 3B hair and I use about a tablespoon of this product each time I have a wash day. It's a bit pricy and the jar is small, so I'm holding off on buying another jar, and I am just using an alcohol-free gel from the grocery store for now. But the next time this goes on sale I'll be buying some more!"

I have very straight, fine, thinning hair that is going through changes due to hormones. It doesn't dry out my scalp, has a lovely, light scent that isn't overpowering at all, especially since I don't usually buy scented things due to allergies. It's great for my kids' hair too, although it stings if it gets in their eyes. My friend with thick, lushious hair (on the oily side) mentioned it didn't rinse out of her hair well, but I love the extra moisture."

It's my favorite gel for my 3a(ish) hair. I use it in combination with a curl cream, because my hair is thick and needs a lot of moisture, but this product can be a one-step curl routine for finer hair. I like it better than Deva Curl gel. It has better hold and does some special slip action that is very moisturizing and unique to the product. I also like the way it sculpts my curls a little bit more than the Deva gels. I love the definition I get from this product. Although you use a generous amount, I wouldn't load it on too thick, because it is fairly strong. You need to be kind of sparing when reapplying on second day hair--I would recommend not reapplying to the whole head. My only criticism is that it can create slightly more buildup than other lighter gels, like Deva. The smell is citrusy and lovely. The ingredients are VERY clean. Buy, buy, buy."

This stuff makes my hair smooth & the curls are more defined, but not hard. I absolutely love it. I still have a tiny bit of frizz but I’ve only been using a small amount. Just FYI I also use Shea Moisture JBCO shampoo, masks in place of conditioner, and leave in JCBO conditioner.

This stuff is fantastic. I have very dry, thick wavy/curly hair, and it gets weighted down and looks unhealthy. This custard leaves my hair soft and gives me defined curls to even the most stubborn strands of hair that just look frizzy. I've been applying it to wet hair, letting it dry for an hour, and then diffuse. I need to add just a tiny bit more after diffusing to tame flyaways, but that's it. I typically laugh at products that claim you need a quarter sized amount - that's such a load of garbage for anyone with longer, thick hair. But this stuff....you do not need a lot to go along way! This custard has replaced 2 other products that I no longer need in my routine. I'm super happy so far!!!!!!!!!"

To avoid the flake I apply this as soon as I shut off the shower, and before squeezing out my hair. After applying I scrunch out excess water. For all that, the end result is so-so.

I wish they made this is in a fragrance-free version. It somewhat holds my curls and reduces frizz so it could be three or four stars without the fragrance.

It does smell nice and hair feels soft. I mix equal-sized globs with Aussie gel and air dry to get a decent cast so the curls stay nice.

I've been trying the ""Curly girl"" method on my hair and this is one of the products that was recommended.  I use this on days that I skip shampoo. It provides that ""slippy"" feeling that helps separate curls without damaging but isn't very heavy on the moisturizing/conditioning.  I'll probably try a few others before I buy this one again."

I’m gonna give it 5 starts because of the quality of this product. Smells amazing and curls don’t get that crunchy appearance the other styling gels give. Curls go soft and defined. The product came leaking though, I guess due to the packaging and the rest of the items together in the box. I’d say order it separate."

When I opened the box and touched the product, it had leaked. The seal on the outside was in tact, but gross. Once I took that off, it was truly all over the outside of the container.

193,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",1.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced & drying,"I expected a larger tub but all I received was this tiny one, ridiculous for its price point. After letting that go, I tried it on my wet hair in the shower without gel and it did the opposite of what I was expecting, my hair just puffed up like there was no moisture in it. I tried it the second time the following week and put light gel over it and it weighed down everything. Do not get this product if you have high porosity 2a-3a hair, it is worthless and overpriced."
194,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",4.0 out of 5 stars,Holy grail product,"I love this stuff! I have fine 2b/2c hair and this works great. It doesn't weigh my hair down and a little goes a long way. However, I do use this under a gel. Neither one of the products gave enough hold alone, but provided the perfect amount of hold and definition together. The only thing I would complain about is the container. It's a pain to get the product out, especially when my head is flipped over in the shower."

It has the perfect hold that doesn't completely freeze your hair, but still holds. The only issue I have found is that if you aren't careful about evenly distributing this gel, it will clump up and dry into white crusty chunks in your hair. So just be sue to finger comb it through your hair very thoroughly before you scrunch it."

I tried to use it 3 different times. Each time it would burn my eyes when showering.

It's amazing! However, that's where my positive review stops. I've heard a lot of people rave about this product, but it just doesn't do much for my hair. The hold isn't strong enough for me to use it by itself, but I can never tell a difference when I use it with additional products. It's just not worth the money to me."

Smells great and makes my hair virtually frizz free. I took off one star just because it does have a tendency to weigh down my hair. I use just a small amount to top off my other styling products.

My only complaint is I’d rather it come in a tube or pump. I don’t like managing the container in the shower. Probably not an issue for others:)
249,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good,It helps curl at first but if you do anything it has like no hold unless you use a lot but then it leaves it dry with buildup. I have fine 2b-2c hair and it leaves it stringy and flat. I guess you can refresh the curls easy enough but have fun doing it every 30min.

If I use a diffuser my curls look great, not so much if I try to use it without it. My only complaint is it does leave white flakes.

This does not so it doesn't work if used alone for me. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I need the cast for my hair to hold up for 2nd or 3rd day hair. If it's too soft on 1st day hair, it wont hold up. HOWEVER, this product is still GREAT! It adds great definition to your curls and it is very forgiving if you use too much. If you like soft touch hold with defined curls, then this is for you. I actually combine it with another gel. I first use it on really damp hair as a ""primer"" and then finish off with the devacurl arc angel ultra hold gel. I don't have to use nearly as much devacurl gel and the combination of both products give me great definition. I will be purchasing it again."

I truly love it as a curl definer. My hair needs a bit more hold, i have 2C/3A fine hair so i add a bit of strong hold gell afterward. This really leaves curls defined and frizz free for the most part. I add a leave in light conditioner before Moptop custard and my day of curls come out really nice.I also love that this custard is free of silecones and other products that just sit on top of your hair. ++"

I have thin, porous hair, and this custard makes it pretty weighed down and icky. Though if I scrunch enough after it seems to look sort of OK.That being said, I think it could work really well for someone with thicker hair and a different curl texture. Instead, I'm just trying to use it up by applying to the bottom layer of my hair and using something else on the top. If you have curls like mine, I highly recommend AG Hair Cosmetics Curl Trigger Defining Spray. It's a little pricy but so great at forming curls without weighing them down."

The very first time I washed with this shampoo, I noticed that large sections of my scalp were covered in flaking skin. This was mostly an issue around my crown and forehead area. It was the strangest thing; the flaking would begin immediately after use (noticeable even under wet hair) and continue to get worse for the day or two after washing. After the hair dried, it would begin to itch and continue to get itchier as time passed. I'm not sure if it was just dry flaky skin or if it was actual dandruff, but the amount of whatever it was was astonishing (and gross).I stopped using the shampoo after about a week, and my problems stopped then, but I've used it a couple of times since (when I was desperate and out of other shampoos) and had the same problem. It's super weird but I haven't heard of anyone else having the same issue. Other than that, it smelled good and did a fine job washing my actual hair, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else experiences something similar."
784,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome so far!!,"I have been following the curly girl method for 5 months and have been experimenting with different products and different ways to apply them.  I received a sample of this custard and I love it so far! It made my 2C/3A curls even more curly!  I use a denman brush when I wash my hair, then I scrunch this into wet hair on top of homemade flax seed gel.  I only used a nickel sized amount on my thin hair which is just past my shoulders.  My curls were popping like never before!  It does have glycerin but it's winter now so it works great 4 me.  Not sure how well it will work in the humid summer because of the glycerin.I see some reviewers complained about this gel making their hair crunchy but keep in mind you're supposed to scrunch the hardness out of your hair in order to get soft curls.  Other reviewers complained of flaking but this wasn't an issue for me as i used on wet hair and did not mess with my curls after they dried and I ""scrunched out the crunch"".  Maybe ""scrunching out the crunch"" with some light oil would help with that?  Anyway, I give this stuff 2 thumbs up!"

It feels like that sugar body scrub you use.  I put some on my damp hair.  It will hold some of the curl in, but when it dries it turns hard like glue then starts to flake.  Compared to Ampro gel, which is much cheaper, I like Ampro better.  Ampro will smooth out my hair and make it straighter as it is holding it down.  Plus when it dries, it is not hard as glue, comes out easy and does not damage hair.  Ampro does very little flaking as well.  Back to that,"

I tried this several times and it was way too heavy for my hair. So, I got the idea of diluting a little with water, so that I could put it in a squeeze bottle and apply to my hair. It works great. My curls look as good with this product as any other curl enhancer that I have used.  I use a few pumps of deva curl ultra defining gel on top."

It doesn’t perform as well as I hoped. Compared to my other leave-ins which are the Kinky Curly Knot Today and the Shea Moisture silicone-free miracle treatment, it just doesn’t penetrate my hair strands as much and i gel it sort of sits on top of my hair. I also have to apply a lot of it to get any sort of effect. I don’t think I will be reaching for this product often."

But this one, man oh man! I am glad that I found this product!!!! I’ve always tried curly hair girl approved products , but they always weight down my curls and my hair gets super frizzy even though I diffuse. I don’t diffuse at all , so it would make me upset that even though I diffuse my hair would still get super frizzy! I would try so many methods and nothing! However, this product , I recently purchased the sample packets off their Instagram page. And I am so happy that I finally found a product that does justice to my hair!!!! Thank you, thank you!

794,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",3.0 out of 5 stars,not for soft texture,"I know many people love this product so I bought it to see how it goes. Turns out it wasn’t for me. I like no-crunch custard and this leaves my hair dry, frizzy and crunchy.  And if I put it in my hair a little too much, it leaves some white flakes. I live in East Asia so maybe the climate can be one of the reason why it’s not doing the work? Anyhow I would recommend this for someone who likes crunchy strong hold gel, but I wouldn’t personally buy it again."

I’ve used it twice so far and am just not impressed. It works okay... but it doesn’t have as much slip as I hoped so it’s hard to finger detangle my hair. It does clean my hair but I feel it is stripping away some moisture. When I compare it to the other Co-wash I own, which is the AS I AM Coconut cowash, it doesn’t perform as well."
796,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",2.0 out of 5 stars,This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely,"This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely, and helps keep the curl controlled as my hair dries.  Does not make my hair frizzy.  It smells nice, sweet like some kind of candy.  The reason for 2 stars is the bottle it comes in.  The product itself is pretty thick, like pudding.  It does not flow.  The plastic bottle it's in is thick hard plastic. It's ridiculously difficult to squeeze a thick, pudding-like product out of a narrow-necked stiff plastic bottle.  If you take the cap off you can ""shake"" it out, which is what I do, but it's not ideal considering that sometimes it shakes out a huge glob bigger than you need, which is a hassle again to scrape the excess back in.  The directions for use on the bottle state in bold letters, ""shake well"".  Lol, how do you shake this product well, especially when the bottle is brand new and filled to the top, and for what purpose?  Does the product separate as it sits it something.  No.  I just think there must be a lot of people in the company who don't understand the product or use it themselves.  The product would be better contained in a jar with a lid that you can dip your fingers into, or maybe a soft squeezable tube that can be stored upside down.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It doesn't seem like the manufacturer understands its own product. It's not exactly a bargain price either."

802,"MopTop Light Conditioner, Wavy, Loose Curls, Thin, Straight, Color Treated & Natural hair Moisturizer, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey reduces Frizz, increases Moisture & Manageability",4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprising Good!,"I bought these products after winning the travel sized kit and loving the daily conditioner.  I like the gentle shampoo because it cleaned my hair without stripping all the natural oils.  The deep conditioner didn't give me the same kind of slip for detangling as the the daily conditioner, but it did what it said it would do.  The leave it in conditioner gave my hair a light hold like a gel without the crunchy hardness of a gel.  It also left my hair soft and smooth.  I will for sure buy the leave it in conditioner and the gentle shampoo again.  I gave this review a 4 not 5 stars because the deep conditioner doesn't have the same slip as the daily conditioner.  The daily conditioner is the best conditioner for slip I have every used.  If you have frizzy curly hair these products are awesome.  It costs more, but these products are very high in and they work.  I have kinky curly hair and I love these products.  BTW it your hair is protein sensitive don't use the deep conditioner more then once a week."

My hair use to feel caked with product on the back of my head from other too moisturizing sulfate free shampoos. This one is perfect. I can also use the conditioner and leave in conditioner and even the custard without ever weighing my hair down. I've never been able to do that before. Pure magic"

I cannot understand why companies subject us to this?!  I should think the second main complaint (aside from the product not working as a person hopes to hold or relax as promised) is the smell.

I just ordered my second jar. I have fine, dense, 2B, medium porosity hair and this custard really helps my waves form, and it's pretty much foolproof. I've experimented with different amounts, but it never gets too gunky in my hair, never flakes, never weighs my hair down. For me it works best on wet, but not soaking wet hair, but everyone is different."

It’s simple with healthy ingredients, and does not flake. I use this on soaked hair. And drag it through my hair from root to tip and then scrunch my hair with a towel. I leave it to dry and then scrunch it later. It takes me 6months to go through one container, so you really don’t need a lot. My hair looks healthy, it has good hold, so I’m happy."

My hair is dry, frizzy, long, thick, and used to have springy curls but they are loosening to waves since I've been dyeing it. This is the ONLY thing I've tried (and I've tried sooooooo many products) that keeps my hair soft, tames the frizz, and encourages curls. There is a sweet smell but I'm highly sensitive to smells and it's never given me a headache and the scent doesn't last.I just twist it into my hair in sections, then shake them out and let it air dry."

After converting to being a curly girl I will forever have this product in my house. I have tried a few other products but they all made my hair look like it was wet all the time.

Based off of other reviews this stuff should have been a miracle. Our experience was more like a nightmare! After fully drying this stuff flakes uncontrollably. I tried several application methods and all resulted in a disgusting amount of flakes. Even with my daughter's hair pulled back and her not touching it. The hair of her ponytail rubbing against itself and the back of her shirt left flakes everywhere. Yuck!!!

I applied a generous amount of this product to a section of my hair last nite and my curls were still a bit crunchy. I thought that maybe I had product build up in my hair so I shampooed my hair today and re-applied a generous amount again to my entire hair and my curls were still a bit crunchy and stiff so I decided to ponytail my hair and leave a few strands out. This product smells amazing but didn’t give me the moist curls & softness as described. I’ll come back and give y’all an overall honest review once the entire bottle is done and I’ve sampled it on several styles.

The consistency is both thinner and a bit stickier than what I've been used to, but it's working for me just as well.  For context, my hair is naturally wavy/curly when short.  After washing I apply a small dab of leave-in conditioner, then use the custard, push into shape with my fingers and air dry.I have bits of hair on the side of my head that are a little stubborn with trying to curl the wrong direction and this holds them in place.  Which is good considering I've been resorting to at-home covid-cuts lol."

I heard about on from CurlyPenny on YouTube and she swears by this stuff. I was hoping for a MIRACLE product that would really make all my curls extra defined and absolutely no frizz, but it's not working perfectly on my hair type. My hair is suuuuper thick, coarse, and I have a lot of it. It's curly/wavy but I know some little curls are hidden in there! The best method I found for me was to bring it with me in the shower, and after I rinse my conditioner out with cold water, I put a generous amount of this in my hair with my head upside down with a crunching motion. Try it! All in all I do love it and I may buy it again once I run out, unless I find something even better!"

However, it has no preservatives in it and can actually “go bad” if it sits to long. I usually get it from my hair salon, but found it here on amazon and decided to order it. When it arrived, the tubs were wrapped in additional plastic (which is different from the salon) and the safety seal was missing. The thing that bothered me though was the color, consistency and smell of the product. It is supposed to smell wonderful (somewhat sweet but not overpowering) with a light opal color the consistency of thick honey. This was fowl smelling, runny and darker than it was supposed to be. Long story long, great product but buy it at a store so you can check it’s color!"

I have 2B, low porosity, fine-medium strands, high density hair. This custard smells great and is very concentrated, ensure you emulsify well when applying.  Custards don’t typically provide a lot of hold but I do think this product has a good amount of hold on its own. I typically use it on wash days but have used it to refresh and it will revive and hold my waves. Product smells great, citrusy like a Kumquat but the smell unfortunately will not linger (I personally would love to smell like this product all day long). The product does contain protein and glycerin. It has held up well even in humidity despite the glycerin content. This is likely because I DO layer this product with 2 other stylers that I think are a great combination and compliment each other superbly. I use the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curl Magic as a base, Moptop Curl Custard second, and seal the deal with Jessie Curl Spiralicious. In the pictures my hair looks wet/shiny, but it is fully dry FYI.In case you are wondering I use a cowash, As I Am 2 out of my 3 weekly wash days and clarify with Bounce Curl Clarifying Shampoo, and condition with Bounce Curl Super Smooth conditioner.I went crazy buying a bunch of products when I transitioned to embracing my natural hair, but hands down this product with the combination I mentioned above is a definite winner for my hair type. As you can see, I was so confident in my line-up that I went out to my first dressy outing sporting my natural hair for the first time since my transition and I was not disappointed. It gave me such confidence to know you can look “put together” with wavy/textured hair."

With moptop hair dries faster, I get better definition and glossy clumps. My hair is 2c, fine but dense, dry, heavily highlighted. I really get beautiful results. It is pretty forgiving, as if you use too much, you can easily scrunch out the cast and it won't weight your hair down a bit...this is another big difference with kinky curly...with my hair type it is pretty much impossible to get volume with kinky curly custard, but I get ton of body with lots of movement with moptop custard. The only con is the high content of glycerin that causes frizz in the super humid, high dew points days we have here in Florida. In those days, I can't usually use moptop by itself as a solo styler, but I need to top it with a hard hold-no/low glycerin gel (great with AG liquid effects, or Biosilk hard rock gelee). Not a big deal, I still get the good definition and bounciness moptop gives."

I have wavy frizzy hair and this left my hair with almost totally frizz free, soft, bouncy curls. It definitely has a funky slimy texture with a strong fruity citrus smell but the smell dissipates as it dries.Pros:Adds shineSoft not crunchy curlsLightweightNatural ingredientsAffordableCons:Tames most frizz but not allOverall I am pleased to have this on hand. It is a much better alternative to the unhealthy ingredients I got from my previous gel. Still looking for something natural to completely tame my frizz without looking like a grease ball.UPDATE: After a few months of use I found that if I use a little more on top where I'm most prone to get frizz it will make a slight cast that I can break after it dries and then I'm frizz free! I just pull the locks through my fingers to unstiffen it until it looks natural.I'm also so impressed with how much volume I get with this. It doesn't weigh down my hair even though I add extra on top. Updating my rating to 5 stars. I use it daily after showering or to refresh curls. I still have plenty left. I'd guess with my medium length hair it will last at least 6 months. Great natural product and value!"

I kept getting fuzzy, frizzy, stringy, undefined curls and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Turns out, aloe is a problem for a lot of curlies. If your hair is instantly frizzing and losing it's ""clumpage"" when you add this gel, consider that your hair might not like aloe. Look up flash-drying.I don't want to give this product a bad rating just because I didn't know aloe wouldn't work with my hair. After all, it seems to work well for lots of people! I just hope this review helps someone else who is struggling with this gel and can't figure out why."

   This stuff is my new go-to! Wish i found it sooner.I’ve never been quite sure what the difference between gel and custard/jelly is — there are so many different types of products out there! But in my experience I’ve found custards and jellys to clump my hair nicely but not necessarily define them, and I’ve found them to leave my hair looking a little greasy and leaving a weird residue on them, whereas I’ve found gels to define and hold hair much better, but often leave it crunchy with lots of flyaways. Also, gels hold seems to be too strong and leaves a lot of my waves/curls misshapen. This product has a unique texture, not 100% like either gel or jelly (see video)My hair ranges from ‘s’ wave patterns to curls (mostly underneath.) The top is prone to extreme frizziness and just general “poof” and the front pieces that frame my face are prone to losing all wave pattern. This product seems to address all my hair concerns: manages frizz, boosts curl patterns where it’s needed, and holds pretty well without leaving a weird greasy residue.Overall I’d say this product is the perfect medium between jelly and gel! More hold than a jelly but less crunch than a gel. It smells great too and i like that it comes in a jar. I use a leave in conditioner/curl cream first and then use this product to scrunch my hair, let it dry, and I’m good to go.Hope this product helps someone struggling with their hair as much as it helped me! For the price you can’t go wrong giving it a chance— I’m so glad i did :)"

Great for curly, frizzy, wavy hair in any humidity","This stuff is great! It smells slightly citrusy but not sweet, a little like baby aspirin, lol, but the smell is nice and is not strong. The texture is hard to describe - it is thick and maybe best described like ""slime"" but not slimy. It is thick and luxurious. You will only need a little to apply to your hair; I have long, thick hair, and I use about two quarter size blobs. Run through wet or damp hair and comb through, fluff your curls and then leave your hair alone. You will find that your curls are well defined, moist, and not frizzy at all. The product can be a little stiff, but if you shake your hair out, the stiffness goes away. There is absolutely no flaking at all with this product. I am also allergic to a lot of gels and mousses (the perfumes cause scalp problems), but I have no problems with this product at all. I'm picky with hair products, and I've tried a million of them. I will buy this one again!"

I have wavy 2b hair, and ever since using this product I've noticed such a change in its texture and shine. I can go longer between wash days, which in turn means my hair is looking a lot healthier and shinier. My main concern when first buying this was that it wouldn't lather as well or that my hair wouldn't be as clean and I am so happy I was wrong. The lather is a little less voluminous than your standard bottle of shampoo but it will still keep your hair very clean without making it feel like straw. Aside from all of this, a major highlight of this shampoo is the bamboo scent. I have been asked by three to four people about this shampoo because of the smell alone.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger size ( please make a 16 oz. version!!). Highly recommend!"

Liquids are too light and don't offer enough slip, and creams are too heavy and leave my waves/curls weighed down. This one is just right! It looks like a thick cream but it goes on very light. I apply it from my ears down and it leaves me with bouncy, moist curls. I adore the bamboo essence scent, which is very light and fresh with a slight citrus smell to it."

Along with Curly Girl advice, I have kept my thinning strands from frizzing (thanks Mother Nature) using that mousse and conditioning with every wash.  But I was curious to try a curly hair custard and, on a whim, bought this.  I am so glad I did. This holds my large spiral pattern as well as my old mousse, but my hair looks fuller, feels bouncier and softer.  Like there's nothing weighing it down. And on day 2, I can spritz my hair with water, scrunch, and it perks right up again.  Trying that with the Garnier left my hair looking a little flat and dirty.A small amount does the trick on my shoulder length bob, applied by scrunching it thru fairly wet strands and then carefully drying with a diffuser.  The citrus scent is nice.  The price no longer bothers me because that container is going to last me awhile and the results can't be beat.  Highly recommend!"

I had previously ordered a sample packet from moptop directly and LOVED the conditioner. I ordered through amazon because I had a credit on my account.

The real conditioner detangles my hair and has a great slip to it, what I received doesn’t help detangle at all. Super disappointed."

It lathers up quite a bit!  I use it several times a week. I follow the curly girl method but  I found that co-washing is just way too much oil for my fine 2B waves so I use this shampoo (and moptop's light conditioner).

But my curls just aren’t as full and I would have to completely re-do my hair daily if I didn’t want to just shove it in a bun. You know what I mean- totally wet it, work in fresh product, diffuse.....I have enough hair that that gets annoying.BUT with Mop Top I get out of the shower on day one and split my wet hair down the middle, over my shoulders, take a very small scoop of the goo and twist and finger brush it through each section. Then I flip my head, scrunch my hair and diffuse.I have noticed that a tiny bit of product goes a long way and it can get crunchy, but I solve that by just rolling my curls between my hands in sections to loosen the crunch and it’s perfect!Then, my favorite part about this product:I don’t wash my hair every day when I shower. I may go 3-4 days no wash. But like I said with my previous product: I would have to re-do the entire curly process if I wanted my hair done daily. NOT with Mop Top. A few sprays with a water bottle to reform the bed head (not even enough worth diffuse drying) and boom! My hair looks like day one! For all three days! No extra product! I love it!This tub of goo will last forever!The photo I’m posting is day THREE!"

It foams up great and the bamboo essence scent is divine (it's a fresh, light scent with a hint of citrus). It cleans thoroughly, but like all sulfate free shampoos, there are some tricks to helping it clean properly. You must use LOTS of water...add more water, not more product, if you feel like you need more cleaning power. Also, let it sit just a bit longer than regular shampoo. After that it will leave your hair squeaky clean, with no scalp irritation from harsh sulfates. It does not dry my hair out."

I have tried so many products so when I came across this stuff I was like Yes! I need to try it. Well the first time I applied it I didn't seem to put enough in my hair (it doesn't state how much to put in your hair so it's trial and error I guess). Before I used it the next time I searched You Tube I found the creators page and watched how she applied it. Well she put on tons it seemed. My hair is about 3 inches shorter and so I tried to adjust the amount. My hair came out crunchy and nothing like hers. Then later that night my hair looked like I had dandruff and my head itched the rest of the night. I should have washed my hair that night because my scalp itched all night. I got up first thing and washed my hair really good but it still itched. I don't think I'll try it again for that reason. I can't stand my scalp itching!

I take sections of my hair and mix together a cream and Jessicurl Spiralicious, apply to hair, and then I apply Mop Top. I brush each section with a Denman brush and smooth each section to encourage clumping. Then I scrunch the hell out of it and fix the wonky curls. I do that to every section and then diffuse until about 80% dry, and let air dry the rest of the way. I've used the rest of my products with a different gel, and definitely love the MopTop results better every time."

I don't have to use that much either, so this will last a good amount of time.  I do only wash twice a week though.  I just wish this wasn't so expensive, but I am willing to pay this being as it is so hard for me to find the right styling products for my hair!!UPDATE:  This worked great in the winter months but not doing all that good in the summer being as it has glycerin in this.

That is when I discovered that I have low porosity hair, and that the Deva curl gel is full of protein, which is not good for low porosity hair So, I went looking for something with minimal protein and found the Mop Top curly hair custard. I wasn't expecting much, because there are no curl holding chemicals in this gel, but I was very surprised to see that my hair was both fluffy and curly after just one little scoop (3 fingers) of gel. With Mop Top, less is more, so you don't need much. To refresh second day curls, just put a dash of gel and leave in conditioner in a small spray bottle with water. Spray and scrunch, and your curls will hold another day or two, even on fine hair. What I like the most is that this product never weighs down your hair. And it smells citrusy, which I like a lot."

Then I tried a MopTop sample kit and loved this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has the perfect consistency - not too thick but not too watery. For a low-poo it sudses up amazingly, and is easy to scrub into my scalp. I can tell it doesn't cleanse my scalp as well as my clarifying shampoo, but that is to be expected. I will use it 3 out of 4 washes to encourage the natural oils in my hair. It has a great balance of protein vs. moisture. And best of all is the scent - I didn't know bamboo could smell so good! It is an addicting sweet/fresh scent that makes me really look forward to wash days. Which says a lot, as I am usually very sensitive to fragrances and there are many hair products I have to toss because the scents really bother me. I'm loving my journey with MopTop!"

I use a minuscule amount, spread around in my hands and just wash roots. Works well for my mid length dry at ends but easily greasy roots - hair 👌🏼"

I didn't notice a difference at first, but now that I've experimented with a lot of different products, this one is still part of my wash day routine. I add this right after leave-in and just before I apply a hard cast gel; I can literally feel it sucking the water into the core of my strands, and it takes my hair from dripping to just saturated with one application. Once all three products are applied, I throw my hair up into a microfiber turban until I can diffuse (for anyone that was curious about my post-wash routine). Hope this helps other low-porosity curlies out there!"

Deva is great, but it's really expensive, plus you should change up your product occasionally to give your hair a rest.I shopped around, checked reviews, even tried some samples of a few brands, and MopTop products won the race by a mile! I'm currently using the no-poo cleansing conditioner, the daily conditioner, the leave-in conditioner, and the Curly Hair Custard. The custard was my first purchase and came with some samples from the rest of the line.I will say it works much better with a little extra moisture underneath. After conditioning (or cleansing and conditioning if it's ""wash"" day) I apply a tiny bit of the leave-in while still in the shower with SOAKING wet hair. Then I step out and apply a liberal amount of the Curly Custard, being sure to flip upside-down and side-to-side. Then scrunch scrunch scrunch. I let it air dry then loosen the cast once it's completely dry. This can also be done with a diffuser, but I don't have time for blow dryers. I find I see a lot more frizz if I skip the leave-in."

Didn't provide any better results than lesser expensive products I can buy at my local retail outlet. I bought this because it is natural and minus the sulfates, which can dry out and damage hair and scalp. My scalp has been dry for some time and I have psoriasis, which does flare up from time to time., especially when my scalp is dry. I also changed shampoos at the same time, using a cleansing conditoner free of sulfates.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't really made a difference. Additonally, it tends to create a slightly crispy texture in my hair.  This will probably not be the experience for most people as I have very, very kinky, frizzy curly hair. Although each folicle is very fine, I have a lot of it, and WITH the extreme curl, it often feels almost coarse.I am Scotch Irish and just have crazier hair than most people here buying this product. However, if you share my genetic predisposition, please understand that this may not work for you either.That all being said, the product came well packaged and smells really nice. And I do like that it is natural. *sigh*"

Research suggested that hair similar to mine benefits most from lightweight, moisturizing products. I ended up focusing more on using a lower number of moisturizing products instead of multiple lightweight products. I've used As I Am Leave In Conditioner for my dry hair since before I started this hair journey but decided to ditch it if I'm going to add on a curl activator/enhancer/gel. I tried Cantu Curl Activator, which did almost nothing to define my waves and made my hair more frizzy. I tried Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie which did help enhance my waves (not in the back though), provided decent moisture, reduced some frizz, but did not have much hold- next day waves were basically not a thing and frizz was back. Adding in Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel gave me almost no hold (Upon purchasing I didn't realize it was a light hold gel) and was very drying so I ditched that quickly and replaced it with Eco Style Gel (strong hold gel). It did help with definition and hold all around, not drying, but it wasn't optimal. I moved on to Aunt Jackie's Defining Curl Custard and no gel which impressed me with the moisture, decent hold, reduced frizz, and enhanced definition even in the 2A back of my hair- but it contains silicones that I knew would eventually weigh down my hair. Mop Top Curly Hair Custard Gel had been on my list of CGM approved products to try and I should've gone with it ages ago because this product goes beyond Aunt Jackie's. I have defined waves all around, equal hold, and it is moisturizing. I've gotten the best defined next day waves compared to all other products I've tried. With other/no products, my halo frizz is usually worse the second and third day- but even with humectants being predominant in this product, I have had no halo frizz. I usually get frizz in both dry and humid environments, I have not yet had a chance to test it on a sufficiently humid day. I am optimistic though."

Finally a good hair curl product!!!,"When I was younger I had super straight hair.  Seriously!  Sometimes I had to perm it twice (it was the 80's when spiral perms were ""in"") just to get the curls to stick.  Over the years my hair has evolved and it has slowly developed major frizz.  However, recently I've discovered that when tamed, that frizz is actually waves/curls!  I've purchased some creams and mousses recently to make the most out of my curls, but all of the products I've tried have always resulted in tacky-to-the-touch, frizzy and crunchy stiff hair.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos and some of the ladies raved about this product and their curls did look lovely so I thought I'd by a jar and give it a try.  My jar arrived today and tonight I tried it.  It's AMAZING!!!  I towel dried my hair and applied this product to my damp hair.  This ""custard"" is runny but a little goes a long way so it didn't take much to cover my thin/fine hair.  I loved that it wasn't tacky and cause my hair to stick to my hand when I applied it.  I let my hair air-dry and I was happy to see that every time I checked on it, my curls were curling and there wasn't any frizz in sight!  When my hair was about  75% dry, I decided to defuse it and really give it the frizz test.  Once again... no frizz and my curls were even more prominent!  I've been disappointed by so many products over the years so I am so incredibly happy to find a hair product that surpassed my expectations!  I'm new to MopTop hair products but I'll definitely be giving other MopTop products a try in the future.I highly recommend this product."

Thankfully Kinky Curly was out of stock. I washed my hair and applied Moptop and went outside in the hot sun and did yardwork. Sweating profusely. Most of my hair dried though! I pulled and stretched out the curls and still have good definition. Going out for a walk with temp still 86f. Will see how good of a hold I keep. That is always a challenge for me though.

However the contents of the container appear to be in good condition.Performance: nice texture to the gel, applies easily, smells good, dries relatively quickly. Decent amount of hold but more difficult to completely break the cast than Kinky Curly custard. Does have a lot of glycerin in it so it is not good in the summer humidity. My normally minimally frizzy 2b wavy hair looked poodle-esk after only a few minutes out air conditioning. I also had some white flaking as it apparently interacts with Miss Jessie’s  curl cream.Overall it’s an okay purchase if it’s not humid outside and I’m in a hurry to leave the house with dry hair. I think it will be more of a winter product and will update back."

I use it on my daughter who has very curly hair and it works well to get all of the days messes out of her hair although I must follow up with a deep conditioner

Everything else has too much protein, or too much oil for my hair, leaving it dry and brittle. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it. This moisturizes very well, but never leaves my hair weighed down or greasy. It actually gets into my hair shaft, rather then just sitting on top! I have tried so many conditioners, and can not handle chemical smells. This is scented with citrus essenial oils, and the smell does not linger. It is also a very pure, natural product, which is very important to me. I am very grateful to mop top for making such a wonderful product. If not for this, my poor hair would be dry as a dessert. Don't ever stop making it!"

It burns when you wash hair. And then a day later I got an unbearable sharp pain in my eyes that I could not open them because it felt like knife is cutting right through them. It took me a few episodes to understand what was causing that pain a day later after the wash. Stopped using a product and the pain did not come back. Never buying any of Moptop products again!

Frankly, this would probably be my favorite product of all time if it weren't for the sickly-sweet and overpowering scent that just reminds me of cheap sugary products. I don't smell the ""citrus"" at all. I used it this morning and although the scent has faded over time, my headache that came from it is still lingering. If there's an unscented version of this product, I'd jump on it without hesitation. As is, though, I wouldn't buy it again."

Used this tonight for the first time during squish to condish, after applying a leave in. I used maybe 3 quarter sizes worth of product and I did not use any gel, because after reading the reviews I was really curious to see what it would do on its own. It did create a *little bit* of a cast.My hair looks great, however next time I'll use a little more product and see what happens. And then I'll try a bit of gel with it, and report back. So far I am very happy with this product."

Please Read,"I tried to give this product the benefit of the doubt. I even tried it for a full 3 months. However, the smell and quality is absolutely horrendous. If you like smelling like candied coconut mixed with playdough...you'll love this scent! I had to spray hairspray or perfume on my head anytime I conditioned with this. Not only that, it left the most residue and buildup in my hair I've ever had. Let me remind you, I used this for 3 months, not changing any other products and this conditioner made my hair greasy, stringy, and smelling like a literal child covered in playdough. Honestly, the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life."

Her hair is fairly wavy but before Mop Top it just looked messy so I always put it up in pony tails.  I got recommended a bunch of products but was looking for a more affordable option for my 4 year old.  I really like this stuff.  It smells great (so good that I use it in my hair to keep down my fly always because of the nice scent!).  It helps define her curls in the morning.  We hair wash at night, so by morning her hair is just a wavy bed head mess.  All I really need is this Mop Top stuff, although sometimes I do a detangler or mousse.  But I've found Mop Top is all I really need to make her hair presentable to wear curly."

I hate stuff that leaves my hair feeling dirty or heavy! I'm so glad I took the leap! I made my mom try it (who never does anything with her hair) and it made her hair so much healthier looking... and brought the curls out so nicely! My niece, who is mixed, tried it... and she loved it as well! So pretty much... it doesn't matter how curly your hair is, or what nationality you are... try this! No regrets!"

I've tried other custards and a flaxseed gel with the same consistency and it just isn't my thing. I have fine hair, and used this at the beginning of my CG transistion, so it was kind of a 2a-2b wave. The product was nice for a wash-and-wear, one product look. It also smells like Sprite to me, which is a pleasant and not over powering smell. Unlike some custards, it didn't make my hair look stringy if I used a little too much. I gave what I had left to a friend with coarser, 3b-3c hair and she likes it as a wash-and-wear as well."

I really like it for both of our hair. It actually leaves my daughter's fine hair kind of plumped. If you leave it in awhile, it deeply moisturizes and feels almost like buttery smooth. Yet still is so light, unlike butters and oils that weigh hair down.  It's keeping my 2B waves much more bouncy as oppose to some of the heavier butter like cowashing I did in the past.  I plan to use this for my daily conditioner."

I chose this because it was recommended by the CGM website for those with long 2A hair. It rinses well where I do not have to stand long in the shower just to rinse it off. It makes my hair really shiny without being weighed down. I wish this came in a bigger bottle with a pump.

I do!,"I went for a perm, but my stylist talked me or of it-she said I had volume and waves, I just needed the right cut and products. She added some layers and sold me some shampoo, and I bought some Mop Top, after reading reviews. After about a month of using this product, plus avoiding straightening, I actually have a head full of bouncy waves! The scent dries fresh and mild, it doesn't leave hair crunchy, and it spreads lightly and evenly.  I recommend trying it, and I will be purchasing more!"

I’m a loyal Deva Curl user for many years but my curly hair is getting looser the older I get, and a good product is needed more than ever to alleviate frizz and define curl. The smell is a mild citrus, very tolerable, and the texture appears water soluble and blended well into my damp hair. No residue and dried slightly crisp which I could somewhat shake out. However I prefer a stronger hold, especially as the day wears on in humidity. The key is to leave your hair alone when you apply product and that’s always a challenge. With Deva, I combine several different products to get good hold. This one does it all by itself. I’m very pleased so far."

The internet made me buy it—specifically, the real life curly girl on YouTube. I have wavy (2b if you follow curly girl method) hair that is long, medium density, medium thickness, and pretty porous (colored). This product is not heavy, is not crunchy, and provides some volume with zero frizz. It can be used on its own for curl and medium hold or under a gel as just a curl activator. New holy grail—I keep trying other things, and they don’t come close. I was not paid for this review."

This stuff helps my waves hold moisture, they clump beautifully, they last 3 days (with minimal refresh), and I can use it alone if I'm in a rush.

HOWEVER, the smell is overwhelming and never goes away.  It's bad enough to give me a headache.  I have eczema and I'm pretty sure if I use it too often, it'll end up making it flare up so I don't recommend this if you have eczema or asthma or are otherwise sensitive to scents.For now, I'm using homemade flaxseed gel and just layering a small amount of this over it.  I really wish MopTop would make an unscented version or just not dump an entire vat of fragrance into their otherwise wonderful product."

I'm still experimenting with it, so we'll see. But I also had to knock some points off because the overwhelming stink of lemon pledge!

A little bit of this goes a long way and you really don't need to use more than a nickel to quarter size amount depending on how much hair you have.

Amazon was sold out of my usual gel last time, so I ordered this instead. It does an okay job holding curls together (similar to other nice gels I've tried) and only causes a moderate amount of ""crispiness"" in areas where you apply too much. The thing that I can't stand about this gel is the horrible smell! It smells like chemicals to me. I even had my boyfriend comment on the weird smell when my hair was wet. Trying to make myself use at least half of the container, but can't wait to throw this stuff out."

I have fine, low-medium density, high porosity, 2C waves. The conditioner is light weight, but moisturizes like a heavy deep conditioner. And it has GREAT slip. My hair is incredibly tangly, and almost impossible to finger detangle when wet. This is the only conditioner I’ve tried that allows me to finger detangle without feeling like I’m ripping my hair out. My hair loves this product!"

Waste of money.,"I have fine curly hair, ringlets. I used this shampoo combined with the Moptop Leave in conditioner (which didn't condition) and then the Moptop Curly Custard, and my hair feels like straw, is ridiculously frizzy, and was harmed by these products. The curly custard is the only one that gave ANY moisture. The leave-in conditioner, was worse than the shampoo. Don't waste your money on these products, they hurt my hair."

A lot of products for curly hair are too heavy for me. Today was the first day I've used this curly hair custard and I am IMPRESSED. It creates a really strong cast, but once I scrunched out the crunch my curls were soft and defined unlike anything I've experienced before. Since this is the first time using it and I'm only about 2 hours into my day, I will hold off on official judgment until the end of the day, but so far this is my first holy grail product."

It's not quite a defining gel,  but a product that will ""encourage"" waves into curls.The best way to use it is right after washing your hair, scrunching upwards.  The custard alone won't prevent frizz.  You still need to use gel.  I see some reviews that complain about a white residue, if you get that,  you're applying too much custard.I love the citrusy scent and how shiny my hair looks when it dries."

However it is NOT great for fine curls. I've been looking everywhere for a good gel for fine curls, and this did say that it was in the description, but it isn't. It left my hair sticky and stringy and with frizz and fly-aways for days. Also, no matter how little I used, there was no scrunching out the crunch. It just stayed crunchy even after diffusing. I'm sure it works well for other hair types, but not fine hair."

My only complaint is that the amount is 8oz, and I wish I could find it in a 12 or 16 oz container bc I must use a lotttttttt of it. I use a hard hold over it bc it doesn't give me a ton of hold, but I always have to use a gel on top of any styler. Gel alone doesn't give me the definition I desire. THIS does!!! Highly recommend!!"

It's my favorite gel for my 3a(ish) hair. I use it in combination with a curl cream, because my hair is thick and needs a lot of moisture, but this product can be a one-step curl routine for finer hair. I like it better than Deva Curl gel. It has better hold and does some special slip action that is very moisturizing and unique to the product. I also like the way it sculpts my curls a little bit more than the Deva gels. I love the definition I get from this product. Although you use a generous amount, I wouldn't load it on too thick, because it is fairly strong. You need to be kind of sparing when reapplying on second day hair--I would recommend not reapplying to the whole head. My only criticism is that it can create slightly more buildup than other lighter gels, like Deva. The smell is citrusy and lovely. The ingredients are VERY clean. Buy, buy, buy."

I start with a generous amount of this, and then top with Jessicurl Spiralicious. By far the best my naturally wavy hair has ever looked! This combo keeps my hair looking great for 2 - 3 days, without refreshing. I'm just sorry that I didn't try this sooner."

I can’t speak to the effectiveness of these products because I couldn’t get past the very strong smells. I’m not usually super sensitive to smells, but these were so strongly scented that I couldn’t bear to use them! Many of the places I go are requireing that no scent be used and this would keep me from being able to go to those places. Bummer."

The product arrived sealed in clear plastic, however, the inner safety disk was partially missing. It seems to have dissolved into the product — see the photo. The scent is a very strong citrus smell. It is too strong for my liking and immediately irritated my eyes. Product has an expiration date of 09/21. This is not a keeper and must be returned."

I still have a tiny bit of ...,"My hair is soft, less frizzy, and not weighed down too much. I have a lot of thick wavy/curly hair. I think it’s 2c/3a. Anyway, my problem is frizz. This stuff makes my hair smooth & the curls are more defined, but not hard. I absolutely love it. I still have a tiny bit of frizz but I’ve only been using a small amount. Just FYI I also use Shea Moisture JBCO shampoo, masks in place of conditioner, and leave in JCBO conditioner. So those are to thank as well but still, I could definitely tell a difference after using this. Love love love."

I found this very flakey once it dried and I scrunched. It also left my loose fine curls very piecey and divided (not clumped and full). Not the right product for me.

My hair is black, so although the flaking is only in certain places where too much product sat on my hair, it's still embarrassingly visible. I've tried to use less, but then there's no hold.-Expensive compared to other gels.-Arrived with seal broken and lid barely screwed on. Gross & unprofessional.Pros:-Good light hold for my 2c waves. Easy to scrunch out the crunch without creating frizz."

Trying out this curly girl thing and still in the transition phase.  My hair is fine, dense 2b waves and it is pretty oily.  Could not comprehend the idea of co-washing considering the oil levels in my hair.  I can use this and I feel clean after."

I followed the instructions, applied it to sopping wet hair, and it created nothing but a scraggly, crunchy look. I was really hoping this would work on my hair but it failed to impress."

This is it! It doesn’t build up either it’s amazing. I never thought I’d Gina a replacement for Catwalk Curls Rock Curl Amplifier but this is it and it’s not sticky like the curl amplifier. I’m in love with this product.

This stuff is fantastic. I have very dry, thick wavy/curly hair, and it gets weighted down and looks unhealthy. This custard leaves my hair soft and gives me defined curls to even the most stubborn strands of hair that just look frizzy. I've been applying it to wet hair, letting it dry for an hour, and then diffuse. I need to add just a tiny bit more after diffusing to tame flyaways, but that's it. I typically laugh at products that claim you need a quarter sized amount - that's such a load of garbage for anyone with longer, thick hair. But this stuff....you do not need a lot to go along way! This custard has replaced 2 other products that I no longer need in my routine. I'm super happy so far!!!!!!!!!"

I want something that will take all products out of my hair, except my color.  This product did not clean my hair as I want, and did take out some color.  My roots were worse after."

I ended up getting tangles in my hair while washing it and had to put in a deep conditioner afterwards and gently comb them out. And I washed my hair with this a second time just to make sure it wasn’t a fluke. It wasn’t.

To avoid the flake I apply this as soon as I shut off the shower, and before squeezing out my hair. After applying I scrunch out excess water. For all that, the end result is so-so. Not much hold even though it makes your hair pretty crunchy. And if you scrunch the crunch, you might get flakes."

You need to use a small amount,This product is great.  I’ve used it a few times now and it works great.  You need only a small amount.  I’ve read other reviews that it flakes.  I’m only assuming they are using too much.  I’m usually wearing something black and I’ve not noticed any flakes at all.

This left my hair in little spiky stiff curls that looked messy not the sleek twirls I get with other products.  I do like the scent, but it just doesn't work as well as I'd hoped and I won't order again.  It's also very hard to use in the tub.  A pump would be a much better fit for this product."

It has a pleasant candy-like smell, and it makes my hair feel super silky when it's applied. It's lightweight and makes my hair feel so silky and soft after a use. However, just a warning, if you apply it to your scalp and do not wash it out all the way with cold water as instructed, it might stick to the scalp and cause some unwanted dandruff."

I LOVE THIS. hands down my new favorite styling product. it leaves a little bit of a cast when my hair dries but i scrunch my hair out anyways whenever it’s dry so it’s not a problem for me. i love the results this gave me & it smells really good too!"

I don't know how this would be moisturizing enough for any curlies. I have fine curls and this did not adequately detangle or condition, let alone leave me with lovely curls. On the contrary, it left hair undefined and dry and scalp slightly itchy, which is unusual for me."

I wish they made this is in a fragrance-free version. It somewhat holds my curls and reduces frizz so it could be three or four stars without the fragrance.

I've been trying the ""Curly girl"" method on my hair and this is one of the products that was recommended.  I use this on days that I skip shampoo. It provides that ""slippy"" feeling that helps separate curls without damaging but isn't very heavy on the moisturizing/conditioning.  I'll probably try a few others before I buy this one again."

I’m gonna give it 5 starts because of the quality of this product. Smells amazing and curls don’t get that crunchy appearance the other styling gels give. Curls go soft and defined. The product came leaking though, I guess due to the packaging and the rest of the items together in the box. I’d say order it separate."

When I opened the box and touched the product, it had leaked. The seal on the outside was in tact, but gross. Once I took that off, it was truly all over the outside of the container.

After letting that go, I tried it on my wet hair in the shower without gel and it did the opposite of what I was expecting, my hair just puffed up like there was no moisture in it. I tried it the second time the following week and put light gel over it and it weighed down everything. Do not get this product if you have high porosity 2a-3a hair, it is worthless and overpriced."

I have fine 2b/2c hair and this works great. It doesn't weigh my hair down and a little goes a long way. However, I do use this under a gel. Neither one of the products gave enough hold alone, but provided the perfect amount of hold and definition together. The only thing I would complain about is the container. It's a pain to get the product out, especially when my head is flipped over in the shower."

It has the perfect hold that doesn't completely freeze your hair, but still holds. The only issue I have found is that if you aren't careful about evenly distributing this gel, it will clump up and dry into white crusty chunks in your hair. So just be sue to finger comb it through your hair very thoroughly before you scrunch it."

It's amazing! However, that's where my positive review stops. I've heard a lot of people rave about this product, but it just doesn't do much for my hair. The hold isn't strong enough for me to use it by itself, but I can never tell a difference when I use it with additional products. It's just not worth the money to me."

Smells great and makes my hair virtually frizz free. I took off one star just because it does have a tendency to weigh down my hair. I use just a small amount to top off my other styling products. That being said, this will last for quite a while because I have to use such a small amount. (I have pretty thin hair, typically a mix of 2c/3a.)"

This does not so it doesn't work if used alone for me. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I need the cast for my hair to hold up for 2nd or 3rd day hair. If it's too soft on 1st day hair, it wont hold up. HOWEVER, this product is still GREAT! It adds great definition to your curls and it is very forgiving if you use too much. If you like soft touch hold with defined curls, then this is for you. I actually combine it with another gel. I first use it on really damp hair as a ""primer"" and then finish off with the devacurl arc angel ultra hold gel. I don't have to use nearly as much devacurl gel and the combination of both products give me great definition. I will be purchasing it again."

I truly love it as a curl definer. My hair needs a bit more hold, i have 2C/3A fine hair so i add a bit of strong hold gell afterward. This really leaves curls defined and frizz free for the most part. I add a leave in light conditioner before Moptop custard and my day of curls come out really nice.I also love that this custard is free of silecones and other products that just sit on top of your hair. ++"

I have thin, porous hair, and this custard makes it pretty weighed down and icky. Though if I scrunch enough after it seems to look sort of OK.That being said, I think it could work really well for someone with thicker hair and a different curl texture. Instead, I'm just trying to use it up by applying to the bottom layer of my hair and using something else on the top. If you have curls like mine, I highly recommend AG Hair Cosmetics Curl Trigger Defining Spray. It's a little pricy but so great at forming curls without weighing them down."

The very first time I washed with this shampoo, I noticed that large sections of my scalp were covered in flaking skin. This was mostly an issue around my crown and forehead area. It was the strangest thing; the flaking would begin immediately after use (noticeable even under wet hair) and continue to get worse for the day or two after washing. After the hair dried, it would begin to itch and continue to get itchier as time passed. I'm not sure if it was just dry flaky skin or if it was actual dandruff, but the amount of whatever it was was astonishing (and gross).I stopped using the shampoo after about a week, and my problems stopped then, but I've used it a couple of times since (when I was desperate and out of other shampoos) and had the same problem. It's super weird but I haven't heard of anyone else having the same issue. Other than that, it smelled good and did a fine job washing my actual hair, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else experiences something similar."

I received a sample of this custard and I love it so far! It made my 2C/3A curls even more curly!  I use a denman brush when I wash my hair, then I scrunch this into wet hair on top of homemade flax seed gel.  I only used a nickel sized amount on my thin hair which is just past my shoulders.  My curls were popping like never before!  It does have glycerin but it's winter now so it works great 4 me.  Not sure how well it will work in the humid summer because of the glycerin.I see some reviewers complained about this gel making their hair crunchy but keep in mind you're supposed to scrunch the hardness out of your hair in order to get soft curls.  Other reviewers complained of flaking but this wasn't an issue for me as i used on wet hair and did not mess with my curls after they dried and I ""scrunched out the crunch"".  Maybe ""scrunching out the crunch"" with some light oil would help with that?  Anyway, I give this stuff 2 thumbs up!"

It feels like that sugar body scrub you use.  I put some on my damp hair.  It will hold some of the curl in, but when it dries it turns hard like glue then starts to flake.  Compared to Ampro gel, which is much cheaper, I like Ampro better.  Ampro will smooth out my hair and make it straighter as it is holding it down.  Plus when it dries, it is not hard as glue, comes out easy and does not damage hair.  Ampro does very little flaking as well.  Back to that,"

Turns out it wasn’t for me. I like no-crunch custard and this leaves my hair dry, frizzy and crunchy.  And if I put it in my hair a little too much, it leaves some white flakes. I live in East Asia so maybe the climate can be one of the reason why it’s not doing the work?

It glides through my curly hair nicely,"This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely, and helps keep the curl controlled as my hair dries.  Does not make my hair frizzy.  It smells nice, sweet like some kind of candy.  The reason for 2 stars is the bottle it comes in.  The product itself is pretty thick, like pudding.  It does not flow.  The plastic bottle it's in is thick hard plastic. It's ridiculously difficult to squeeze a thick, pudding-like product out of a narrow-necked stiff plastic bottle.  If you take the cap off you can ""shake"" it out, which is what I do, but it's not ideal considering that sometimes it shakes out a huge glob bigger than you need, which is a hassle again to scrape the excess back in.  The directions for use on the bottle state in bold letters, ""shake well"".  Lol, how do you shake this product well, especially when the bottle is brand new and filled to the top, and for what purpose?  Does the product separate as it sits it something.  No.  I just think there must be a lot of people in the company who don't understand the product or use it themselves.  The product would be better contained in a jar with a lid that you can dip your fingers into, or maybe a soft squeezable tube that can be stored upside down.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It doesn't seem like the manufacturer understands its own product. It's not exactly a bargain price either."

I have thick, dense naturally wavy/spiral curls & this product has changed my entire haircare routine. My very first wash n go without frizz & needing to stretch my curls. I finished with the Mop Top Mongongo Oil. Both products will actually save me money since I don't have to put together a cocktail for proper curl definition, hold with moisture. I rarely write reviews. This one was a must. Follow the directions on the product labels & you'll be impressed."

However, for my thick, frizzy 2B hair, this custard totally weighed down my hair. It didn't even work like a gel — no definition, no crunch. My hair was flatter than ever. However, it was very moisturizing and totally got rid of frizz. Can't use it personally, however!"

I like the gentle shampoo because it cleaned my hair without stripping all the natural oils.  The deep conditioner didn't give me the same kind of slip for detangling as the the daily conditioner, but it did what it said it would do.  The leave it in conditioner gave my hair a light hold like a gel without the crunchy hardness of a gel.  It also left my hair soft and smooth.  I will for sure buy the leave it in conditioner and the gentle shampoo again.  I gave this review a 4 not 5 stars because the deep conditioner doesn't have the same slip as the daily conditioner.  The daily conditioner is the best conditioner for slip I have every used.  If you have frizzy curly hair these products are awesome.  It costs more, but these products are very high in and they work.  I have kinky curly hair and I love these products.  BTW it your hair is protein sensitive don't use the deep conditioner more then once a week."

Based off of other reviews this stuff should have been a miracle. Our experience was more like a nightmare! After fully drying this stuff flakes uncontrollably.

The hair of her ponytail rubbing against itself and the back of her shirt left flakes everywhere. Yuck!!!

I applied a generous amount of this product to a section of my hair last nite and my curls were still a bit crunchy. I thought that maybe I had product build up in my hair so I shampooed my hair today and re-applied a generous amount again to my entire hair and my curls were still a bit crunchy and stiff so I decided to ponytail my hair and leave a few strands out. This product smells amazing but didn’t give me the moist curls & softness as described. I’ll come back and give y’all an overall honest review once the entire bottle is done and I’ve sampled it on several styles.

The consistency is both thinner and a bit stickier than what I've been used to, but it's working for me just as well.  For context, my hair is naturally wavy/curly when short.  After washing I apply a small dab of leave-in conditioner, then use the custard, push into shape with my fingers and air dry.I have bits of hair on the side of my head that are a little stubborn with trying to curl the wrong direction and this holds them in place.

I have 2b hair that tends to get frizzy yet somehow flat. Many products for curly hair are too heavy for me and volumizing products make my hair look like straw.

The best method I found for me was to bring it with me in the shower, and after I rinse my conditioner out with cold water, I put a generous amount of this in my hair with my head upside down with a crunching motion. Try it! All in all I do love it and I may buy it again once I run out, unless I find something even better!"

However, it has no preservatives in it and can actually “go bad” if it sits to long. I usually get it from my hair salon, but found it here on amazon and decided to order it. When it arrived, the tubs were wrapped in additional plastic (which is different from the salon) and the safety seal was missing. The thing that bothered me though was the color, consistency and smell of the product. It is supposed to smell wonderful (somewhat sweet but not overpowering) with a light opal color the consistency of thick honey. This was fowl smelling, runny and darker than it was supposed to be. Long story long, great product but buy it at a store so you can check it’s color!"
1,"﻿MopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Staple product, consistent results.","This is one of my staple products. I have 2B, low porosity, fine-medium strands, high density hair. This custard smells great and is very concentrated, ensure you emulsify well when applying.  Custards don’t typically provide a lot of hold but I do think this product has a good amount of hold on its own. I typically use it on wash days but have used it to refresh and it will revive and hold my waves. Product smells great, citrusy like a Kumquat but the smell unfortunately will not linger (I personally would love to smell like this product all day long). The product does contain protein and glycerin. It has held up well even in humidity despite the glycerin content. This is likely because I DO layer this product with 2 other stylers that I think are a great combination and compliment each other superbly. I use the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curl Magic as a base, Moptop Curl Custard second, and seal the deal with Jessie Curl Spiralicious. In the pictures my hair looks wet/shiny, but it is fully dry FYI.In case you are wondering I use a cowash, As I Am 2 out of my 3 weekly wash days and clarify with Bounce Curl Clarifying Shampoo, and condition with Bounce Curl Super Smooth conditioner.I went crazy buying a bunch of products when I transitioned to embracing my natural hair, but hands down this product with the combination I mentioned above is a definite winner for my hair type. As you can see, I was so confident in my line-up that I went out to my first dressy outing sporting my natural hair for the first time since my transition and I was not disappointed. It gave me such confidence to know you can look “put together” with wavy/textured hair."

With moptop hair dries faster, I get better definition and glossy clumps. My hair is 2c, fine but dense, dry, heavily highlighted. I really get beautiful results. It is pretty forgiving, as if you use too much, you can easily scrunch out the cast and it won't weight your hair down a bit...this is another big difference with kinky curly...with my hair type it is pretty much impossible to get volume with kinky curly custard, but I get ton of body with lots of movement with moptop custard. The only con is the high content of glycerin that causes frizz in the super humid, high dew points days we have here in Florida. In those days, I can't usually use moptop by itself as a solo styler, but I need to top it with a hard hold-no/low glycerin gel (great with AG liquid effects, or Biosilk hard rock gelee). Not a big deal, I still get the good definition and bounciness moptop gives."

It definitely has a funky slimy texture with a strong fruity citrus smell but the smell dissipates as it dries.Pros:Adds shineSoft not crunchy curlsLightweightNatural ingredientsAffordableCons:Tames most frizz but not allOverall I am pleased to have this on hand. It is a much better alternative to the unhealthy ingredients I got from my previous gel. Still looking for something natural to completely tame my frizz without looking like a grease ball.UPDATE: After a few months of use I found that if I use a little more on top where I'm most prone to get frizz it will make a slight cast that I can break after it dries and then I'm frizz free! I just pull the locks through my fingers to unstiffen it until it looks natural.I'm also so impressed with how much volume I get with this. It doesn't weigh down my hair even though I add extra on top. Updating my rating to 5 stars. I use it daily after showering or to refresh curls. I still have plenty left. I'd guess with my medium length hair it will last at least 6 months. Great natural product and value!"

8,"﻿MopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-aloe,"I wanted to love this gel, I really did, but it's just not for me. It smells amazing and it has this really interesting thin consistency that seems perfect for not weighing down my curls.And yet, here I am, the fourth wash day using this product, and I have conceded defeat. I kept getting fuzzy, frizzy, stringy, undefined curls and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Turns out, aloe is a problem for a lot of curlies. If your hair is instantly frizzing and losing it's ""clumpage"" when you add this gel, consider that your hair might not like aloe. Look up flash-drying.I don't want to give this product a bad rating just because I didn't know aloe wouldn't work with my hair. After all, it seems to work well for lots of people! I just hope this review helps someone else who is struggling with this gel and can't figure out why."

   This stuff is my new go-to! Wish i found it sooner.I’ve never been quite sure what the difference between gel and custard/jelly is — there are so many different types of products out there! But in my experience I’ve found custards and jellys to clump my hair nicely but not necessarily define them, and I’ve found them to leave my hair looking a little greasy and leaving a weird residue on them, whereas I’ve found gels to define and hold hair much better, but often leave it crunchy with lots of flyaways. Also, gels hold seems to be too strong and leaves a lot of my waves/curls misshapen. This product has a unique texture, not 100% like either gel or jelly (see video)My hair ranges from ‘s’ wave patterns to curls (mostly underneath.) The top is prone to extreme frizziness and just general “poof” and the front pieces that frame my face are prone to losing all wave pattern. This product seems to address all my hair concerns: manages frizz, boosts curl patterns where it’s needed, and holds pretty well without leaving a weird greasy residue.Overall I’d say this product is the perfect medium between jelly and gel! More hold than a jelly but less crunch than a gel. It smells great too and i like that it comes in a jar. I use a leave in conditioner/curl cream first and then use this product to scrunch my hair, let it dry, and I’m good to go.Hope this product helps someone struggling with their hair as much as it helped me! For the price you can’t go wrong giving it a chance— I’m so glad i did :)"

Great for curly, frizzy, wavy hair in any humidity","This stuff is great! It smells slightly citrusy but not sweet, a little like baby aspirin, lol, but the smell is nice and is not strong. The texture is hard to describe - it is thick and maybe best described like ""slime"" but not slimy. It is thick and luxurious. You will only need a little to apply to your hair; I have long, thick hair, and I use about two quarter size blobs. Run through wet or damp hair and comb through, fluff your curls and then leave your hair alone. You will find that your curls are well defined, moist, and not frizzy at all. The product can be a little stiff, but if you shake your hair out, the stiffness goes away. There is absolutely no flaking at all with this product. I am also allergic to a lot of gels and mousses (the perfumes cause scalp problems), but I have no problems with this product at all. I'm picky with hair products, and I've tried a million of them. I will buy this one again!"

I have wavy 2b hair, and ever since using this product I've noticed such a change in its texture and shine. I can go longer between wash days, which in turn means my hair is looking a lot healthier and shinier. My main concern when first buying this was that it wouldn't lather as well or that my hair wouldn't be as clean and I am so happy I was wrong. The lather is a little less voluminous than your standard bottle of shampoo but it will still keep your hair very clean without making it feel like straw. Aside from all of this, a major highlight of this shampoo is the bamboo scent. I have been asked by three to four people about this shampoo because of the smell alone.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger size ( please make a 16 oz. version!!). Highly recommend!"

Liquids are too light and don't offer enough slip, and creams are too heavy and leave my waves/curls weighed down. This one is just right! It looks like a thick cream but it goes on very light. I apply it from my ears down and it leaves me with bouncy, moist curls. I adore the bamboo essence scent, which is very light and fresh with a slight citrus smell to it."

Along with Curly Girl advice, I have kept my thinning strands from frizzing (thanks Mother Nature) using that mousse and conditioning with every wash.  But I was curious to try a curly hair custard and, on a whim, bought this.  I am so glad I did. This holds my large spiral pattern as well as my old mousse, but my hair looks fuller, feels bouncier and softer.  Like there's nothing weighing it down. And on day 2, I can spritz my hair with water, scrunch, and it perks right up again.  Trying that with the Garnier left my hair looking a little flat and dirty.A small amount does the trick on my shoulder length bob, applied by scrunching it thru fairly wet strands and then carefully drying with a diffuser.  The citrus scent is nice.  The price no longer bothers me because that container is going to last me awhile and the results can't be beat.  Highly recommend!"

But my curls just aren’t as full and I would have to completely re-do my hair daily if I didn’t want to just shove it in a bun. You know what I mean- totally wet it, work in fresh product, diffuse.....I have enough hair that that gets annoying.BUT with Mop Top I get out of the shower on day one and split my wet hair down the middle, over my shoulders, take a very small scoop of the goo and twist and finger brush it through each section. Then I flip my head, scrunch my hair and diffuse.I have noticed that a tiny bit of product goes a long way and it can get crunchy, but I solve that by just rolling my curls between my hands in sections to loosen the crunch and it’s perfect!Then, my favorite part about this product:I don’t wash my hair every day when I shower. I may go 3-4 days no wash. But like I said with my previous product: I would have to re-do the entire curly process if I wanted my hair done daily. NOT with Mop Top. A few sprays with a water bottle to reform the bed head (not even enough worth diffuse drying) and boom! My hair looks like day one! For all three days! No extra product!

It foams up great and the bamboo essence scent is divine (it's a fresh, light scent with a hint of citrus). It cleans thoroughly, but like all sulfate free shampoos, there are some tricks to helping it clean properly. You must use LOTS of water...add more water, not more product, if you feel like you need more cleaning power. Also, let it sit just a bit longer than regular shampoo. After that it will leave your hair squeaky clean, with no scalp irritation from harsh sulfates. It does not dry my hair out."

This product is a little pricey to have to put back in the cabinet to wait for the dew points to get into the right range to be able to use. Live and learn.

I have tried so many products so when I came across this stuff I was like Yes! I need to try it. Well the first time I applied it I didn't seem to put enough in my hair (it doesn't state how much to put in your hair so it's trial and error I guess). Before I used it the next time I searched You Tube I found the creators page and watched how she applied it. Well she put on tons it seemed. My hair is about 3 inches shorter and so I tried to adjust the amount. My hair came out crunchy and nothing like hers. Then later that night my hair looked like I had dandruff and my head itched the rest of the night. I should have washed my hair that night because my scalp itched all night. I got up first thing and washed my hair really good but it still itched. I don't think I'll try it again for that reason. I can't stand my scalp itching!

I have 2c/3a/3b waves/curls, and this stuff helps define everything. Very strong hold (I need that for my hair) but once I ""scrunch out the crunch"" it leaves very soft hair.I wash my hair with Not Your Mother's curl defining shampoo and conditioner (pink bottles) and style with very wet hair. I take sections of my hair and mix together a cream and Jessicurl Spiralicious, apply to hair, and then I apply Mop Top. I brush each section with a Denman brush and smooth each section to encourage clumping. Then I scrunch the hell out of it and fix the wonky curls. I do that to every section and then diffuse until about 80% dry, and let air dry the rest of the way. I've used the rest of my products with a different gel, and definitely love the MopTop results better every time."

I was recommended to try this, but I couldn't find it in the local stores.  I purchased on Amazon, and it does work for my hair.  Makes it more curly and not all frizzy.  I don't have to use that much either, so this will last a good amount of time.  I do only wash twice a week though.  I just wish this wasn't so expensive, but I am willing to pay this being as it is so hard for me to find the right styling products for my hair!!UPDATE:  This worked great in the winter months but not doing all that good in the summer being as it has glycerin in this.

That is when I discovered that I have low porosity hair, and that the Deva curl gel is full of protein, which is not good for low porosity hair So, I went looking for something with minimal protein and found the Mop Top curly hair custard. I wasn't expecting much, because there are no curl holding chemicals in this gel, but I was very surprised to see that my hair was both fluffy and curly after just one little scoop (3 fingers) of gel. With Mop Top, less is more, so you don't need much. To refresh second day curls, just put a dash of gel and leave in conditioner in a small spray bottle with water. Spray and scrunch, and your curls will hold another day or two, even on fine hair. What I like the most is that this product never weighs down your hair. And it smells citrusy, which I like a lot."

For a low-poo it sudses up amazingly, and is easy to scrub into my scalp. I can tell it doesn't cleanse my scalp as well as my clarifying shampoo, but that is to be expected. I will use it 3 out of 4 washes to encourage the natural oils in my hair. It has a great balance of protein vs. moisture. And best of all is the scent - I didn't know bamboo could smell so good! It is an addicting sweet/fresh scent that makes me really look forward to wash days.

I add this right after leave-in and just before I apply a hard cast gel; I can literally feel it sucking the water into the core of my strands, and it takes my hair from dripping to just saturated with one application. Once all three products are applied, I throw my hair up into a microfiber turban until I can diffuse (for anyone that was curious about my post-wash routine).

Deva is great, but it's really expensive, plus you should change up your product occasionally to give your hair a rest.I shopped around, checked reviews, even tried some samples of a few brands, and MopTop products won the race by a mile! I'm currently using the no-poo cleansing conditioner, the daily conditioner, the leave-in conditioner, and the Curly Hair Custard. The custard was my first purchase and came with some samples from the rest of the line.I will say it works much better with a little extra moisture underneath. After conditioning (or cleansing and conditioning if it's ""wash"" day) I apply a tiny bit of the leave-in while still in the shower with SOAKING wet hair. Then I step out and apply a liberal amount of the Curly Custard, being sure to flip upside-down and side-to-side. Then scrunch scrunch scrunch. I let it air dry then loosen the cast once it's completely dry. This can also be done with a diffuser, but I don't have time for blow dryers. I find I see a lot more frizz if I skip the leave-in."

Didn't provide any better results than lesser expensive products I can buy at my local retail outlet. I bought this because it is natural and minus the sulfates, which can dry out and damage hair and scalp. My scalp has been dry for some time and I have psoriasis, which does flare up from time to time., especially when my scalp is dry. I also changed shampoos at the same time, using a cleansing conditoner free of sulfates.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't really made a difference. Additonally, it tends to create a slightly crispy texture in my hair.  This will probably not be the experience for most people as I have very, very kinky, frizzy curly hair. Although each folicle is very fine, I have a lot of it, and WITH the extreme curl, it often feels almost coarse.I am Scotch Irish and just have crazier hair than most people here buying this product. However, if you share my genetic predisposition, please understand that this may not work for you either.That all being said, the product came well packaged and smells really nice.

Research suggested that hair similar to mine benefits most from lightweight, moisturizing products. I ended up focusing more on using a lower number of moisturizing products instead of multiple lightweight products. I've used As I Am Leave In Conditioner for my dry hair since before I started this hair journey but decided to ditch it if I'm going to add on a curl activator/enhancer/gel. I tried Cantu Curl Activator, which did almost nothing to define my waves and made my hair more frizzy. I tried Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie which did help enhance my waves (not in the back though), provided decent moisture, reduced some frizz, but did not have much hold- next day waves were basically not a thing and frizz was back. Adding in Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel gave me almost no hold (Upon purchasing I didn't realize it was a light hold gel) and was very drying so I ditched that quickly and replaced it with Eco Style Gel (strong hold gel). It did help with definition and hold all around, not drying, but it wasn't optimal. I moved on to Aunt Jackie's Defining Curl Custard and no gel which impressed me with the moisture, decent hold, reduced frizz, and enhanced definition even in the 2A back of my hair- but it contains silicones that I knew would eventually weigh down my hair. Mop Top Curly Hair Custard Gel had been on my list of CGM approved products to try and I should've gone with it ages ago because this product goes beyond Aunt Jackie's. I have defined waves all around, equal hold, and it is moisturizing. I've gotten the best defined next day waves compared to all other products I've tried. With other/no products, my halo frizz is usually worse the second and third day- but even with humectants being predominant in this product, I have had no halo frizz. I usually get frizz in both dry and humid environments, I have not yet had a chance to test it on a sufficiently humid day. I am optimistic though."

Sometimes I had to perm it twice (it was the 80's when spiral perms were ""in"") just to get the curls to stick.  Over the years my hair has evolved and it has slowly developed major frizz.  However, recently I've discovered that when tamed, that frizz is actually waves/curls!  I've purchased some creams and mousses recently to make the most out of my curls, but all of the products I've tried have always resulted in tacky-to-the-touch, frizzy and crunchy stiff hair.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos and some of the ladies raved about this product and their curls did look lovely so I thought I'd by a jar and give it a try.  My jar arrived today and tonight I tried it.  It's AMAZING!!!  I towel dried my hair and applied this product to my damp hair.  This ""custard"" is runny but a little goes a long way so it didn't take much to cover my thin/fine hair.  I loved that it wasn't tacky and cause my hair to stick to my hand when I applied it.  I let my hair air-dry and I was happy to see that every time I checked on it, my curls were curling and there wasn't any frizz in sight!  When my hair was about  75% dry, I decided to defuse it and really give it the frizz test.  Once again... no frizz and my curls were even more prominent!  I've been disappointed by so many products over the years so I am so incredibly happy to find a hair product that surpassed my expectations!

Maybe that's the problem? Either way, I strongly recommend you don't order this for your hair!"

I have mulitextured hair ranging from 2b to 3a. It's fine to medium and medium density. The Moptop custard does not weigh my hair down at all and it doesn't leave a productly film I often get from other products. It definitely enhances my texture and gives me volume. I do have to top it off with another product for additional hold but that doesn't bother me...this stuff is holy grail for me.

It has shine and softness again.  No other deep conditioner has worked this effectively.  This morning I used Quidad moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (blue line), then It's a 10 leave-in + keratin (orange top) spray onto drenched curls, and easily finger-combed the Mop Top curl custard through, and scrunched several times.  Plopped my hair up in terry turban, while completing other tasks worth about 5-7 minutes. Removed towel and clipped roots up.  Once dry enough, removed clips.  My hair looked so good all work day.  Left a light gel cast, similar to Devacurl gel, until I manually loosened them up.  Then the hair was soft and even more shiny.  This product is a must if you have over dry curls."

I’m a guy with medium length mixed 3a/c curls and most specialty products targeted at my hair type are either too heavy or too drying. Have spent hundreds of dollars on product over the past two years. Nothing I’ve tried before has been this good.Hold, moisture, and shine all in one product. No need to layer product for my hair. Routine since purchasing: Co-Wash with a cheap CG-approved conditioner, glide pick through hair, rinse, apply glob of Mop Top root to end, air dry and forget about it."

I am using mostly the As I Am product line but they lack a true conditioner. I tried this conditioner to add moisture to my hair. While it does that and makes it very soft.

The barcode/info sticker looked like it had gotten wet at some point. However the contents of the container appear to be in good condition.Performance: nice texture to the gel, applies easily, smells good, dries relatively quickly. Decent amount of hold but more difficult to completely break the cast than Kinky Curly custard. Does have a lot of glycerin in it so it is not good in the summer humidity. My normally minimally frizzy 2b wavy hair looked poodle-esk after only a few minutes out air conditioning. I also had some white flaking as it apparently interacts with Miss Jessie’s  curl cream.Overall it’s an okay purchase if it’s not humid outside and I’m in a hurry to leave the house with dry hair. I think it will be more of a winter product and will update back."

Everything else has too much protein, or too much oil for my hair, leaving it dry and brittle. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it. This moisturizes very well, but never leaves my hair weighed down or greasy. It actually gets into my hair shaft, rather then just sitting on top! I have tried so many conditioners, and can not handle chemical smells. This is scented with citrus essenial oils, and the smell does not linger. It is also a very pure, natural product, which is very important to me. I am very grateful to mop top for making such a wonderful product. If not for this, my poor hair would be dry as a dessert.

Frankly, this would probably be my favorite product of all time if it weren't for the sickly-sweet and overpowering scent that just reminds me of cheap sugary products. I don't smell the ""citrus"" at all. I used it this morning and although the scent has faded over time, my headache that came from it is still lingering. If there's an unscented version of this product, I'd jump on it without hesitation. As is, though, I wouldn't buy it again."

It did create a *little bit* of a cast.My hair looks great, however next time I'll use a little more product and see what happens. And then I'll try a bit of gel with it, and report back. So far I am very happy with this product."

If you like smelling like candied coconut mixed with playdough...you'll love this scent! I had to spray hairspray or perfume on my head anytime I conditioned with this. Not only that, it left the most residue and buildup in my hair I've ever had. Let me remind you, I used this for 3 months, not changing any other products and this conditioner made my hair greasy, stringy, and smelling like a literal child covered in playdough. Honestly, the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life."

Her hair is fairly wavy but before Mop Top it just looked messy so I always put it up in pony tails.  I got recommended a bunch of products but was looking for a more affordable option for my 4 year old.  I really like this stuff.  It smells great (so good that I use it in my hair to keep down my fly always because of the nice scent!).  It helps define her curls in the morning.  We hair wash at night, so by morning her hair is just a wavy bed head mess.  All I really need is this Mop Top stuff, although sometimes I do a detangler or mousse.  But I've found Mop Top is all I really need to make her hair presentable to wear curly."

I hate stuff that leaves my hair feeling dirty or heavy! I'm so glad I took the leap! I made my mom try it (who never does anything with her hair) and it made her hair so much healthier looking... and brought the curls out so nicely!

I've tried other custards and a flaxseed gel with the same consistency and it just isn't my thing. I have fine hair, and used this at the beginning of my CG transistion, so it was kind of a 2a-2b wave. The product was nice for a wash-and-wear, one product look. It also smells like Sprite to me, which is a pleasant and not over powering smell. Unlike some custards, it didn't make my hair look stringy if I used a little too much. I gave what I had left to a friend with coarser, 3b-3c hair and she likes it as a wash-and-wear as well."

I really like it for both of our hair. It actually leaves my daughter's fine hair kind of plumped. If you leave it in awhile, it deeply moisturizes and feels almost like buttery smooth. Yet still is so light, unlike butters and oils that weigh hair down.  It's keeping my 2B waves much more bouncy as oppose to some of the heavier butter like cowashing I did in the past.  I plan to use this for my daily conditioner."

I’m a loyal Deva Curl user for many years but my curly hair is getting looser the older I get, and a good product is needed more than ever to alleviate frizz and define curl. The smell is a mild citrus, very tolerable, and the texture appears water soluble and blended well into my damp hair. No residue and dried slightly crisp which I could somewhat shake out. However I prefer a stronger hold, especially as the day wears on in humidity. The key is to leave your hair alone when you apply product and that’s always a challenge. With Deva, I combine several different products to get good hold. This one does it all by itself. I’m very pleased so far."

This product is not heavy, is not crunchy, and provides some volume with zero frizz. It can be used on its own for curl and medium hold or under a gel as just a curl activator.

I bought a tub of it back in September 2018 and I just finally ran out in May 2019. Coming on here to order more made me realize I should leave a review! A little bit of this goes a long way and you really don't need to use more than a nickel to quarter size amount depending on how much hair you have. Too much will actually cause you to end up with flakes so definitely start cautiously until you figure your perfect amount out.

I used this product alone and it worked fine. It does leave a crunchy cast which is good for wavy/curly girls to maintain a curl pattern. I scrunch it out later if I air dry or even after I diffuse. I have never used a hair custard before. A little goes a looong way which is good for the price. It feels like the slim I used to play with as a little girl, and the smell is nice and citrusy. It is up in the air if I will repurchase it and if so, it won't be for a long time because the tub is large."

I was putting MT over my B'Leave In and the results were good but not great. I used it alone and BAM! I had to die for curls. What works for me is to coat my hair, scrunch and plop for 30 minutes and then diffuse without touching my hair at high heat high speed until 80% dry, then go for the roots at medium heat/speed, then finish on the ends. WORTH THE WORK! I finally love my wavy/curly hair!"

It left my hair sticky and stringy and with frizz and fly-aways for days. Also, no matter how little I used, there was no scrunching out the crunch. It just stayed crunchy even after diffusing.

I use it in combination with a curl cream, because my hair is thick and needs a lot of moisture, but this product can be a one-step curl routine for finer hair. I like it better than Deva Curl gel. It has better hold and does some special slip action that is very moisturizing and unique to the product. I also like the way it sculpts my curls a little bit more than the Deva gels. I love the definition I get from this product. Although you use a generous amount, I wouldn't load it on too thick, because it is fairly strong. You need to be kind of sparing when reapplying on second day hair--I would recommend not reapplying to the whole head. My only criticism is that it can create slightly more buildup than other lighter gels, like Deva. The smell is citrusy and lovely. The ingredients are VERY clean. Buy, buy, buy."

This stuff is fantastic. I have very dry, thick wavy/curly hair, and it gets weighted down and looks unhealthy. This custard leaves my hair soft and gives me defined curls to even the most stubborn strands of hair that just look frizzy. I've been applying it to wet hair, letting it dry for an hour, and then diffuse. I need to add just a tiny bit more after diffusing to tame flyaways, but that's it. I typically laugh at products that claim you need a quarter sized amount - that's such a load of garbage for anyone with longer, thick hair. But this stuff....you do not need a lot to go along way! This custard has replaced 2 other products that I no longer need in my routine. I'm super happy so far!!!!!!!!!"

This does not so it doesn't work if used alone for me. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I need the cast for my hair to hold up for 2nd or 3rd day hair. If it's too soft on 1st day hair, it wont hold up. HOWEVER, this product is still GREAT! It adds great definition to your curls and it is very forgiving if you use too much. If you like soft touch hold with defined curls, then this is for you. I actually combine it with another gel. I first use it on really damp hair as a ""primer"" and then finish off with the devacurl arc angel ultra hold gel. I don't have to use nearly as much devacurl gel and the combination of both products give me great definition. I will be purchasing it again."

The very first time I washed with this shampoo, I noticed that large sections of my scalp were covered in flaking skin. This was mostly an issue around my crown and forehead area. It was the strangest thing; the flaking would begin immediately after use (noticeable even under wet hair) and continue to get worse for the day or two after washing. After the hair dried, it would begin to itch and continue to get itchier as time passed. I'm not sure if it was just dry flaky skin or if it was actual dandruff, but the amount of whatever it was was astonishing (and gross).I stopped using the shampoo after about a week, and my problems stopped then, but I've used it a couple of times since (when I was desperate and out of other shampoos) and had the same problem. It's super weird but I haven't heard of anyone else having the same issue. Other than that, it smelled good and did a fine job washing my actual hair, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else experiences something similar."
784,"﻿MopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome so far!!,"I have been following the curly girl method for 5 months and have been experimenting with different products and different ways to apply them.  I received a sample of this custard and I love it so far! It made my 2C/3A curls even more curly!  I use a denman brush when I wash my hair, then I scrunch this into wet hair on top of homemade flax seed gel.  I only used a nickel sized amount on my thin hair which is just past my shoulders.  My curls were popping like never before!  It does have glycerin but it's winter now so it works great 4 me.  Not sure how well it will work in the humid summer because of the glycerin.I see some reviewers complained about this gel making their hair crunchy but keep in mind you're supposed to scrunch the hardness out of your hair in order to get soft curls.  Other reviewers complained of flaking but this wasn't an issue for me as i used on wet hair and did not mess with my curls after they dried and I ""scrunched out the crunch"".  Maybe ""scrunching out the crunch"" with some light oil would help with that?  Anyway, I give this stuff 2 thumbs up!"
785,"﻿MopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",3.0 out of 5 stars,really nice product for dry hair...,"I don't have dry hair or course hair, my hair is baby fine and too soft, so these products are too heavy for my hair.Thankfully, I only bought a sample pack from her website, so I didn't spend $$ on something that I would not use.I recommend the sample for those of you who are not sure about this product for your hair. The shampoo was too moisturizing for my hair and the conditioner was ridiculously too oily for my hair. I had a film of oil on my hair and mybody after I tried rinsing it out, so I had to go back and rewash with my regular shampoo. I do not recommend this forsoft fine hair, but I think it would be great for course dry hair."

I don't get it."
787,"﻿MopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's alright but better products out there for cheaper,"This product smells really nice, like limes.  It feels like that sugar body scrub you use.  I put some on my damp hair.  It will hold some of the curl in, but when it dries it turns hard like glue then starts to flake.  Compared to Ampro gel, which is much cheaper, I like Ampro better.  Ampro will smooth out my hair and make it straighter as it is holding it down.  Plus when it dries, it is not hard as glue, comes out easy and does not damage hair.  Ampro does very little flaking as well.  Back to that,"

I tried this several times and it was way too heavy for my hair. So, I got the idea of diluting a little with water, so that I could put it in a squeeze bottle and apply to my hair. It works great. My curls look as good with this product as any other curl enhancer that I have used.  I use a few pumps of deva curl ultra defining gel on top."

It doesn’t perform as well as I hoped. Compared to my other leave-ins which are the Kinky Curly Knot Today and the Shea Moisture silicone-free miracle treatment, it just doesn’t penetrate my hair strands as much and i gel it sort of sits on top of my hair. I also have to apply a lot of it to get any sort of effect. I don’t think I will be reaching for this product often."

But this one, man oh man! I am glad that I found this product!!!! I’ve always tried curly hair girl approved products , but they always weight down my curls and my hair gets super frizzy even though I diffuse. I don’t diffuse at all , so it would make me upset that even though I diffuse my hair would still get super frizzy! I would try so many methods and nothing! However, this product , I recently purchased the sample packets off their Instagram page. And I am so happy that I finally found a product that does justice to my hair!!!! Thank you, thank you!

Turns out it wasn’t for me. I like no-crunch custard and this leaves my hair dry, frizzy and crunchy.  And if I put it in my hair a little too much, it leaves some white flakes. I live in East Asia so maybe the climate can be one of the reason why it’s not doing the work? Anyhow I would recommend this for someone who likes crunchy strong hold gel, but I wouldn’t personally buy it again."

I’ve used it twice so far and am just not impressed. It works okay... but it doesn’t have as much slip as I hoped so it’s hard to finger detangle my hair. It does clean my hair but I feel it is stripping away some moisture. When I compare it to the other Co-wash I own, which is the AS I AM Coconut cowash, it doesn’t perform as well."
796,"﻿MopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",2.0 out of 5 stars,This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely,"This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely, and helps keep the curl controlled as my hair dries.  Does not make my hair frizzy.  It smells nice, sweet like some kind of candy.  The reason for 2 stars is the bottle it comes in.  The product itself is pretty thick, like pudding.  It does not flow.  The plastic bottle it's in is thick hard plastic. It's ridiculously difficult to squeeze a thick, pudding-like product out of a narrow-necked stiff plastic bottle.  If you take the cap off you can ""shake"" it out, which is what I do, but it's not ideal considering that sometimes it shakes out a huge glob bigger than you need, which is a hassle again to scrape the excess back in.  The directions for use on the bottle state in bold letters, ""shake well"".  Lol, how do you shake this product well, especially when the bottle is brand new and filled to the top, and for what purpose?  Does the product separate as it sits it something.  No.  I just think there must be a lot of people in the company who don't understand the product or use it themselves.  The product would be better contained in a jar with a lid that you can dip your fingers into, or maybe a soft squeezable tube that can be stored upside down.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It doesn't seem like the manufacturer understands its own product. It's not exactly a bargain price either."

However, for my thick, frizzy 2B hair, this custard totally weighed down my hair. It didn't even work like a gel — no definition, no crunch. My hair was flatter than ever.

802,"﻿MopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprising Good!,"I bought these products after winning the travel sized kit and loving the daily conditioner.  I like the gentle shampoo because it cleaned my hair without stripping all the natural oils.  The deep conditioner didn't give me the same kind of slip for detangling as the the daily conditioner, but it did what it said it would do.  The leave it in conditioner gave my hair a light hold like a gel without the crunchy hardness of a gel.  It also left my hair soft and smooth.  I will for sure buy the leave it in conditioner and the gentle shampoo again.  I gave this review a 4 not 5 stars because the deep conditioner doesn't have the same slip as the daily conditioner.  The daily conditioner is the best conditioner for slip I have every used.  If you have frizzy curly hair these products are awesome.  It costs more, but these products are very high in and they work.  I have kinky curly hair and I love these products.  BTW it your hair is protein sensitive don't use the deep conditioner more then once a week."

I applied a generous amount of this product to a section of my hair last nite and my curls were still a bit crunchy. I thought that maybe I had product build up in my hair so I shampooed my hair today and re-applied a generous amount again to my entire hair and my curls were still a bit crunchy and stiff so I decided to ponytail my hair and leave a few strands out. This product smells amazing but didn’t give me the moist curls & softness as described.

The consistency is both thinner and a bit stickier than what I've been used to, but it's working for me just as well.  For context, my hair is naturally wavy/curly when short.  After washing I apply a small dab of leave-in conditioner, then use the custard, push into shape with my fingers and air dry.I have bits of hair on the side of my head that are a little stubborn with trying to curl the wrong direction and this holds them in place.  Which is good considering I've been resorting to at-home covid-cuts lol."

However, it has no preservatives in it and can actually “go bad” if it sits to long. I usually get it from my hair salon, but found it here on amazon and decided to order it. When it arrived, the tubs were wrapped in additional plastic (which is different from the salon) and the safety seal was missing. The thing that bothered me though was the color, consistency and smell of the product. It is supposed to smell wonderful (somewhat sweet but not overpowering) with a light opal color the consistency of thick honey. This was fowl smelling, runny and darker than it was supposed to be. Long story long, great product but buy it at a store so you can check it’s color!"

I have 2B, low porosity, fine-medium strands, high density hair. This custard smells great and is very concentrated, ensure you emulsify well when applying.  Custards don’t typically provide a lot of hold but I do think this product has a good amount of hold on its own. I typically use it on wash days but have used it to refresh and it will revive and hold my waves. Product smells great, citrusy like a Kumquat but the smell unfortunately will not linger (I personally would love to smell like this product all day long). The product does contain protein and glycerin. It has held up well even in humidity despite the glycerin content. This is likely because I DO layer this product with 2 other stylers that I think are a great combination and compliment each other superbly. I use the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curl Magic as a base, Moptop Curl Custard second, and seal the deal with Jessie Curl Spiralicious. In the pictures my hair looks wet/shiny, but it is fully dry FYI.In case you are wondering I use a cowash, As I Am 2 out of my 3 weekly wash days and clarify with Bounce Curl Clarifying Shampoo, and condition with Bounce Curl Super Smooth conditioner.I went crazy buying a bunch of products when I transitioned to embracing my natural hair, but hands down this product with the combination I mentioned above is a definite winner for my hair type. As you can see, I was so confident in my line-up that I went out to my first dressy outing sporting my natural hair for the first time since my transition and I was not disappointed. It gave me such confidence to know you can look “put together” with wavy/textured hair."

With moptop hair dries faster, I get better definition and glossy clumps. My hair is 2c, fine but dense, dry, heavily highlighted. I really get beautiful results. It is pretty forgiving, as if you use too much, you can easily scrunch out the cast and it won't weight your hair down a bit...this is another big difference with kinky curly...with my hair type it is pretty much impossible to get volume with kinky curly custard, but I get ton of body with lots of movement with moptop custard. The only con is the high content of glycerin that causes frizz in the super humid, high dew points days we have here in Florida. In those days, I can't usually use moptop by itself as a solo styler, but I need to top it with a hard hold-no/low glycerin gel (great with AG liquid effects, or Biosilk hard rock gelee). Not a big deal, I still get the good definition and bounciness moptop gives."

Still looking for something natural to completely tame my frizz without looking like a grease ball.UPDATE: After a few months of use I found that if I use a little more on top where I'm most prone to get frizz it will make a slight cast that I can break after it dries and then I'm frizz free! I just pull the locks through my fingers to unstiffen it until it looks natural.I'm also so impressed with how much volume I get with this. It doesn't weigh down my hair even though I add extra on top. Updating my rating to 5 stars. I use it daily after showering or to refresh curls. I still have plenty left.

I kept getting fuzzy, frizzy, stringy, undefined curls and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Turns out, aloe is a problem for a lot of curlies. If your hair is instantly frizzing and losing it's ""clumpage"" when you add this gel, consider that your hair might not like aloe. Look up flash-drying.I don't want to give this product a bad rating just because I didn't know aloe wouldn't work with my hair. After all, it seems to work well for lots of people!

   This stuff is my new go-to! Wish i found it sooner.I’ve never been quite sure what the difference between gel and custard/jelly is — there are so many different types of products out there! But in my experience I’ve found custards and jellys to clump my hair nicely but not necessarily define them, and I’ve found them to leave my hair looking a little greasy and leaving a weird residue on them, whereas I’ve found gels to define and hold hair much better, but often leave it crunchy with lots of flyaways. Also, gels hold seems to be too strong and leaves a lot of my waves/curls misshapen. This product has a unique texture, not 100% like either gel or jelly (see video)My hair ranges from ‘s’ wave patterns to curls (mostly underneath.) The top is prone to extreme frizziness and just general “poof” and the front pieces that frame my face are prone to losing all wave pattern. This product seems to address all my hair concerns: manages frizz, boosts curl patterns where it’s needed, and holds pretty well without leaving a weird greasy residue.Overall I’d say this product is the perfect medium between jelly and gel! More hold than a jelly but less crunch than a gel. It smells great too and i like that it comes in a jar. I use a leave in conditioner/curl cream first and then use this product to scrunch my hair, let it dry, and I’m good to go.Hope this product helps someone struggling with their hair as much as it helped me! For the price you can’t go wrong giving it a chance— I’m so glad i did :)"

Great for curly, frizzy, wavy hair in any humidity","This stuff is great! It smells slightly citrusy but not sweet, a little like baby aspirin, lol, but the smell is nice and is not strong. The texture is hard to describe - it is thick and maybe best described like ""slime"" but not slimy. It is thick and luxurious. You will only need a little to apply to your hair; I have long, thick hair, and I use about two quarter size blobs. Run through wet or damp hair and comb through, fluff your curls and then leave your hair alone. You will find that your curls are well defined, moist, and not frizzy at all. The product can be a little stiff, but if you shake your hair out, the stiffness goes away. There is absolutely no flaking at all with this product. I am also allergic to a lot of gels and mousses (the perfumes cause scalp problems), but I have no problems with this product at all. I'm picky with hair products, and I've tried a million of them.

I have wavy 2b hair, and ever since using this product I've noticed such a change in its texture and shine. I can go longer between wash days, which in turn means my hair is looking a lot healthier and shinier. My main concern when first buying this was that it wouldn't lather as well or that my hair wouldn't be as clean and I am so happy I was wrong. The lather is a little less voluminous than your standard bottle of shampoo but it will still keep your hair very clean without making it feel like straw. Aside from all of this, a major highlight of this shampoo is the bamboo scent. I have been asked by three to four people about this shampoo because of the smell alone.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger size ( please make a 16 oz. version!!). Highly recommend!"

Along with Curly Girl advice, I have kept my thinning strands from frizzing (thanks Mother Nature) using that mousse and conditioning with every wash.  But I was curious to try a curly hair custard and, on a whim, bought this.  I am so glad I did. This holds my large spiral pattern as well as my old mousse, but my hair looks fuller, feels bouncier and softer.  Like there's nothing weighing it down. And on day 2, I can spritz my hair with water, scrunch, and it perks right up again.  Trying that with the Garnier left my hair looking a little flat and dirty.A small amount does the trick on my shoulder length bob, applied by scrunching it thru fairly wet strands and then carefully drying with a diffuser.  The citrus scent is nice.  The price no longer bothers me because that container is going to last me awhile and the results can't be beat.  Highly recommend!"

You know what I mean- totally wet it, work in fresh product, diffuse.....I have enough hair that that gets annoying.BUT with Mop Top I get out of the shower on day one and split my wet hair down the middle, over my shoulders, take a very small scoop of the goo and twist and finger brush it through each section. Then I flip my head, scrunch my hair and diffuse.I have noticed that a tiny bit of product goes a long way and it can get crunchy, but I solve that by just rolling my curls between my hands in sections to loosen the crunch and it’s perfect!Then, my favorite part about this product:I don’t wash my hair every day when I shower. I may go 3-4 days no wash. But like I said with my previous product: I would have to re-do the entire curly process if I wanted my hair done daily. NOT with Mop Top. A few sprays with a water bottle to reform the bed head (not even enough worth diffuse drying) and boom! My hair looks like day one! For all three days! No extra product!

Before I used it the next time I searched You Tube I found the creators page and watched how she applied it. Well she put on tons it seemed. My hair is about 3 inches shorter and so I tried to adjust the amount. My hair came out crunchy and nothing like hers. Then later that night my hair looked like I had dandruff and my head itched the rest of the night. I should have washed my hair that night because my scalp itched all night. I got up first thing and washed my hair really good but it still itched. I don't think I'll try it again for that reason. I can't stand my scalp itching!

I wasn't expecting much, because there are no curl holding chemicals in this gel, but I was very surprised to see that my hair was both fluffy and curly after just one little scoop (3 fingers) of gel. With Mop Top, less is more, so you don't need much. To refresh second day curls, just put a dash of gel and leave in conditioner in a small spray bottle with water. Spray and scrunch, and your curls will hold another day or two, even on fine hair. What I like the most is that this product never weighs down your hair. And it smells citrusy, which I like a lot."

I bought this because it is natural and minus the sulfates, which can dry out and damage hair and scalp.

I also changed shampoos at the same time, using a cleansing conditoner free of sulfates.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't really made a difference. Additonally, it tends to create a slightly crispy texture in my hair.  This will probably not be the experience for most people as I have very, very kinky, frizzy curly hair.

Research suggested that hair similar to mine benefits most from lightweight, moisturizing products. I ended up focusing more on using a lower number of moisturizing products instead of multiple lightweight products. I've used As I Am Leave In Conditioner for my dry hair since before I started this hair journey but decided to ditch it if I'm going to add on a curl activator/enhancer/gel. I tried Cantu Curl Activator, which did almost nothing to define my waves and made my hair more frizzy. I tried Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie which did help enhance my waves (not in the back though), provided decent moisture, reduced some frizz, but did not have much hold- next day waves were basically not a thing and frizz was back. Adding in Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel gave me almost no hold (Upon purchasing I didn't realize it was a light hold gel) and was very drying so I ditched that quickly and replaced it with Eco Style Gel (strong hold gel). It did help with definition and hold all around, not drying, but it wasn't optimal. I moved on to Aunt Jackie's Defining Curl Custard and no gel which impressed me with the moisture, decent hold, reduced frizz, and enhanced definition even in the 2A back of my hair- but it contains silicones that I knew would eventually weigh down my hair. Mop Top Curly Hair Custard Gel had been on my list of CGM approved products to try and I should've gone with it ages ago because this product goes beyond Aunt Jackie's. I have defined waves all around, equal hold, and it is moisturizing. I've gotten the best defined next day waves compared to all other products I've tried. With other/no products, my halo frizz is usually worse the second and third day- but even with humectants being predominant in this product, I have had no halo frizz. I usually get frizz in both dry and humid environments, I have not yet had a chance to test it on a sufficiently humid day. I am optimistic though."

This ""custard"" is runny but a little goes a long way so it didn't take much to cover my thin/fine hair.  I loved that it wasn't tacky and cause my hair to stick to my hand when I applied it.  I let my hair air-dry and I was happy to see that every time I checked on it, my curls were curling and there wasn't any frizz in sight!  When my hair was about  75% dry, I decided to defuse it and really give it the frizz test.  Once again... no frizz and my curls were even more prominent!  I've been disappointed by so many products over the years so I am so incredibly happy to find a hair product that surpassed my expectations!  I'm new to MopTop hair products but I'll definitely be giving other MopTop products a try in the future.I highly recommend this product."

I used this after using shampoo and conditioner and it was NOT thick enough nor did I feel like it penetrated the hair shaft. I tend to look the other way when I see a product that claims to work on ALL hair types including fine hair... I am a women of color and my hair is FAR from fine. Save your money if you have kinky coarse textured hair as this will not be enough for you. If you have fine hair and are type 3 and above will probably work great for you.

Some aspects that I was dreading was my hair not drying for six hours and significant gel residue on the nape of my neck and on my chest that is even hard to get off with wet towel.  Thankfully Kinky Curly was out of stock. I washed my hair and applied Moptop and went outside in the hot sun and did yardwork. Sweating profusely. Most of my hair dried though! I pulled and stretched out the curls and still have good definition. Going out for a walk with temp still 86f. Will see how good of a hold I keep. That is always a challenge for me though. End of day my curls have lost a lot of definition. I have super fine non porous bi racial hair and have to scrunch my hair to get curls and use tangle teaser too, to help bring out my curls.

Plopped my hair up in terry turban, while completing other tasks worth about 5-7 minutes. Removed towel and clipped roots up.  Once dry enough, removed clips.  My hair looked so good all work day.  Left a light gel cast, similar to Devacurl gel, until I manually loosened them up.  Then the hair was soft and even more shiny.  This product is a must if you have over dry curls."

The barcode/info sticker looked like it had gotten wet at some point. However the contents of the container appear to be in good condition.Performance: nice texture to the gel, applies easily, smells good, dries relatively quickly. Decent amount of hold but more difficult to completely break the cast than Kinky Curly custard. Does have a lot of glycerin in it so it is not good in the summer humidity. My normally minimally frizzy 2b wavy hair looked poodle-esk after only a few minutes out air conditioning. I also had some white flaking as it apparently interacts with Miss Jessie’s  curl cream.Overall it’s an okay purchase if it’s not humid outside and I’m in a hurry to leave the house with dry hair.

However I prefer a stronger hold, especially as the day wears on in humidity. The key is to leave your hair alone when you apply product and that’s always a challenge.

This product is not heavy, is not crunchy, and provides some volume with zero frizz. It can be used on its own for curl and medium hold or under a gel as just a curl activator.

Amazon needs to do better with the way they ship their items. Aside from that the product so far is good, it provides real good hold and smells good. The only con is that if you use too much you will see flakes all around your hair. It is best used on soaking wet hair so it will glide smoothly. I’m hoping it will work great during the summer months."

I am more than happy with my Mop Top Curly Hair Custard and I will be repurchasing."

Scent is very overpowering and I smell it all day and it's very distracting. Also this sucked up a lot of water when styling so I had to rewet my hair several times more than normal.

It's my favorite gel for my 3a(ish) hair. I use it in combination with a curl cream, because my hair is thick and needs a lot of moisture, but this product can be a one-step curl routine for finer hair. I like it better than Deva Curl gel. It has better hold and does some special slip action that is very moisturizing and unique to the product. I also like the way it sculpts my curls a little bit more than the Deva gels. I love the definition I get from this product. Although you use a generous amount, I wouldn't load it on too thick, because it is fairly strong. You need to be kind of sparing when reapplying on second day hair--I would recommend not reapplying to the whole head. My only criticism is that it can create slightly more buildup than other lighter gels, like Deva. The smell is citrusy and lovely. The ingredients are VERY clean. Buy, buy, buy."

This does not so it doesn't work if used alone for me. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I need the cast for my hair to hold up for 2nd or 3rd day hair. If it's too soft on 1st day hair, it wont hold up. HOWEVER, this product is still GREAT! It adds great definition to your curls and it is very forgiving if you use too much. If you like soft touch hold with defined curls, then this is for you. I actually combine it with another gel. I first use it on really damp hair as a ""primer"" and then finish off with the devacurl arc angel ultra hold gel. I don't have to use nearly as much devacurl gel and the combination of both products give me great definition. I will be purchasing it again."

The very first time I washed with this shampoo, I noticed that large sections of my scalp were covered in flaking skin. This was mostly an issue around my crown and forehead area. It was the strangest thing; the flaking would begin immediately after use (noticeable even under wet hair) and continue to get worse for the day or two after washing. After the hair dried, it would begin to itch and continue to get itchier as time passed. I'm not sure if it was just dry flaky skin or if it was actual dandruff, but the amount of whatever it was was astonishing (and gross).I stopped using the shampoo after about a week, and my problems stopped then, but I've used it a couple of times since (when I was desperate and out of other shampoos) and had the same problem. It's super weird but I haven't heard of anyone else having the same issue. Other than that, it smelled good and did a fine job washing my actual hair, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else experiences something similar."

I received a sample of this custard and I love it so far! It made my 2C/3A curls even more curly!  I use a denman brush when I wash my hair, then I scrunch this into wet hair on top of homemade flax seed gel.  I only used a nickel sized amount on my thin hair which is just past my shoulders.  My curls were popping like never before!  It does have glycerin but it's winter now so it works great 4 me.  Not sure how well it will work in the humid summer because of the glycerin.I see some reviewers complained about this gel making their hair crunchy but keep in mind you're supposed to scrunch the hardness out of your hair in order to get soft curls.  Other reviewers complained of flaking but this wasn't an issue for me as i used on wet hair and did not mess with my curls after they dried and I ""scrunched out the crunch"".  Maybe ""scrunching out the crunch"" with some light oil would help with that?  Anyway, I give this stuff 2 thumbs up!"

It feels like that sugar body scrub you use.  I put some on my damp hair.  It will hold some of the curl in, but when it dries it turns hard like glue then starts to flake.  Compared to Ampro gel, which is much cheaper, I like Ampro better.  Ampro will smooth out my hair and make it straighter as it is holding it down.  Plus when it dries, it is not hard as glue, comes out easy and does not damage hair.  Ampro does very little flaking as well.  Back to that,"

It glides through my curly hair nicely,"This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely, and helps keep the curl controlled as my hair dries.  Does not make my hair frizzy.  It smells nice, sweet like some kind of candy.  The reason for 2 stars is the bottle it comes in.  The product itself is pretty thick, like pudding.  It does not flow.  The plastic bottle it's in is thick hard plastic. It's ridiculously difficult to squeeze a thick, pudding-like product out of a narrow-necked stiff plastic bottle.  If you take the cap off you can ""shake"" it out, which is what I do, but it's not ideal considering that sometimes it shakes out a huge glob bigger than you need, which is a hassle again to scrape the excess back in.  The directions for use on the bottle state in bold letters, ""shake well"".  Lol, how do you shake this product well, especially when the bottle is brand new and filled to the top, and for what purpose?  Does the product separate as it sits it something.  No.  I just think there must be a lot of people in the company who don't understand the product or use it themselves.  The product would be better contained in a jar with a lid that you can dip your fingers into, or maybe a soft squeezable tube that can be stored upside down.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It doesn't seem like the manufacturer understands its own product. It's not exactly a bargain price either."

I like the gentle shampoo because it cleaned my hair without stripping all the natural oils.

The leave it in conditioner gave my hair a light hold like a gel without the crunchy hardness of a gel.  It also left my hair soft and smooth.  I will for sure buy the leave it in conditioner and the gentle shampoo again.  I gave this review a 4 not 5 stars because the deep conditioner doesn't have the same slip as the daily conditioner.  The daily conditioner is the best conditioner for slip I have every used.  If you have frizzy curly hair these products are awesome.  It costs more, but these products are very high in and they work.  I have kinky curly hair and I love these products.  BTW it your hair is protein sensitive don't use the deep conditioner more then once a week."

Based off of other reviews this stuff should have been a miracle. Our experience was more like a nightmare! After fully drying this stuff flakes uncontrollably. I tried several application methods and all resulted in a disgusting amount of flakes. Even with my daughter's hair pulled back and her not touching it. The hair of her ponytail rubbing against itself and the back of her shirt left flakes everywhere. Yuck!!!

I applied a generous amount of this product to a section of my hair last nite and my curls were still a bit crunchy.

The consistency is both thinner and a bit stickier than what I've been used to, but it's working for me just as well.  For context, my hair is naturally wavy/curly when short.  After washing I apply a small dab of leave-in conditioner, then use the custard, push into shape with my fingers and air dry.I have bits of hair on the side of my head that are a little stubborn with trying to curl the wrong direction and this holds them in place.

I have very curly hair that has been dry and brittle as long as I can remember. A stylist recommended MopTop products to me 7 years ago, and I have used them ever since. After 2 months of using this conditioner, my stylist could not believe the change in my hair. It is soft and manageable, and no longer brittle (even though I color it regularly).While this product is recommended for weekly (or as needed) deep conditioning, I use it as a daily conditioner. It doesn't take much, so a jar lasts me about 2-3 months. It doesn't weigh my hair down, and when combined with MopTop Medium Hold Gel, or my new favorite, Curly Hair Custard, it leaves me with touchable curls.

I've tried expensive, store bought, home-made, etc., but when I found MopTop, I stopped looking and only added their products to my routine one-by-one. The Deep Conditioner is like having dessert. I use it once a week and leave it in and my hair is amazing afterwards. I actually shampoo every day and their products are so nurturing that my hair is never dry or frizzy. I'm so excited to see this on Amazon Prime, and I will be ordering here forever and ever. Their customer service is equal to their product. Down through the years, I've gotten in touch with the owner and creator as well as people who work there. They told me tricks, chatted with me, and gave me confidence to experiment. For all you curly girls (and guys) out there, stop looking now! I also use the daily conditioner, the curly custard, and their shampoo. I love shampooing in the mornings!"
2,"MopTop Deep Conditioner, Wavy, Curly & Coily, Color or Chemically Treated & Natural Hair Moisturizing Mask, made w/ Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey that reduces Frizz increases Moisture & Manageability",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Slip and wonderful smell,"I LOVE this product. It has so much slip and it is just luxurious. I have waist length curly hair that I am trying to nurse back to health after using too many silicone products. I haven't been using this long enough to speak to long term hair health, though I have high hope based on m y short term use experience. The SMELL is AMAZING! It also really helps me detangle without breaking my hair. Whenever I wear my hair pineapple style on my head it ends up pretty tangled. Unfortunately this is one of my favorite ways to wear my hair and I had all but stopped doing it before I found this product. This makes it so easy to detangle, I am in heaven. Oh, and did I mention the AMAZING smell =) It is very thick and very hydrating, it does not leave my hair feeling heavy or weighed down, though it might be too much for regular use if you have fine hair. I have medium hair and using this 1 time per week has been great so far. I have not noticed a reduction of frizz at this point, but I don't really expect that from a conditioner given my hair and the weather where I live. I will update with long term hair health when I have been using it a while longer. Thank you MopTop for making this! I will definitely be trying your other products!"

I is 2b curly and I deep conditioner like this one once a week.  It works great and doesn't weigh down my hair.  I have been using it for years. It is very thick and a little goes a long way.

There maybe better alternatives.,"I had been using a Curl Junkie conditioner that I love. After a while, it seemed to be a little less effective. I thought I would try another conditioner since I heard it is good to switch products occasionally. Who knows though, this maybe an old wives tale. I saw that this product was recommended for me on NaturallyCurly.com, so I gave it a try. I have 2c hair. It works fine, but I have just had better. It doesn't leave my hair as shiny and smooth as other conditioners have. The smell is ok. It is some kind of odd version of a minty fragrance. It doesn't bother me though. The conditioner is very think, which makes your hair feel moisturized in the shower. It also helps me detangle my hair while wet. It's just that when it dries, it doesn't quite do it for me. This would be a great switch if you are not using a curly hair ""approved"" conditioner like many you see in the drugstore. You will probably benefit a lot. If you have used many curly conditioners, this one maybe a bit disappointing. You can always give it a try and see how it works for your hair."

I have used this product for over a year now and my curls have become healthier, stronger and more moisturized. After years of heat damage, this conditioner hydrated my damaged curls without weighing it down and after continuous use it helped tame my frizzies!! I have only used this product as a conditioner after cleansing, however it can be used as an intense conditioner by leaving it in your hair 20-30 mins under the dryer.  With this conditioner a little goes a very long way and the subtle scent is just an added bonus.  Definitely worth the price!!"

However, it has no preservatives in it and can actually “go bad” if it sits to long. I usually get it from my hair salon, but found it here on amazon and decided to order it. When it arrived, the tubs were wrapped in additional plastic (which is different from the salon) and the safety seal was missing. The thing that bothered me though was the color, consistency and smell of the product. It is supposed to smell wonderful (somewhat sweet but not overpowering) with a light opal color the consistency of thick honey. This was fowl smelling, runny and darker than it was supposed to be. Long story long, great product but buy it at a store so you can check it’s color!"

I have 2B, low porosity, fine-medium strands, high density hair. This custard smells great and is very concentrated, ensure you emulsify well when applying.  Custards don’t typically provide a lot of hold but I do think this product has a good amount of hold on its own. I typically use it on wash days but have used it to refresh and it will revive and hold my waves. Product smells great, citrusy like a Kumquat but the smell unfortunately will not linger (I personally would love to smell like this product all day long). The product does contain protein and glycerin. It has held up well even in humidity despite the glycerin content. This is likely because I DO layer this product with 2 other stylers that I think are a great combination and compliment each other superbly. I use the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curl Magic as a base, Moptop Curl Custard second, and seal the deal with Jessie Curl Spiralicious. In the pictures my hair looks wet/shiny, but it is fully dry FYI.In case you are wondering I use a cowash, As I Am 2 out of my 3 weekly wash days and clarify with Bounce Curl Clarifying Shampoo, and condition with Bounce Curl Super Smooth conditioner.I went crazy buying a bunch of products when I transitioned to embracing my natural hair, but hands down this product with the combination I mentioned above is a definite winner for my hair type. As you can see, I was so confident in my line-up that I went out to my first dressy outing sporting my natural hair for the first time since my transition and I was not disappointed. It gave me such confidence to know you can look “put together” with wavy/textured hair."

With moptop hair dries faster, I get better definition and glossy clumps. My hair is 2c, fine but dense, dry, heavily highlighted. I really get beautiful results. It is pretty forgiving, as if you use too much, you can easily scrunch out the cast and it won't weight your hair down a bit...this is another big difference with kinky curly...with my hair type it is pretty much impossible to get volume with kinky curly custard, but I get ton of body with lots of movement with moptop custard. The only con is the high content of glycerin that causes frizz in the super humid, high dew points days we have here in Florida. In those days, I can't usually use moptop by itself as a solo styler, but I need to top it with a hard hold-no/low glycerin gel (great with AG liquid effects, or Biosilk hard rock gelee). Not a big deal, I still get the good definition and bounciness moptop gives."

I have wavy frizzy hair and this left my hair with almost totally frizz free, soft, bouncy curls. It definitely has a funky slimy texture with a strong fruity citrus smell but the smell dissipates as it dries.Pros:Adds shineSoft not crunchy curlsLightweightNatural ingredientsAffordableCons:Tames most frizz but not allOverall I am pleased to have this on hand. It is a much better alternative to the unhealthy ingredients I got from my previous gel. Still looking for something natural to completely tame my frizz without looking like a grease ball.UPDATE: After a few months of use I found that if I use a little more on top where I'm most prone to get frizz it will make a slight cast that I can break after it dries and then I'm frizz free! I just pull the locks through my fingers to unstiffen it until it looks natural.I'm also so impressed with how much volume I get with this. It doesn't weigh down my hair even though I add extra on top. Updating my rating to 5 stars. I use it daily after showering or to refresh curls. I still have plenty left. I'd guess with my medium length hair it will last at least 6 months. Great natural product and value!"

I kept getting fuzzy, frizzy, stringy, undefined curls and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Turns out, aloe is a problem for a lot of curlies. If your hair is instantly frizzing and losing it's ""clumpage"" when you add this gel, consider that your hair might not like aloe. Look up flash-drying.I don't want to give this product a bad rating just because I didn't know aloe wouldn't work with my hair. After all, it seems to work well for lots of people! I just hope this review helps someone else who is struggling with this gel and can't figure out why."

   This stuff is my new go-to! Wish i found it sooner.I’ve never been quite sure what the difference between gel and custard/jelly is — there are so many different types of products out there! But in my experience I’ve found custards and jellys to clump my hair nicely but not necessarily define them, and I’ve found them to leave my hair looking a little greasy and leaving a weird residue on them, whereas I’ve found gels to define and hold hair much better, but often leave it crunchy with lots of flyaways. Also, gels hold seems to be too strong and leaves a lot of my waves/curls misshapen. This product has a unique texture, not 100% like either gel or jelly (see video)My hair ranges from ‘s’ wave patterns to curls (mostly underneath.) The top is prone to extreme frizziness and just general “poof” and the front pieces that frame my face are prone to losing all wave pattern. This product seems to address all my hair concerns: manages frizz, boosts curl patterns where it’s needed, and holds pretty well without leaving a weird greasy residue.Overall I’d say this product is the perfect medium between jelly and gel! More hold than a jelly but less crunch than a gel. It smells great too and i like that it comes in a jar. I use a leave in conditioner/curl cream first and then use this product to scrunch my hair, let it dry, and I’m good to go.Hope this product helps someone struggling with their hair as much as it helped me! For the price you can’t go wrong giving it a chance— I’m so glad i did :)"

Great for curly, frizzy, wavy hair in any humidity","This stuff is great! It smells slightly citrusy but not sweet, a little like baby aspirin, lol, but the smell is nice and is not strong. The texture is hard to describe - it is thick and maybe best described like ""slime"" but not slimy. It is thick and luxurious. You will only need a little to apply to your hair; I have long, thick hair, and I use about two quarter size blobs. Run through wet or damp hair and comb through, fluff your curls and then leave your hair alone. You will find that your curls are well defined, moist, and not frizzy at all. The product can be a little stiff, but if you shake your hair out, the stiffness goes away. There is absolutely no flaking at all with this product. I am also allergic to a lot of gels and mousses (the perfumes cause scalp problems), but I have no problems with this product at all. I'm picky with hair products, and I've tried a million of them. I will buy this one again!"

I have wavy 2b hair, and ever since using this product I've noticed such a change in its texture and shine. I can go longer between wash days, which in turn means my hair is looking a lot healthier and shinier. My main concern when first buying this was that it wouldn't lather as well or that my hair wouldn't be as clean and I am so happy I was wrong. The lather is a little less voluminous than your standard bottle of shampoo but it will still keep your hair very clean without making it feel like straw. Aside from all of this, a major highlight of this shampoo is the bamboo scent. I have been asked by three to four people about this shampoo because of the smell alone.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger size ( please make a 16 oz. version!!). Highly recommend!"

Along with Curly Girl advice, I have kept my thinning strands from frizzing (thanks Mother Nature) using that mousse and conditioning with every wash.  But I was curious to try a curly hair custard and, on a whim, bought this.  I am so glad I did. This holds my large spiral pattern as well as my old mousse, but my hair looks fuller, feels bouncier and softer.  Like there's nothing weighing it down. And on day 2, I can spritz my hair with water, scrunch, and it perks right up again.  Trying that with the Garnier left my hair looking a little flat and dirty.A small amount does the trick on my shoulder length bob, applied by scrunching it thru fairly wet strands and then carefully drying with a diffuser.  The citrus scent is nice.  The price no longer bothers me because that container is going to last me awhile and the results can't be beat.  Highly recommend!"

But my curls just aren’t as full and I would have to completely re-do my hair daily if I didn’t want to just shove it in a bun. You know what I mean- totally wet it, work in fresh product, diffuse.....I have enough hair that that gets annoying.BUT with Mop Top I get out of the shower on day one and split my wet hair down the middle, over my shoulders, take a very small scoop of the goo and twist and finger brush it through each section. Then I flip my head, scrunch my hair and diffuse.I have noticed that a tiny bit of product goes a long way and it can get crunchy, but I solve that by just rolling my curls between my hands in sections to loosen the crunch and it’s perfect!Then, my favorite part about this product:I don’t wash my hair every day when I shower. I may go 3-4 days no wash. But like I said with my previous product: I would have to re-do the entire curly process if I wanted my hair done daily. NOT with Mop Top.

It foams up great and the bamboo essence scent is divine (it's a fresh, light scent with a hint of citrus). It cleans thoroughly, but like all sulfate free shampoos, there are some tricks to helping it clean properly. You must use LOTS of water...add more water, not more product, if you feel like you need more cleaning power. Also, let it sit just a bit longer than regular shampoo. After that it will leave your hair squeaky clean, with no scalp irritation from harsh sulfates. It does not dry my hair out."

That one ingredient limits it's usefulness for those of us that live in humid climates. Talking about frizz!! Companies really need to find a different humectant that is good for humidity. This product is a little pricey to have to put back in the cabinet to wait for the dew points to get into the right range to be able to use. Live and learn.

I have tried so many products so when I came across this stuff I was like Yes! I need to try it. Well the first time I applied it I didn't seem to put enough in my hair (it doesn't state how much to put in your hair so it's trial and error I guess). Before I used it the next time I searched You Tube I found the creators page and watched how she applied it. Well she put on tons it seemed. My hair is about 3 inches shorter and so I tried to adjust the amount. My hair came out crunchy and nothing like hers. Then later that night my hair looked like I had dandruff and my head itched the rest of the night. I should have washed my hair that night because my scalp itched all night. I got up first thing and washed my hair really good but it still itched. I don't think I'll try it again for that reason. I can't stand my scalp itching!

I take sections of my hair and mix together a cream and Jessicurl Spiralicious, apply to hair, and then I apply Mop Top. I brush each section with a Denman brush and smooth each section to encourage clumping. Then I scrunch the hell out of it and fix the wonky curls. I do that to every section and then diffuse until about 80% dry, and let air dry the rest of the way. I've used the rest of my products with a different gel, and definitely love the MopTop results better every time."

I was recommended to try this, but I couldn't find it in the local stores.  I purchased on Amazon, and it does work for my hair.  Makes it more curly and not all frizzy.  I don't have to use that much either, so this will last a good amount of time.  I do only wash twice a week though.  I just wish this wasn't so expensive, but I am willing to pay this being as it is so hard for me to find the right styling products for my hair!!UPDATE:  This worked great in the winter months but not doing all that good in the summer being as it has glycerin in this.

That is when I discovered that I have low porosity hair, and that the Deva curl gel is full of protein, which is not good for low porosity hair So, I went looking for something with minimal protein and found the Mop Top curly hair custard. I wasn't expecting much, because there are no curl holding chemicals in this gel, but I was very surprised to see that my hair was both fluffy and curly after just one little scoop (3 fingers) of gel. With Mop Top, less is more, so you don't need much. To refresh second day curls, just put a dash of gel and leave in conditioner in a small spray bottle with water. Spray and scrunch, and your curls will hold another day or two, even on fine hair. What I like the most is that this product never weighs down your hair. And it smells citrusy, which I like a lot."

Then I tried a MopTop sample kit and loved this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has the perfect consistency - not too thick but not too watery. For a low-poo it sudses up amazingly, and is easy to scrub into my scalp. I can tell it doesn't cleanse my scalp as well as my clarifying shampoo, but that is to be expected. I will use it 3 out of 4 washes to encourage the natural oils in my hair. It has a great balance of protein vs. moisture. And best of all is the scent - I didn't know bamboo could smell so good! It is an addicting sweet/fresh scent that makes me really look forward to wash days.

I add this right after leave-in and just before I apply a hard cast gel; I can literally feel it sucking the water into the core of my strands, and it takes my hair from dripping to just saturated with one application. Once all three products are applied, I throw my hair up into a microfiber turban until I can diffuse (for anyone that was curious about my post-wash routine).

Deva is great, but it's really expensive, plus you should change up your product occasionally to give your hair a rest.I shopped around, checked reviews, even tried some samples of a few brands, and MopTop products won the race by a mile! I'm currently using the no-poo cleansing conditioner, the daily conditioner, the leave-in conditioner, and the Curly Hair Custard. The custard was my first purchase and came with some samples from the rest of the line.I will say it works much better with a little extra moisture underneath. After conditioning (or cleansing and conditioning if it's ""wash"" day) I apply a tiny bit of the leave-in while still in the shower with SOAKING wet hair. Then I step out and apply a liberal amount of the Curly Custard, being sure to flip upside-down and side-to-side. Then scrunch scrunch scrunch. I let it air dry then loosen the cast once it's completely dry. This can also be done with a diffuser, but I don't have time for blow dryers. I find I see a lot more frizz if I skip the leave-in."

Didn't provide any better results than lesser expensive products I can buy at my local retail outlet. I bought this because it is natural and minus the sulfates, which can dry out and damage hair and scalp. My scalp has been dry for some time and I have psoriasis, which does flare up from time to time., especially when my scalp is dry. I also changed shampoos at the same time, using a cleansing conditoner free of sulfates.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't really made a difference. Additonally, it tends to create a slightly crispy texture in my hair.  This will probably not be the experience for most people as I have very, very kinky, frizzy curly hair. Although each folicle is very fine, I have a lot of it, and WITH the extreme curl, it often feels almost coarse.I am Scotch Irish and just have crazier hair than most people here buying this product. However, if you share my genetic predisposition, please understand that this may not work for you either.That all being said, the product came well packaged and smells really nice.

Research suggested that hair similar to mine benefits most from lightweight, moisturizing products. I ended up focusing more on using a lower number of moisturizing products instead of multiple lightweight products. I've used As I Am Leave In Conditioner for my dry hair since before I started this hair journey but decided to ditch it if I'm going to add on a curl activator/enhancer/gel. I tried Cantu Curl Activator, which did almost nothing to define my waves and made my hair more frizzy. I tried Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie which did help enhance my waves (not in the back though), provided decent moisture, reduced some frizz, but did not have much hold- next day waves were basically not a thing and frizz was back. Adding in Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel gave me almost no hold (Upon purchasing I didn't realize it was a light hold gel) and was very drying so I ditched that quickly and replaced it with Eco Style Gel (strong hold gel). It did help with definition and hold all around, not drying, but it wasn't optimal. I moved on to Aunt Jackie's Defining Curl Custard and no gel which impressed me with the moisture, decent hold, reduced frizz, and enhanced definition even in the 2A back of my hair- but it contains silicones that I knew would eventually weigh down my hair. Mop Top Curly Hair Custard Gel had been on my list of CGM approved products to try and I should've gone with it ages ago because this product goes beyond Aunt Jackie's. I have defined waves all around, equal hold, and it is moisturizing. I've gotten the best defined next day waves compared to all other products I've tried. With other/no products, my halo frizz is usually worse the second and third day- but even with humectants being predominant in this product, I have had no halo frizz. I usually get frizz in both dry and humid environments, I have not yet had a chance to test it on a sufficiently humid day. I am optimistic though."

Finally a good hair curl product!!!,"When I was younger I had super straight hair.  Seriously!  Sometimes I had to perm it twice (it was the 80's when spiral perms were ""in"") just to get the curls to stick.  Over the years my hair has evolved and it has slowly developed major frizz.  However, recently I've discovered that when tamed, that frizz is actually waves/curls!  I've purchased some creams and mousses recently to make the most out of my curls, but all of the products I've tried have always resulted in tacky-to-the-touch, frizzy and crunchy stiff hair.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos and some of the ladies raved about this product and their curls did look lovely so I thought I'd by a jar and give it a try.  My jar arrived today and tonight I tried it.  It's AMAZING!!!  I towel dried my hair and applied this product to my damp hair.  This ""custard"" is runny but a little goes a long way so it didn't take much to cover my thin/fine hair.  I loved that it wasn't tacky and cause my hair to stick to my hand when I applied it.  I let my hair air-dry and I was happy to see that every time I checked on it, my curls were curling and there wasn't any frizz in sight!  When my hair was about  75% dry, I decided to defuse it and really give it the frizz test.  Once again... no frizz and my curls were even more prominent!  I've been disappointed by so many products over the years so I am so incredibly happy to find a hair product that surpassed my expectations!  I'm new to MopTop hair products but I'll definitely be giving other MopTop products a try in the future.I highly recommend this product."

Thankfully Kinky Curly was out of stock. I washed my hair and applied Moptop and went outside in the hot sun and did yardwork. Sweating profusely. Most of my hair dried though! I pulled and stretched out the curls and still have good definition. Going out for a walk with temp still 86f. Will see how good of a hold I keep. That is always a challenge for me though.

This has been my go to product for a couples yrs now after being natural.The texture is of this product is of a Gooey, slime gel, I rub it in with little effort & just really allow it to air dry or sometimes w/the use of a hand dryer.The curls are just truly defined, as I get compliments & request for my product use all the time.It’s a bit pricey but the product results are worth it."

I went from frizz to happy curls in a matter of a few washes. It's difficult to keep my hair moisturized out here in the dry desert, so it's so satisfying to see happy hair after years of struggling with Hagrid hair.The only downfall was the packaging. The bottles were just thrown in a paper sack with a little bit of tape on their lids. Unfortunately the shampoo opened and I lost a good amount of shampoo."

It smells like nailpolish remover, and while it feels rather slimy or oily going on, it leaves my hair extremely dry. An hour after application, my hair looks like a frazzled mess that hasn't been conditioned in ages. The weird chemical smell lingers and is pretty unbearable, too. Hair feels somehow both dry and greasy (!) to the touch.I have wavy 2b/2c hair and this might work for other types, even though this type of product usually works quite well for me, so I really just think it's this particular brand.I see other reviews saying that the product sold on Amazon might have gone bad or is not comparable to the product you can buy elsewhere. Maybe that's the problem? Either way, I strongly recommend you don't order this for your hair!"

I have mulitextured hair ranging from 2b to 3a. It's fine to medium and medium density. The Moptop custard does not weigh my hair down at all and it doesn't leave a productly film I often get from other products. It definitely enhances my texture and gives me volume. I do have to top it off with another product for additional hold but that doesn't bother me...this stuff is holy grail for me.

It has shine and softness again.  No other deep conditioner has worked this effectively.  This morning I used Quidad moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (blue line), then It's a 10 leave-in + keratin (orange top) spray onto drenched curls, and easily finger-combed the Mop Top curl custard through, and scrunched several times.  Plopped my hair up in terry turban, while completing other tasks worth about 5-7 minutes. Removed towel and clipped roots up.  Once dry enough, removed clips.  My hair looked so good all work day.  Left a light gel cast, similar to Devacurl gel, until I manually loosened them up.  Then the hair was soft and even more shiny.  This product is a must if you have over dry curls."

I’m a guy with medium length mixed 3a/c curls and most specialty products targeted at my hair type are either too heavy or too drying. Have spent hundreds of dollars on product over the past two years. Nothing I’ve tried before has been this good.Hold, moisture, and shine all in one product. No need to layer product for my hair. Routine since purchasing: Co-Wash with a cheap CG-approved conditioner, glide pick through hair, rinse, apply glob of Mop Top root to end, air dry and forget about it."

I am using mostly the As I Am product line but they lack a true conditioner. I tried this conditioner to add moisture to my hair. While it does that and makes it very soft. It adds a lot of weight to my hair and adds to the frizzy. But if you are looking for moisture this is a great product.

I have 3B curls, and it really leaves my hair soft and bouncy, people stop me in my tracks to ask what I use.  Love the light cast it leaves once it dries, which I massage out to take my look to a soft non crunchy look.  I also love that there isn't a heavy scent - it's just right and fades away once dry. I hope the company keeps using the jar because that;'s the easiest way to style my curls, I just hate it when companies switch their products to bottles."

As mentioned in another review, this is so strongly scented as to exclude one from many public places. The curly custard smelt strongly of citrus, but the leave in, I’m sorry to have to say, smells chemical and just nasty. I know other people have said it smells great, so each to their own. Btw, I’m not smell sensitive, and have never complained about scent before. Jsyk."

The barcode/info sticker looked like it had gotten wet at some point. However the contents of the container appear to be in good condition.Performance: nice texture to the gel, applies easily, smells good, dries relatively quickly. Decent amount of hold but more difficult to completely break the cast than Kinky Curly custard. Does have a lot of glycerin in it so it is not good in the summer humidity. My normally minimally frizzy 2b wavy hair looked poodle-esk after only a few minutes out air conditioning. I also had some white flaking as it apparently interacts with Miss Jessie’s  curl cream.Overall it’s an okay purchase if it’s not humid outside and I’m in a hurry to leave the house with dry hair. I think it will be more of a winter product and will update back."

Everything else has too much protein, or too much oil for my hair, leaving it dry and brittle. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it. This moisturizes very well, but never leaves my hair weighed down or greasy. It actually gets into my hair shaft, rather then just sitting on top! I have tried so many conditioners, and can not handle chemical smells. This is scented with citrus essenial oils, and the smell does not linger. It is also a very pure, natural product, which is very important to me. I am very grateful to mop top for making such a wonderful product. If not for this, my poor hair would be dry as a dessert. Don't ever stop making it!"

It burns when you wash hair. And then a day later I got an unbearable sharp pain in my eyes that I could not open them because it felt like knife is cutting right through them. It took me a few episodes to understand what was causing that pain a day later after the wash. Stopped using a product and the pain did not come back. Never buying any of Moptop products again!

Frankly, this would probably be my favorite product of all time if it weren't for the sickly-sweet and overpowering scent that just reminds me of cheap sugary products. I don't smell the ""citrus"" at all. I used it this morning and although the scent has faded over time, my headache that came from it is still lingering. If there's an unscented version of this product, I'd jump on it without hesitation. As is, though, I wouldn't buy it again."

Used this tonight for the first time during squish to condish, after applying a leave in. I used maybe 3 quarter sizes worth of product and I did not use any gel, because after reading the reviews I was really curious to see what it would do on its own. It did create a *little bit* of a cast.My hair looks great, however next time I'll use a little more product and see what happens. And then I'll try a bit of gel with it, and report back. So far I am very happy with this product."

Please Read,"I tried to give this product the benefit of the doubt. I even tried it for a full 3 months. However, the smell and quality is absolutely horrendous. If you like smelling like candied coconut mixed with playdough...you'll love this scent! I had to spray hairspray or perfume on my head anytime I conditioned with this. Not only that, it left the most residue and buildup in my hair I've ever had. Let me remind you, I used this for 3 months, not changing any other products and this conditioner made my hair greasy, stringy, and smelling like a literal child covered in playdough. Honestly, the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life."

Her hair is fairly wavy but before Mop Top it just looked messy so I always put it up in pony tails.  I got recommended a bunch of products but was looking for a more affordable option for my 4 year old.  I really like this stuff.  It smells great (so good that I use it in my hair to keep down my fly always because of the nice scent!).  It helps define her curls in the morning.  We hair wash at night, so by morning her hair is just a wavy bed head mess.  All I really need is this Mop Top stuff, although sometimes I do a detangler or mousse.  But I've found Mop Top is all I really need to make her hair presentable to wear curly."

I hate stuff that leaves my hair feeling dirty or heavy! I'm so glad I took the leap! I made my mom try it (who never does anything with her hair) and it made her hair so much healthier looking... and brought the curls out so nicely!

I've tried other custards and a flaxseed gel with the same consistency and it just isn't my thing. I have fine hair, and used this at the beginning of my CG transistion, so it was kind of a 2a-2b wave. The product was nice for a wash-and-wear, one product look. It also smells like Sprite to me, which is a pleasant and not over powering smell. Unlike some custards, it didn't make my hair look stringy if I used a little too much. I gave what I had left to a friend with coarser, 3b-3c hair and she likes it as a wash-and-wear as well."

I really like it for both of our hair. It actually leaves my daughter's fine hair kind of plumped. If you leave it in awhile, it deeply moisturizes and feels almost like buttery smooth. Yet still is so light, unlike butters and oils that weigh hair down.  It's keeping my 2B waves much more bouncy as oppose to some of the heavier butter like cowashing I did in the past.  I plan to use this for my daily conditioner."

I’m a loyal Deva Curl user for many years but my curly hair is getting looser the older I get, and a good product is needed more than ever to alleviate frizz and define curl. The smell is a mild citrus, very tolerable, and the texture appears water soluble and blended well into my damp hair. No residue and dried slightly crisp which I could somewhat shake out. However I prefer a stronger hold, especially as the day wears on in humidity. The key is to leave your hair alone when you apply product and that’s always a challenge. With Deva, I combine several different products to get good hold. This one does it all by itself. I’m very pleased so far."

I bought a tub of it back in September 2018 and I just finally ran out in May 2019. Coming on here to order more made me realize I should leave a review! A little bit of this goes a long way and you really don't need to use more than a nickel to quarter size amount depending on how much hair you have. Too much will actually cause you to end up with flakes so definitely start cautiously until you figure your perfect amount out. The photo I attached has the wash day before I received this product not using any curl activators on the left and then the wash adding this product into my line-up on the right. I think it's pretty obvious that it works!

I used this product alone and it worked fine. It does leave a crunchy cast which is good for wavy/curly girls to maintain a curl pattern. I scrunch it out later if I air dry or even after I diffuse. I have never used a hair custard before. A little goes a looong way which is good for the price. It feels like the slim I used to play with as a little girl, and the smell is nice and citrusy.

I was putting MT over my B'Leave In and the results were good but not great. I used it alone and BAM! I had to die for curls. What works for me is to coat my hair, scrunch and plop for 30 minutes and then diffuse without touching my hair at high heat high speed until 80% dry, then go for the roots at medium heat/speed, then finish on the ends.

Amazon was sold out of my usual gel last time, so I ordered this instead. It does an okay job holding curls together (similar to other nice gels I've tried) and only causes a moderate amount of ""crispiness"" in areas where you apply too much. The thing that I can't stand about this gel is the horrible smell! It smells like chemicals to me. I even had my boyfriend comment on the weird smell when my hair was wet.

However it is NOT great for fine curls. I've been looking everywhere for a good gel for fine curls, and this did say that it was in the description, but it isn't. It left my hair sticky and stringy and with frizz and fly-aways for days. Also, no matter how little I used, there was no scrunching out the crunch. It just stayed crunchy even after diffusing.

My only complaint is that the amount is 8oz, and I wish I could find it in a 12 or 16 oz container bc I must use a lotttttttt of it. I use a hard hold over it bc it doesn't give me a ton of hold, but I always have to use a gel on top of any styler. Gel alone doesn't give me the definition I desire. THIS does!!! Highly recommend!!"

Interested to try more mop top items now."

Now I’m co-washing with it most wash days but I still need to use about twice as much as normal so the bottle is not lasting long.

This custard does a great job at defining curls and limiting frizz. I have dry, 3B hair and I use about a tablespoon of this product each time I have a wash day.

I have very straight, fine, thinning hair that is going through changes due to hormones. It doesn't dry out my scalp, has a lovely, light scent that isn't overpowering at all, especially since I don't usually buy scented things due to allergies. It's great for my kids' hair too, although it stings if it gets in their eyes. My friend with thick, lushious hair (on the oily side) mentioned it didn't rinse out of her hair well, but I love the extra moisture."

It's my favorite gel for my 3a(ish) hair. I use it in combination with a curl cream, because my hair is thick and needs a lot of moisture, but this product can be a one-step curl routine for finer hair. I like it better than Deva Curl gel. It has better hold and does some special slip action that is very moisturizing and unique to the product. I also like the way it sculpts my curls a little bit more than the Deva gels. I love the definition I get from this product. Although you use a generous amount, I wouldn't load it on too thick, because it is fairly strong. You need to be kind of sparing when reapplying on second day hair--I would recommend not reapplying to the whole head. My only criticism is that it can create slightly more buildup than other lighter gels, like Deva. The smell is citrusy and lovely. The ingredients are VERY clean. Buy, buy, buy."

This stuff is fantastic. I have very dry, thick wavy/curly hair, and it gets weighted down and looks unhealthy. This custard leaves my hair soft and gives me defined curls to even the most stubborn strands of hair that just look frizzy. I've been applying it to wet hair, letting it dry for an hour, and then diffuse. I need to add just a tiny bit more after diffusing to tame flyaways, but that's it. I typically laugh at products that claim you need a quarter sized amount - that's such a load of garbage for anyone with longer, thick hair. But this stuff....you do not need a lot to go along way! This custard has replaced 2 other products that I no longer need in my routine. I'm super happy so far!!!!!!!!!"

When I took the lid off, I could see that the issue was the seal. It was broken. Bummmmmed. Hoping it works well though, after all the hype 🤙🏻"

After letting that go, I tried it on my wet hair in the shower without gel and it did the opposite of what I was expecting, my hair just puffed up like there was no moisture in it. I tried it the second time the following week and put light gel over it and it weighed down everything. Do not get this product if you have high porosity 2a-3a hair, it is worthless and overpriced."

I have fine 2b/2c hair and this works great. It doesn't weigh my hair down and a little goes a long way. However, I do use this under a gel.

It has the perfect hold that doesn't completely freeze your hair, but still holds. The only issue I have found is that if you aren't careful about evenly distributing this gel, it will clump up and dry into white crusty chunks in your hair. So just be sue to finger comb it through your hair very thoroughly before you scrunch it."

This does not so it doesn't work if used alone for me. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I need the cast for my hair to hold up for 2nd or 3rd day hair. If it's too soft on 1st day hair, it wont hold up. HOWEVER, this product is still GREAT! It adds great definition to your curls and it is very forgiving if you use too much. If you like soft touch hold with defined curls, then this is for you. I actually combine it with another gel. I first use it on really damp hair as a ""primer"" and then finish off with the devacurl arc angel ultra hold gel. I don't have to use nearly as much devacurl gel and the combination of both products give me great definition. I will be purchasing it again."

I had previously tried the Ouai wave spray, and most recently, Devacurls wavemaker, but wasn't super impressed with the results. This is seriously a game changer. From the moment I put it on my hair, all the curls sprung up. I use a quarter size amount, and top it with some LA Looks flex-hold gel for extra definition. I diffuse and my hair is super voluminous and bouncy."

Instead, I'm just trying to use it up by applying to the bottom layer of my hair and using something else on the top. If you have curls like mine, I highly recommend AG Hair Cosmetics Curl Trigger Defining Spray. It's a little pricy but so great at forming curls without weighing them down."

The very first time I washed with this shampoo, I noticed that large sections of my scalp were covered in flaking skin. This was mostly an issue around my crown and forehead area. It was the strangest thing; the flaking would begin immediately after use (noticeable even under wet hair) and continue to get worse for the day or two after washing. After the hair dried, it would begin to itch and continue to get itchier as time passed. I'm not sure if it was just dry flaky skin or if it was actual dandruff, but the amount of whatever it was was astonishing (and gross).I stopped using the shampoo after about a week, and my problems stopped then, but I've used it a couple of times since (when I was desperate and out of other shampoos) and had the same problem. It's super weird but I haven't heard of anyone else having the same issue. Other than that, it smelled good and did a fine job washing my actual hair, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else experiences something similar."

I use a denman brush when I wash my hair, then I scrunch this into wet hair on top of homemade flax seed gel.  I only used a nickel sized amount on my thin hair which is just past my shoulders.  My curls were popping like never before!  It does have glycerin but it's winter now so it works great 4 me.  Not sure how well it will work in the humid summer because of the glycerin.I see some reviewers complained about this gel making their hair crunchy but keep in mind you're supposed to scrunch the hardness out of your hair in order to get soft curls.  Other reviewers complained of flaking but this wasn't an issue for me as i used on wet hair and did not mess with my curls after they dried and I ""scrunched out the crunch"".  Maybe ""scrunching out the crunch"" with some light oil would help with that?  Anyway, I give this stuff 2 thumbs up!"

The shampoo was too moisturizing for my hair and the conditioner was ridiculously too oily for my hair. I had a film of oil on my hair and mybody after I tried rinsing it out, so I had to go back and rewash with my regular shampoo. I do not recommend this forsoft fine hair, but I think it would be great for course dry hair."

It feels like that sugar body scrub you use.  I put some on my damp hair.  It will hold some of the curl in, but when it dries it turns hard like glue then starts to flake.  Compared to Ampro gel, which is much cheaper, I like Ampro better.  Ampro will smooth out my hair and make it straighter as it is holding it down.  Plus when it dries, it is not hard as glue, comes out easy and does not damage hair.  Ampro does very little flaking as well.  Back to that,"

I tried this several times and it was way too heavy for my hair. So, I got the idea of diluting a little with water, so that I could put it in a squeeze bottle and apply to my hair. It works great. My curls look as good with this product as any other curl enhancer that I have used.  I use a few pumps of deva curl ultra defining gel on top."

It doesn’t perform as well as I hoped. Compared to my other leave-ins which are the Kinky Curly Knot Today and the Shea Moisture silicone-free miracle treatment, it just doesn’t penetrate my hair strands as much and i gel it sort of sits on top of my hair. I also have to apply a lot of it to get any sort of effect. I don’t think I will be reaching for this product often."

But this one, man oh man! I am glad that I found this product!!!! I’ve always tried curly hair girl approved products , but they always weight down my curls and my hair gets super frizzy even though I diffuse. I don’t diffuse at all , so it would make me upset that even though I diffuse my hair would still get super frizzy! I would try so many methods and nothing! However, this product , I recently purchased the sample packets off their Instagram page. And I am so happy that I finally found a product that does justice to my hair!!!! Thank you, thank you!

Turns out it wasn’t for me. I like no-crunch custard and this leaves my hair dry, frizzy and crunchy.  And if I put it in my hair a little too much, it leaves some white flakes. I live in East Asia so maybe the climate can be one of the reason why it’s not doing the work? Anyhow I would recommend this for someone who likes crunchy strong hold gel, but I wouldn’t personally buy it again."

I’ve used it twice so far and am just not impressed. It works okay... but it doesn’t have as much slip as I hoped so it’s hard to finger detangle my hair. It does clean my hair but I feel it is stripping away some moisture. When I compare it to the other Co-wash I own, which is the AS I AM Coconut cowash, it doesn’t perform as well."

It glides through my curly hair nicely,"This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely, and helps keep the curl controlled as my hair dries.  Does not make my hair frizzy.  It smells nice, sweet like some kind of candy.  The reason for 2 stars is the bottle it comes in.  The product itself is pretty thick, like pudding.  It does not flow.  The plastic bottle it's in is thick hard plastic. It's ridiculously difficult to squeeze a thick, pudding-like product out of a narrow-necked stiff plastic bottle.  If you take the cap off you can ""shake"" it out, which is what I do, but it's not ideal considering that sometimes it shakes out a huge glob bigger than you need, which is a hassle again to scrape the excess back in.  The directions for use on the bottle state in bold letters, ""shake well"".  Lol, how do you shake this product well, especially when the bottle is brand new and filled to the top, and for what purpose?  Does the product separate as it sits it something.  No.  I just think there must be a lot of people in the company who don't understand the product or use it themselves.  The product would be better contained in a jar with a lid that you can dip your fingers into, or maybe a soft squeezable tube that can be stored upside down.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It doesn't seem like the manufacturer understands its own product. It's not exactly a bargain price either."

I like the gentle shampoo because it cleaned my hair without stripping all the natural oils.  The deep conditioner didn't give me the same kind of slip for detangling as the the daily conditioner, but it did what it said it would do.  The leave it in conditioner gave my hair a light hold like a gel without the crunchy hardness of a gel.  It also left my hair soft and smooth.  I will for sure buy the leave it in conditioner and the gentle shampoo again.  I gave this review a 4 not 5 stars because the deep conditioner doesn't have the same slip as the daily conditioner.  The daily conditioner is the best conditioner for slip I have every used.  If you have frizzy curly hair these products are awesome.  It costs more, but these products are very high in and they work.  I have kinky curly hair and I love these products.  BTW it your hair is protein sensitive don't use the deep conditioner more then once a week."

I applied a generous amount of this product to a section of my hair last nite and my curls were still a bit crunchy. I thought that maybe I had product build up in my hair so I shampooed my hair today and re-applied a generous amount again to my entire hair and my curls were still a bit crunchy and stiff so I decided to ponytail my hair and leave a few strands out. This product smells amazing but didn’t give me the moist curls & softness as described. I’ll come back and give y’all an overall honest review once the entire bottle is done and I’ve sampled it on several styles.

The consistency is both thinner and a bit stickier than what I've been used to, but it's working for me just as well.  For context, my hair is naturally wavy/curly when short.  After washing I apply a small dab of leave-in conditioner, then use the custard, push into shape with my fingers and air dry.I have bits of hair on the side of my head that are a little stubborn with trying to curl the wrong direction and this holds them in place.  Which is good considering I've been resorting to at-home covid-cuts lol."

My hair is suuuuper thick, coarse, and I have a lot of it. It's curly/wavy but I know some little curls are hidden in there! The best method I found for me was to bring it with me in the shower, and after I rinse my conditioner out with cold water, I put a generous amount of this in my hair with my head upside down with a crunching motion. Try it! All in all I do love it and I may buy it again once I run out, unless I find something even better!"

However, it has no preservatives in it and can actually “go bad” if it sits to long. I usually get it from my hair salon, but found it here on amazon and decided to order it. When it arrived, the tubs were wrapped in additional plastic (which is different from the salon) and the safety seal was missing. The thing that bothered me though was the color, consistency and smell of the product. It is supposed to smell wonderful (somewhat sweet but not overpowering) with a light opal color the consistency of thick honey. This was fowl smelling, runny and darker than it was supposed to be. Long story long, great product but buy it at a store so you can check it’s color!"
1,"﻿MopTop Curl Enhancer Gel, Reduces Frizz, Natural Ingredients, Kinky-Coily Curly Hair Gel, Made w/ ﻿Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey, (﻿Citrus Medley, 8oz)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Staple product, consistent results.","This is one of my staple products. I have 2B, low porosity, fine-medium strands, high density hair. This custard smells great and is very concentrated, ensure you emulsify well when applying.  Custards don’t typically provide a lot of hold but I do think this product has a good amount of hold on its own. I typically use it on wash days but have used it to refresh and it will revive and hold my waves. Product smells great, citrusy like a Kumquat but the smell unfortunately will not linger (I personally would love to smell like this product all day long). The product does contain protein and glycerin. It has held up well even in humidity despite the glycerin content. This is likely because I DO layer this product with 2 other stylers that I think are a great combination and compliment each other superbly. I use the Uncle Funky’s Daughter Curl Magic as a base, Moptop Curl Custard second, and seal the deal with Jessie Curl Spiralicious. In the pictures my hair looks wet/shiny, but it is fully dry FYI.In case you are wondering I use a cowash, As I Am 2 out of my 3 weekly wash days and clarify with Bounce Curl Clarifying Shampoo, and condition with Bounce Curl Super Smooth conditioner.I went crazy buying a bunch of products when I transitioned to embracing my natural hair, but hands down this product with the combination I mentioned above is a definite winner for my hair type. As you can see, I was so confident in my line-up that I went out to my first dressy outing sporting my natural hair for the first time since my transition and I was not disappointed. It gave me such confidence to know you can look “put together” with wavy/textured hair."

With moptop hair dries faster, I get better definition and glossy clumps. My hair is 2c, fine but dense, dry, heavily highlighted. I really get beautiful results. It is pretty forgiving, as if you use too much, you can easily scrunch out the cast and it won't weight your hair down a bit...this is another big difference with kinky curly...with my hair type it is pretty much impossible to get volume with kinky curly custard, but I get ton of body with lots of movement with moptop custard. The only con is the high content of glycerin that causes frizz in the super humid, high dew points days we have here in Florida. In those days, I can't usually use moptop by itself as a solo styler, but I need to top it with a hard hold-no/low glycerin gel (great with AG liquid effects, or Biosilk hard rock gelee). Not a big deal, I still get the good definition and bounciness moptop gives."

It definitely has a funky slimy texture with a strong fruity citrus smell but the smell dissipates as it dries.Pros:Adds shineSoft not crunchy curlsLightweightNatural ingredientsAffordableCons:Tames most frizz but not allOverall I am pleased to have this on hand. It is a much better alternative to the unhealthy ingredients I got from my previous gel. Still looking for something natural to completely tame my frizz without looking like a grease ball.UPDATE: After a few months of use I found that if I use a little more on top where I'm most prone to get frizz it will make a slight cast that I can break after it dries and then I'm frizz free! I just pull the locks through my fingers to unstiffen it until it looks natural.I'm also so impressed with how much volume I get with this. It doesn't weigh down my hair even though I add extra on top. Updating my rating to 5 stars. I use it daily after showering or to refresh curls. I still have plenty left. I'd guess with my medium length hair it will last at least 6 months. Great natural product and value!"

I kept getting fuzzy, frizzy, stringy, undefined curls and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Turns out, aloe is a problem for a lot of curlies. If your hair is instantly frizzing and losing it's ""clumpage"" when you add this gel, consider that your hair might not like aloe. Look up flash-drying.I don't want to give this product a bad rating just because I didn't know aloe wouldn't work with my hair. After all, it seems to work well for lots of people! I just hope this review helps someone else who is struggling with this gel and can't figure out why."

But in my experience I’ve found custards and jellys to clump my hair nicely but not necessarily define them, and I’ve found them to leave my hair looking a little greasy and leaving a weird residue on them, whereas I’ve found gels to define and hold hair much better, but often leave it crunchy with lots of flyaways. Also, gels hold seems to be too strong and leaves a lot of my waves/curls misshapen. This product has a unique texture, not 100% like either gel or jelly (see video)My hair ranges from ‘s’ wave patterns to curls (mostly underneath.) The top is prone to extreme frizziness and just general “poof” and the front pieces that frame my face are prone to losing all wave pattern. This product seems to address all my hair concerns: manages frizz, boosts curl patterns where it’s needed, and holds pretty well without leaving a weird greasy residue.Overall I’d say this product is the perfect medium between jelly and gel! More hold than a jelly but less crunch than a gel. It smells great too and i like that it comes in a jar. I use a leave in conditioner/curl cream first and then use this product to scrunch my hair, let it dry, and I’m good to go.Hope this product helps someone struggling with their hair as much as it helped me! For the price you can’t go wrong giving it a chance— I’m so glad i did :)"

Great for curly, frizzy, wavy hair in any humidity","This stuff is great! It smells slightly citrusy but not sweet, a little like baby aspirin, lol, but the smell is nice and is not strong. The texture is hard to describe - it is thick and maybe best described like ""slime"" but not slimy. It is thick and luxurious. You will only need a little to apply to your hair; I have long, thick hair, and I use about two quarter size blobs. Run through wet or damp hair and comb through, fluff your curls and then leave your hair alone. You will find that your curls are well defined, moist, and not frizzy at all. The product can be a little stiff, but if you shake your hair out, the stiffness goes away. There is absolutely no flaking at all with this product. I am also allergic to a lot of gels and mousses (the perfumes cause scalp problems), but I have no problems with this product at all. I'm picky with hair products, and I've tried a million of them. I will buy this one again!"
11,"﻿MopTop Curl Enhancer Gel, Reduces Frizz, Natural Ingredients, Kinky-Coily Curly Hair Gel, Made w/ ﻿Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey, (﻿Citrus Medley, 8oz)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Changing Shampoo!!,"This is the second or third sulfate-free shampoo that I've ever tried and I love it! I have wavy 2b hair, and ever since using this product I've noticed such a change in its texture and shine. I can go longer between wash days, which in turn means my hair is looking a lot healthier and shinier. My main concern when first buying this was that it wouldn't lather as well or that my hair wouldn't be as clean and I am so happy I was wrong. The lather is a little less voluminous than your standard bottle of shampoo but it will still keep your hair very clean without making it feel like straw. Aside from all of this, a major highlight of this shampoo is the bamboo scent. I have been asked by three to four people about this shampoo because of the smell alone.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger size ( please make a 16 oz. version!!). Highly recommend!"

Liquids are too light and don't offer enough slip, and creams are too heavy and leave my waves/curls weighed down. This one is just right! It looks like a thick cream but it goes on very light. I apply it from my ears down and it leaves me with bouncy, moist curls. I adore the bamboo essence scent, which is very light and fresh with a slight citrus smell to it."

I use this over the Shea Moisture Miracle Leave In Styler and I get the most beautiful results.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny and does really well in humid weather.  And you cant beat the price.  I was using DevaCurls Ultra Defining gel for a while but that would leave my hair looking extra dry on day 2 and 3 hair.  With the MopTop my hair looks and feels great for days without needing much refreshing."

Can't use it in high humidity nor in really low humidity so it is really limited to early Spring and maybe fall, or at least it is here in the South. It is sitting in the back of my cabinet waiting on dew points to get into the correct range. Would rather buy something that can be used year round!"

Along with Curly Girl advice, I have kept my thinning strands from frizzing (thanks Mother Nature) using that mousse and conditioning with every wash.  But I was curious to try a curly hair custard and, on a whim, bought this.  I am so glad I did. This holds my large spiral pattern as well as my old mousse, but my hair looks fuller, feels bouncier and softer.  Like there's nothing weighing it down. And on day 2, I can spritz my hair with water, scrunch, and it perks right up again.  Trying that with the Garnier left my hair looking a little flat and dirty.A small amount does the trick on my shoulder length bob, applied by scrunching it thru fairly wet strands and then carefully drying with a diffuser.  The citrus scent is nice.  The price no longer bothers me because that container is going to last me awhile and the results can't be beat.  Highly recommend!"

I had previously ordered a sample packet from moptop directly and LOVED the conditioner. I ordered through amazon because I had a credit on my account. The product I received was packaged well and sealed, but the conditioner does NOT perform anything close to the sample. The real conditioner detangles my hair and has a great slip to it, what I received doesn’t help detangle at all. Super disappointed."

It lathers up quite a bit!  I use it several times a week. I follow the curly girl method but  I found that co-washing is just way too much oil for my fine 2B waves so I use this shampoo (and moptop's light conditioner).  I prefer this for my daughters fine, straight hair too. I used this and the light conditioner on it and her hair is the best it's ever been..everything at the store is too heavy or left her hair staticky.  this is the perfect combo"

But my curls just aren’t as full and I would have to completely re-do my hair daily if I didn’t want to just shove it in a bun. You know what I mean- totally wet it, work in fresh product, diffuse.....I have enough hair that that gets annoying.BUT with Mop Top I get out of the shower on day one and split my wet hair down the middle, over my shoulders, take a very small scoop of the goo and twist and finger brush it through each section. Then I flip my head, scrunch my hair and diffuse.I have noticed that a tiny bit of product goes a long way and it can get crunchy, but I solve that by just rolling my curls between my hands in sections to loosen the crunch and it’s perfect!Then, my favorite part about this product:I don’t wash my hair every day when I shower. I may go 3-4 days no wash. But like I said with my previous product: I would have to re-do the entire curly process if I wanted my hair done daily. NOT with Mop Top. A few sprays with a water bottle to reform the bed head (not even enough worth diffuse drying) and boom! My hair looks like day one! For all three days! No extra product! I love it!This tub of goo will last forever!The photo I’m posting is day THREE!"

It foams up great and the bamboo essence scent is divine (it's a fresh, light scent with a hint of citrus). It cleans thoroughly, but like all sulfate free shampoos, there are some tricks to helping it clean properly. You must use LOTS of water...add more water, not more product, if you feel like you need more cleaning power. Also, let it sit just a bit longer than regular shampoo. After that it will leave your hair squeaky clean, with no scalp irritation from harsh sulfates. It does not dry my hair out."

That one ingredient limits it's usefulness for those of us that live in humid climates. Talking about frizz!! Companies really need to find a different humectant that is good for humidity. This product is a little pricey to have to put back in the cabinet to wait for the dew points to get into the right range to be able to use. Live and learn.

I have tried so many products so when I came across this stuff I was like Yes! I need to try it. Well the first time I applied it I didn't seem to put enough in my hair (it doesn't state how much to put in your hair so it's trial and error I guess). Before I used it the next time I searched You Tube I found the creators page and watched how she applied it. Well she put on tons it seemed. My hair is about 3 inches shorter and so I tried to adjust the amount. My hair came out crunchy and nothing like hers. Then later that night my hair looked like I had dandruff and my head itched the rest of the night. I should have washed my hair that night because my scalp itched all night. I got up first thing and washed my hair really good but it still itched. I don't think I'll try it again for that reason. I can't stand my scalp itching!

I've been doing the Curly Girl Method since May '18, and have used a lot of different products...but i haven't come across any better gel than this. I have 2c/3a/3b waves/curls, and this stuff helps define everything. Very strong hold (I need that for my hair) but once I ""scrunch out the crunch"" it leaves very soft hair.I wash my hair with Not Your Mother's curl defining shampoo and conditioner (pink bottles) and style with very wet hair. I take sections of my hair and mix together a cream and Jessicurl Spiralicious, apply to hair, and then I apply Mop Top. I brush each section with a Denman brush and smooth each section to encourage clumping. Then I scrunch the hell out of it and fix the wonky curls. I do that to every section and then diffuse until about 80% dry, and let air dry the rest of the way. I've used the rest of my products with a different gel, and definitely love the MopTop results better every time."

I started doing my hair with the curly girl method about three months ago, and it was doing better. I just couldn't find the right styling product that didn't have silicone and sulfate in it.  I was recommended to try this, but I couldn't find it in the local stores.  I purchased on Amazon, and it does work for my hair.  Makes it more curly and not all frizzy.  I don't have to use that much either, so this will last a good amount of time.  I do only wash twice a week though.  I just wish this wasn't so expensive, but I am willing to pay this being as it is so hard for me to find the right styling products for my hair!!UPDATE:  This worked great in the winter months but not doing all that good in the summer being as it has glycerin in this.

That is when I discovered that I have low porosity hair, and that the Deva curl gel is full of protein, which is not good for low porosity hair So, I went looking for something with minimal protein and found the Mop Top curly hair custard. I wasn't expecting much, because there are no curl holding chemicals in this gel, but I was very surprised to see that my hair was both fluffy and curly after just one little scoop (3 fingers) of gel. With Mop Top, less is more, so you don't need much. To refresh second day curls, just put a dash of gel and leave in conditioner in a small spray bottle with water. Spray and scrunch, and your curls will hold another day or two, even on fine hair. What I like the most is that this product never weighs down your hair. And it smells citrusy, which I like a lot."

Then I tried a MopTop sample kit and loved this shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has the perfect consistency - not too thick but not too watery. For a low-poo it sudses up amazingly, and is easy to scrub into my scalp. I can tell it doesn't cleanse my scalp as well as my clarifying shampoo, but that is to be expected. I will use it 3 out of 4 washes to encourage the natural oils in my hair. It has a great balance of protein vs. moisture. And best of all is the scent - I didn't know bamboo could smell so good! It is an addicting sweet/fresh scent that makes me really look forward to wash days. Which says a lot, as I am usually very sensitive to fragrances and there are many hair products I have to toss because the scents really bother me. I'm loving my journey with MopTop!"

I add this right after leave-in and just before I apply a hard cast gel; I can literally feel it sucking the water into the core of my strands, and it takes my hair from dripping to just saturated with one application.

I'm currently using the no-poo cleansing conditioner, the daily conditioner, the leave-in conditioner, and the Curly Hair Custard. The custard was my first purchase and came with some samples from the rest of the line.I will say it works much better with a little extra moisture underneath. After conditioning (or cleansing and conditioning if it's ""wash"" day) I apply a tiny bit of the leave-in while still in the shower with SOAKING wet hair. Then I step out and apply a liberal amount of the Curly Custard, being sure to flip upside-down and side-to-side. Then scrunch scrunch scrunch. I let it air dry then loosen the cast once it's completely dry. This can also be done with a diffuser, but I don't have time for blow dryers. I find I see a lot more frizz if I skip the leave-in."

Didn't provide any better results than lesser expensive products I can buy at my local retail outlet. I bought this because it is natural and minus the sulfates, which can dry out and damage hair and scalp.

I also changed shampoos at the same time, using a cleansing conditoner free of sulfates.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't really made a difference. Additonally, it tends to create a slightly crispy texture in my hair.  This will probably not be the experience for most people as I have very, very kinky, frizzy curly hair. Although each folicle is very fine, I have a lot of it, and WITH the extreme curl, it often feels almost coarse.I am Scotch Irish and just have crazier hair than most people here buying this product.

Research suggested that hair similar to mine benefits most from lightweight, moisturizing products. I ended up focusing more on using a lower number of moisturizing products instead of multiple lightweight products. I've used As I Am Leave In Conditioner for my dry hair since before I started this hair journey but decided to ditch it if I'm going to add on a curl activator/enhancer/gel. I tried Cantu Curl Activator, which did almost nothing to define my waves and made my hair more frizzy. I tried Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie which did help enhance my waves (not in the back though), provided decent moisture, reduced some frizz, but did not have much hold- next day waves were basically not a thing and frizz was back. Adding in Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel gave me almost no hold (Upon purchasing I didn't realize it was a light hold gel) and was very drying so I ditched that quickly and replaced it with Eco Style Gel (strong hold gel). It did help with definition and hold all around, not drying, but it wasn't optimal. I moved on to Aunt Jackie's Defining Curl Custard and no gel which impressed me with the moisture, decent hold, reduced frizz, and enhanced definition even in the 2A back of my hair- but it contains silicones that I knew would eventually weigh down my hair. Mop Top Curly Hair Custard Gel had been on my list of CGM approved products to try and I should've gone with it ages ago because this product goes beyond Aunt Jackie's. I have defined waves all around, equal hold, and it is moisturizing. I've gotten the best defined next day waves compared to all other products I've tried. With other/no products, my halo frizz is usually worse the second and third day- but even with humectants being predominant in this product, I have had no halo frizz. I usually get frizz in both dry and humid environments, I have not yet had a chance to test it on a sufficiently humid day. I am optimistic though."

I have a good amount of hair, so I use more than recommended, but nothing works better than this to hold my curl. I use the MopTop oil to scrunch our tge crunch and my curls still hold!

With the length and dying my hair and brushing out, I very rarely have wave anymore. Putting this in my hair and scrunching some before it dried gave me some wave. It’s a really light hold, no crunch and it doesn’t feel like I have any product build up. I’m hoping with some cowashing and adding another product on top of this one, it’ll look even better. Smells great!"

Finally a good hair curl product!!!,"When I was younger I had super straight hair.  Seriously!  Sometimes I had to perm it twice (it was the 80's when spiral perms were ""in"") just to get the curls to stick.  Over the years my hair has evolved and it has slowly developed major frizz.  However, recently I've discovered that when tamed, that frizz is actually waves/curls!  I've purchased some creams and mousses recently to make the most out of my curls, but all of the products I've tried have always resulted in tacky-to-the-touch, frizzy and crunchy stiff hair.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos and some of the ladies raved about this product and their curls did look lovely so I thought I'd by a jar and give it a try.  My jar arrived today and tonight I tried it.  It's AMAZING!!!  I towel dried my hair and applied this product to my damp hair.  This ""custard"" is runny but a little goes a long way so it didn't take much to cover my thin/fine hair.  I loved that it wasn't tacky and cause my hair to stick to my hand when I applied it.  I let my hair air-dry and I was happy to see that every time I checked on it, my curls were curling and there wasn't any frizz in sight!  When my hair was about  75% dry, I decided to defuse it and really give it the frizz test.  Once again... no frizz and my curls were even more prominent!  I've been disappointed by so many products over the years so I am so incredibly happy to find a hair product that surpassed my expectations!  I'm new to MopTop hair products but I'll definitely be giving other MopTop products a try in the future.I highly recommend this product."

I used this after using shampoo and conditioner and it was NOT thick enough nor did I feel like it penetrated the hair shaft. I tend to look the other way when I see a product that claims to work on ALL hair types including fine hair... I am a women of color and my hair is FAR from fine. Save your money if you have kinky coarse textured hair as this will not be enough for you. If you have fine hair and are type 3 and above will probably work great for you.

The frizzies are reduced to almost non existent .

It renews with water in the morning. Plus, my head never gets itchy and there’s no build up of product on my hair or scalp.

But the humidity is now at a point here in Georgia that I can’t wear it straight even with anti-humidity hairspray. Some aspects that I was dreading was my hair not drying for six hours and significant gel residue on the nape of my neck and on my chest that is even hard to get off with wet towel.  Thankfully Kinky Curly was out of stock. I washed my hair and applied Moptop and went outside in the hot sun and did yardwork. Sweating profusely. Most of my hair dried though! I pulled and stretched out the curls and still have good definition. Going out for a walk with temp still 86f. Will see how good of a hold I keep. That is always a challenge for me though. End of day my curls have lost a lot of definition. I have super fine non porous bi racial hair and have to scrunch my hair to get curls and use tangle teaser too, to help bring out my curls.

Plopped my hair up in terry turban, while completing other tasks worth about 5-7 minutes. Removed towel and clipped roots up.  Once dry enough, removed clips.  My hair looked so good all work day.  Left a light gel cast, similar to Devacurl gel, until I manually loosened them up.  Then the hair was soft and even more shiny.  This product is a must if you have over dry curls."

The barcode/info sticker looked like it had gotten wet at some point. However the contents of the container appear to be in good condition.Performance: nice texture to the gel, applies easily, smells good, dries relatively quickly. Decent amount of hold but more difficult to completely break the cast than Kinky Curly custard. Does have a lot of glycerin in it so it is not good in the summer humidity. My normally minimally frizzy 2b wavy hair looked poodle-esk after only a few minutes out air conditioning. I also had some white flaking as it apparently interacts with Miss Jessie’s  curl cream.Overall it’s an okay purchase if it’s not humid outside and I’m in a hurry to leave the house with dry hair.

I’m a loyal Deva Curl user for many years but my curly hair is getting looser the older I get, and a good product is needed more than ever to alleviate frizz and define curl. The smell is a mild citrus, very tolerable, and the texture appears water soluble and blended well into my damp hair. No residue and dried slightly crisp which I could somewhat shake out. However I prefer a stronger hold, especially as the day wears on in humidity. The key is to leave your hair alone when you apply product and that’s always a challenge. With Deva, I combine several different products to get good hold. This one does it all by itself. I’m very pleased so far."

This product is not heavy, is not crunchy, and provides some volume with zero frizz. It can be used on its own for curl and medium hold or under a gel as just a curl activator. New holy grail—I keep trying other things, and they don’t come close. I was not paid for this review."

A little bit of this goes a long way and you really don't need to use more than a nickel to quarter size amount depending on how much hair you have. Too much will actually cause you to end up with flakes so definitely start cautiously until you figure your perfect amount out.

Amazon needs to do better with the way they ship their items. Aside from that the product so far is good, it provides real good hold and smells good. The only con is that if you use too much you will see flakes all around your hair. It is best used on soaking wet hair so it will glide smoothly. I’m hoping it will work great during the summer months."

I ordered this when my sample ran out, and was excited that it arrived today.

It's my favorite gel for my 3a(ish) hair. I use it in combination with a curl cream, because my hair is thick and needs a lot of moisture, but this product can be a one-step curl routine for finer hair. I like it better than Deva Curl gel. It has better hold and does some special slip action that is very moisturizing and unique to the product. I also like the way it sculpts my curls a little bit more than the Deva gels. I love the definition I get from this product. Although you use a generous amount, I wouldn't load it on too thick, because it is fairly strong. You need to be kind of sparing when reapplying on second day hair--I would recommend not reapplying to the whole head. My only criticism is that it can create slightly more buildup than other lighter gels, like Deva. The smell is citrusy and lovely. The ingredients are VERY clean. Buy, buy, buy."

It has the perfect hold that doesn't completely freeze your hair, but still holds.

So just be sue to finger comb it through your hair very thoroughly before you scrunch it."

This does not so it doesn't work if used alone for me. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I need the cast for my hair to hold up for 2nd or 3rd day hair. If it's too soft on 1st day hair, it wont hold up. HOWEVER, this product is still GREAT! It adds great definition to your curls and it is very forgiving if you use too much. If you like soft touch hold with defined curls, then this is for you. I actually combine it with another gel. I first use it on really damp hair as a ""primer"" and then finish off with the devacurl arc angel ultra hold gel. I don't have to use nearly as much devacurl gel and the combination of both products give me great definition. I will be purchasing it again."

I add a leave in light conditioner before Moptop custard and my day of curls come out really nice.I also love that this custard is free of silecones and other products that just sit on top of your hair. ++"

The very first time I washed with this shampoo, I noticed that large sections of my scalp were covered in flaking skin. This was mostly an issue around my crown and forehead area. It was the strangest thing; the flaking would begin immediately after use (noticeable even under wet hair) and continue to get worse for the day or two after washing. After the hair dried, it would begin to itch and continue to get itchier as time passed. I'm not sure if it was just dry flaky skin or if it was actual dandruff, but the amount of whatever it was was astonishing (and gross).I stopped using the shampoo after about a week, and my problems stopped then, but I've used it a couple of times since (when I was desperate and out of other shampoos) and had the same problem. It's super weird but I haven't heard of anyone else having the same issue. Other than that, it smelled good and did a fine job washing my actual hair, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else experiences something similar."

I received a sample of this custard and I love it so far! It made my 2C/3A curls even more curly!  I use a denman brush when I wash my hair, then I scrunch this into wet hair on top of homemade flax seed gel.  I only used a nickel sized amount on my thin hair which is just past my shoulders.  My curls were popping like never before!  It does have glycerin but it's winter now so it works great 4 me.  Not sure how well it will work in the humid summer because of the glycerin.I see some reviewers complained about this gel making their hair crunchy but keep in mind you're supposed to scrunch the hardness out of your hair in order to get soft curls.  Other reviewers complained of flaking but this wasn't an issue for me as i used on wet hair and did not mess with my curls after they dried and I ""scrunched out the crunch"".  Maybe ""scrunching out the crunch"" with some light oil would help with that?  Anyway, I give this stuff 2 thumbs up!"

It feels like that sugar body scrub you use.  I put some on my damp hair.  It will hold some of the curl in, but when it dries it turns hard like glue then starts to flake.  Compared to Ampro gel, which is much cheaper, I like Ampro better.  Ampro will smooth out my hair and make it straighter as it is holding it down.  Plus when it dries, it is not hard as glue, comes out easy and does not damage hair.  Ampro does very little flaking as well.  Back to that,"

It glides through my curly hair nicely,"This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely, and helps keep the curl controlled as my hair dries.  Does not make my hair frizzy.  It smells nice, sweet like some kind of candy.  The reason for 2 stars is the bottle it comes in.  The product itself is pretty thick, like pudding.  It does not flow.  The plastic bottle it's in is thick hard plastic. It's ridiculously difficult to squeeze a thick, pudding-like product out of a narrow-necked stiff plastic bottle.  If you take the cap off you can ""shake"" it out, which is what I do, but it's not ideal considering that sometimes it shakes out a huge glob bigger than you need, which is a hassle again to scrape the excess back in.  The directions for use on the bottle state in bold letters, ""shake well"".  Lol, how do you shake this product well, especially when the bottle is brand new and filled to the top, and for what purpose?  Does the product separate as it sits it something.  No.  I just think there must be a lot of people in the company who don't understand the product or use it themselves.  The product would be better contained in a jar with a lid that you can dip your fingers into, or maybe a soft squeezable tube that can be stored upside down.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It doesn't seem like the manufacturer understands its own product. It's not exactly a bargain price either."

I like the gentle shampoo because it cleaned my hair without stripping all the natural oils.  The deep conditioner didn't give me the same kind of slip for detangling as the the daily conditioner, but it did what it said it would do.  The leave it in conditioner gave my hair a light hold like a gel without the crunchy hardness of a gel.  It also left my hair soft and smooth.  I will for sure buy the leave it in conditioner and the gentle shampoo again.  I gave this review a 4 not 5 stars because the deep conditioner doesn't have the same slip as the daily conditioner.  The daily conditioner is the best conditioner for slip I have every used.  If you have frizzy curly hair these products are awesome.  It costs more, but these products are very high in and they work.  I have kinky curly hair and I love these products.  BTW it your hair is protein sensitive don't use the deep conditioner more then once a week."

I applied a generous amount of this product to a section of my hair last nite and my curls were still a bit crunchy.

After washing I apply a small dab of leave-in conditioner, then use the custard, push into shape with my fingers and air dry.I have bits of hair on the side of my head that are a little stubborn with trying to curl the wrong direction and this holds them in place.

868,"﻿MopTop Curl Enhancer Gel, Reduces Frizz, Natural Ingredients, Kinky-Coily Curly Hair Gel, Made w/ ﻿Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey, (﻿Citrus Medley, 8oz)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best product ever,This product made a miracle in my hair. I have been dealing with alopecia and other autoimmune disease for years and I had a major hair loss over the past few years. I have tried so many products and seen no results.  I just received this product and started using right away.  I can't believe how shining  and how nicely shaped my waves are looking. I have no words for this product. This product is the best I ever seen. Highly recommend.

870,"﻿MopTop Curl Enhancer Gel, Reduces Frizz, Natural Ingredients, Kinky-Coily Curly Hair Gel, Made w/ ﻿Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey, (﻿Citrus Medley, 8oz)",Style: Curly Hair Custard,Verified Purchase,"I really love this product. I heard about on from CurlyPenny on YouTube and she swears by this stuff. I was hoping for a MIRACLE product that would really make all my curls extra defined and absolutely no frizz, but it's not working perfectly on my hair type. My hair is suuuuper thick, coarse, and I have a lot of it. It's curly/wavy but I know some little curls are hidden in there! The best method I found for me was to bring it with me in the shower, and after I rinse my conditioner out with cold water, I put a generous amount of this in my hair with my head upside down with a crunching motion. Try it! All in all I do love it and I may buy it again once I run out, unless I find something even better!"
871,"﻿MopTop Curl Enhancer Gel, Reduces Frizz, Natural Ingredients, Kinky-Coily Curly Hair Gel, Made w/ ﻿Aloe, Sea Botanicals & Honey, (﻿Citrus Medley, 8oz)",Style: Curly Hair Custard,Verified Purchase,You really only need a tiny bit!!!  A bit sticky but works amazing... gives a bit of crunch but hair is also soft.  Crunch wears off but curls stay... this will last a LONG time.  Smell is very citrus-y but wears off so not overpowering.  Would buy again!

It smells wonderful and gives you great first day hair. Not very good at hold for the 2nd or 3rd day hair! It however leaves my hair weightless and soft so I Use a little to refresh on those days.
