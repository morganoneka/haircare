My wife‚Äôs been needing a complete in-home hair treatment as she‚Äôs got long, curly hair that dries out easily, loses volume / depth, and is difficult to manage. With that in mind, she‚Äôs tried many shampoos, conditioners, and oils from various brands and this complete hair treatment proves not to disappoint! The TRESemme brand is well known and we‚Äôve often seen it on the shelves at the hair salon, big box, and grocery stores, etc.; however, she‚Äôs never given it a chance.First of all, you get 4 shampoos which are adequately sized for multiple uses and you get a lot for your money. The bottles are easily recognizable TRESemme branding with the details and descriptions, ingredients and ‚Äúdirections of use‚Äù clearly labeled.The shampoo is formulated with ingredients that help protect hair from getting out of control from humidity ‚Äì it‚Äôs made to secure moisture and create full curly definition. It has a consistency and viscosity that‚Äôs light and once applied foams up well over the applied areas - a small amount is sufficient enough to spread evenly.  There‚Äôs a sweet fragrance that‚Äôs subtle and not over bearing ‚Äì reading the description, it‚Äôs a combination of jasmine, gardenia, and vanilla. The specialized ingredients do a good job of removing the daily dirt and grime that builds up which includes hair product like gels, creams, and oils. Rinsing the shampoo is quick, easy, and leaves a clean finish.Overall, this is a great shampoo to get some lift back into dull, dry, and lack-lustered curly hair. A small amount goes along way and it works wonders to make your hair look, feel and smell wonderful. I‚Äôll be recommending this to everyone!If you found this review informative, then please click on the ‚Äú[Helpful]‚Äù button to let me know to continue providing these unbiased and in-depth reviews for this community.

No greasy look afterward.- Hydrates. ‚Äì From the first time I used this shampoo, I could tell a difference in the moisture level that my hair retained.- Smells nice to me and my daughters. ‚Äì Though it smells more like coconut than vanilla to me.- As this listing is for a pack of four, I will not need to reorder shampoo for a while.- Works well with any conditioner, but probably works best with the coordinating conditioner.Cons:- None.  üòäFinal Thoughts: I am a long-time fan of TreSemme shampoos and conditioners and the Pro Care Curls Shampoo did not disappoint. I am 100% pleased with the product.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product via the Amazon Vine program. All opinions in this review are my own."
7,"TRESemm√© Shampoo Shampoo for Curly Hair Pro Care Curls Curly Hair Shampoo Leaves Curls Defined, Hydrated, and Frizz-Free 20 oz 4 Count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The shampoo has a pleasant scent that isn't overpoweringly perfumed. It lathers up nicely, thoroughly cleans my hair, and rinses out easily. After drying my hair, I can't detect any scent from the shampoo. Despite the humidity, we've had little to no frizz, and the vanilla aroma is lovely but fades rapidly, so there's no need to worry about attracting unwelcome insect attention. We'll be able to use these four bottles for a long time. This product has a pleasant, mild aroma that is suitable for both men and women. It makes hair softer and easier to handle."

I've never found a hair product that actually changes anything about the curls; until now. The curls are well hydrated after a solid shampooing. When I say solid, I mean I have to use more shampoo than usual. It really moisturizes and I found my curls to be a bit bouncier after. There isn't much of a smell to it. Which isn't a problem because it's not crazy fragrant to where it smells horrible, but it also isn't crazy annoying either. Just a very subtle scent. It is $20 for the 4 bottles, making these $5 per bottle. That is a bit steep to me, but buying in bulk is cheaper than going to the store to buy one; not to mention more convenient."
9,"TRESemm√© Shampoo Shampoo for Curly Hair Pro Care Curls Curly Hair Shampoo Leaves Curls Defined, Hydrated, and Frizz-Free 20 oz 4 Count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"""TRESemm√© Shampoo Shampoo for Curly Hair Pro Care"" has a lovely vanilla fragrance that does not linger overly long after you dry your hair.  Although described for ""curly hair"", this shampoo cleanses straight hair well, rinses cleanly and leaves hair soft and manageable.  It may be very effective for curly hair, but since I have straight hair, I cannot determine its effectiveness for that hair type.  Nevertheless, this shampoo continues to strengthen Tresseme's reputation as a company that provides quality products at a reasonable price."

It lives up to the great Tresemme reputation for quality products as expected. My waves are bouncier and my daughter's curls are more hydrated and defined. We've experienced little to no frizz despite the humidity and the vanilla scent is wonderful but fades quickly so there's less worry about attracting any unwanted insect attention. And, with 4 big bottles, we're set for shampoo for a while.If you have curly or wavy hair you'll definitely want to try this shampoo, too."

It is sulfate free and doesn't strip your hair of its natural oils. The lather is decent, but not as great as a regular shampoo. On the plus side, it is very moisturizing and does seem to benefit my wife's curls. The vanilla scent is wonderful! Seems to help reduce frizz as well. If you're specifically looking for an affordable, sulfate-free shampoo, this is definitely worth trying."

I unfortunately do not have anything to compare it to but I am happy. It smells amazing and did well in their hair. I also have a slight wave in my own hair and I was surprised to see that it actually helped to bring out the waves in my hair. It thoroughly cleans and does a good job in my opinion.

His hair looks good enough when he uses this, but not with much noticeable difference from other shampoos.

20,"TRESemm√© Shampoo Shampoo for Curly Hair Pro Care Curls Curly Hair Shampoo Leaves Curls Defined, Hydrated, and Frizz-Free 20 oz 4 Count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far we like this shampoo. I won't use anything with sulfates. It doesn't seem to make my scalp itchy or my hair dry but sometimes that takes a half bottle of use before I noticed ill effects. I don't love strong scents in products. This isn't bad but is a little stronger than I'm used to.

It is the best for my my curls look nurised look beautiful, shine. Curly hair can not be washed everyday, I used it every 3 days, I have to do nothing expect let it air dry and my style is finished, curly hair is easty when you use the right products. I also used another brand of Mouse for curly hair from a famous maker in a greed nosel bottler. Tresemme does not sell mouse. Try this if you suffer frizz and want great hair every day."

I received 4 bottles of the shampoo and 4 bottles of the conditioner- all 473ml each.Shampoo-Clear and pretty standard thickness-I find that it lathers rather well-Rinses away without leaving an excessively squeaky clean stripped feeling-Pretty standard generic light perfume like smell... perhaps floral? I personally wish they would move fragrance down on the ingredient list and actually list the ingredients instead of simply saying ‚Äúfragrance (parfum).‚Äù-I do feel like it is effective in cleaning my hairConditioner-White and again it is a fairly standard thickness for conditioner, perhaps on the thinner side compared to some of my other conditioners-Effectively in conditioning my hair without weighing it down-Hair feels nice and soft afterwards-Makes my hair easy to brush in the shower as I usually do-Same decent but generic scent as the shampooMy hair is long, thick, and curly/wavy/frizzy. I‚Äôm happy with the results I get from using these products. Are they the absolute best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried? No. They are pretty standard, but they get the job done and are a good price. I have actually used various Tresemme products for a long time without issues. This is something that I would order again because it is affordable and works for me. I also don‚Äôt feel like I have to use too much of the products each time for them to work effectively.I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!"
6,"TRESemm√© Pro Pure Shampoo Sulfate-Free for Curly & Define Hair with 0% Sulfates, Parabens, Mineral Oils and Dyes, 16 Oz, Pack of 4",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"As a hairstylist, the salon I retired from recently has used TRESemm√© products for over 30 years. I've always loved their products and have appreciated them for being professional quality that anyone can afford.This was my second time trying their Pro Pure line. This one is specifically geared for curls, which I do have naturally curly hair. It cleans well, has a creamy lather, and smells nice. I like that it has Cocoyl Taurate in the first few ingredients, as it helps to moisturize your hair. My hair is very dry, and it also falls out quite easily, due to Hashimoto's. I did notice that it's not as moisturizing as their other shampoos. I did follow it up with one of their Pro Pure conditioners, but still felt like I needed a little more moisture, as my hair was still a bit dry. I added a little leave in conditioner, but I also didn't notice any difference in my curls.It seems if they're going to take out a lot of the bad things like sulfates, parabens, dyes, and mineral oil, which I don't see too often in shampoos, that they would also take out fragrances. Most people who try to avoid the things they have left out, try to avoid all fragrance, as well.I think that this shampoo would be great for those who want to stay away from sulfates, parabens and dyes, but don't mind fragrances. It would also be good for those whose hair is a little bit on the oily side and they need to wash their hair everyday. If you have dry hair, I would make sure to buy the conditioner that compliments this shampoo. I love TRESemm√© products and will continue to use them and always recommend them."

Helps by lowering the amount of frizz and flyaways that my hair has a tendency to have.TRESemme√© has created many different types of shampoos and conditioners over the years that I've tried. I've liked some, loved some and didn't prefer some. This pro pure shampoo works great for the health, look, feel, texture and more for my hair. I like the consistency and texture of the shampoo and the cleansing suds that it creates.Pairing this Pro Pure shampoo with the same style of conditioner and using them together on my hair has been so beneficial. I have used this entire bottle and since tried to find additional shampoo and conditioner bottles from this line. I finally lucked up and found it on Amazon and have since ordered a few more bottles to use.This is really a great shampoo that's fits most people's budget."

I don't feel like this is a good product for my hair type.  I have type 4A and 4B hair. I think this product would be better suited for those individuals with type 2 and 3 hair.

But sometimes those just don‚Äôt clean my hair completely so this shampoo will be great to use every few weeks to really remove all the product buildup from my hair. It doesn‚Äôt have a lot of the bad ingredients that dry out hair, but it does really lather up and I find that I have to use a deep conditioner after using it.

I could feel it drying out my hair as I was lathering. It foams and lathers nicely. The foam is very soft and expands as you lather. I just couldn‚Äôt help but get nervous as I felt my hair getting stiffer and coarser by the second. I think it‚Äôs probably due to the fact that this formula has many different types of sodium in it. I deep conditioned afterwards and my hair turned out fine. I‚Äôm just not comfortable with using this shampoo regularly. I have waist long thick wavy hair for reference. Overall, the shampoo has a nice scent, lather, and cleans well...just slightly drying on my hair."

The shampoo did not disappoint and is every bit as effective washing and leaving curly hair feeling natural.3 out of the 5 in my house have naturally curly hair, and during quarantine, 2 of those 3 have been growing their hair out. The shampoo (along with the conditioner) does a great job of leaving their hair bouncy and light, maintaining the natural curls.As one of the few people in the house without natural curls, I've been using the shampoo as well and have nothing but positive things to say. It's got a nice salon-like scent and feels good, leaving my fair feeling clean and light.It's also not a bad bargain as a four-pack."

I feel like it makes a decent shampoo although it's not a standout one for our kinky/curly/coily 4b hair. I like that there are no fillers like silicones, acrylates, or petrochemicals which are horrible for African American hair. The shampoo cleanses well (we shampoo twice) and there is decent lather from it. It smells generic but not unpleasantly so. This set is a good investment if you love the shampoo. I'd say try a single bottle first if you've never used it."

(Thanks to covid, I haven't had it cut or colored in more than six months.) It's pretty damaged and very prone to frizz.I've recently started doing the ""squish to condish"" method when I wash, which involves removing some, but not all, of the conditioner. (If you're not familiar with this, definitely Google it because it's magical for wavy and curly hair.) I have found that not every conditioner is well suited to this, though. Conditioners intended for curly hair tend to work the best. This Tresemme product is perfect to ""squish to condish"" with.My hair feels well moisturized but not at all greasy. It's shiny and looks healthy (or at least fakes healthy in a convincing way!). Frizz is far less than normal, which makes me especially happy.This conditioner smells AMAZING. Doesn't affect the performance at all, of course, but it's worth noting because it's just one more reason for me to love it.The other non-performance attribute of note here is the price. You get FOUR large bottles for a very, very reasonable price. And if you use Subscribe & Save, you can save even more. Products for curly hair can be so expensive, so I find it refreshing that this product is priced so reasonably.This conditioner may well be my new favorite. It really is that good. Highly recommend."

I left it on my hair as I continued with my shower routines.It washed out easily and did not leave a greasy feeling.When I towel dried my hair it seemed a little frizzy. My curls were not well defined and didn't feel so hydrated. I think I could have used more product. It was very thin, as I've said, and I did use more, but maybe I'll need to use even more.Guess that's why they sell you 4 bottles at a time.* I write reviews to let you know how this product was for me. and to aid you in making your decision, to buy or not buy."

I pretty much spend the entire summer with my hair in a ponytail because it turns into a frizzy mess. Thanks to  TRESemme Pro Care Curls, I can now choose whether I want to keep it down and natural or put it in a ponytail because it protects hair from the harsh temperatures. It  keeps my curls and waves nice and calm and eliminates frizz. That's not all. It also softens and hydrates my hair as well.  Its easy to work through hair. I use an amount a bit larger than the size of  a half dollar to cover my shoulder length, thick hair. It rinses just as easily. Hair is not weighed down or left looking/feeling oily or greasy.  Tangles are removed as well.  The scent of this conditioner is just gorgeous and not at all overpowering or gagging. Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long in my hair. How I wish it did.  Its a wonderful scent.I've been using TRESemme hair products for years and years now.  What an incredible brand it is.  TRESemme really knows how to take care of hair and this curl conditioner is no exception.  The price is more than reasonable. If your hair frizzes like mine does in heat/humidity, I very much recommend giving TRESemme Pro Care Curls conditioner a try!"
13,"TRESemm√© Conditioner Sulfate-Free for Curly Hair Pro Care Curls are Defined, Hydrated, and Frizz-Free 20 oz 4 Count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This conditioner by Tresemme seems to have some curl defining benefits and I appreciate that it is sulfate-free. Beyond that, it is not a particularly deep conditioner for curly hair that runs on the dry side. I have curly 3B/C hair, and few products actually work to address my hair needs, mostly dry frizziness. I did notice that this conditioner yielded some nice curl defining benefits without excessively weighing my hair down. It feels very light and soft. However, this conditioner doesn't penetrate hair deeply enough for any hydration benefits, and so my hair is not as de-frizzed as I would hope for. If your curls don't struggle with dryness, this conditioner is probably great. Other than that, this conditioner comes in huge bottles and so you get a lot for the money. There's also a moderate fragrance in there which smells ok, and dissipates upon leaving the shower. Overall a decent conditioner for curly hair that isn't particularly dry."

My kiddos and I tried out the TreSemme ProCare Curls Conditioner and it worked well for all three of us. The conditioner is simple to apply. I like to let it sit on my hair for several minutes before rinsing. It rinses out easily and thoroughly. It conditions the hair enough that it can be detangled, but the conditioner does not make my hair dark or greasy. I feel this conditioner does add hydration to my hair, but I still need to use my curl defining cream to get the level of definition that I like. Overall, my kids and I are very pleased with this product and I like that it comes in a convenient four-pack.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product via the Amazon Vine program.

I feel like the only difference between the two is the price for the other one is double the price of this one. They seem to be the same conditioner down to the smell and texture.I got this for my sister who has curly hair and she said it left her hair feeling smooth and helped keep her natural curls in place once it dried. I have straight hair and I tried to use this and i could tell it was not going to work for me because my hair type wasn‚Äôt the intended use.We got 4 bottles and these will last a really long time because you only use about a quarter size amount each time. Everyone goes through shampoo faster than conditioner so we will probably have to keep buying the matching shampoo until the conditioner is gone

I've always considered them excellent quality without the high price tag. I retired recently ago due to health reasons. An autoimmune disease has left me with extremely dry and fragile hair.I often switch out my shampoo and conditioner every week or so. For most people, changing every now and then is good, but when you've been a hairstylist, you accumulate a lot of hair products, so you change out a lot.This Tresemme conditioner leaves my straw-like hair feeling smoother when I rinse it out. I use the shampoo in this same brand and line also. After shampooing and conditioning with this line-or any of their lines, my hair feels nourished, conditioned, and well hydrated. When I blow dry it, my hair is much silkier, smoother and lighter. Because my hair is so fine, thin, and fragile, I don't need much conditioner, and definitely not heavy conditioner. I appreciate that this line is more natural and without all the unnecessary ingredients."

Totally acceptable to my less-distinguished tastes.It's thicker than usual conditioner, which meant I was oh so careful to squeeze out less of it to apply to my hair.  A small amount went far, easily covering my longish hair and making it simple to comb out any tangles.A slightly waxy residue seemed to remain, which helped smooth my hair post-shower.  I did add a typical anti-frizz product to it before styling, and the combination worked well to keep my tresses frizz free.  The scent is mild and doesn't linger in an offensive, strong manner as some do.Nice product, I'd use it again and will happily use this supply up."

I received 4 bottles of the shampoo and 4 bottles of the conditioner- all 473ml each.Shampoo-Clear and pretty standard thickness-I find that it lathers rather well-Rinses away without leaving an excessively squeaky clean stripped feeling-Pretty standard generic light perfume like smell... perhaps floral? I personally wish they would move fragrance down on the ingredient list and actually list the ingredients instead of simply saying ‚Äúfragrance (parfum).‚Äù-I do feel like it is effective in cleaning my hairConditioner-White and again it is a fairly standard thickness for conditioner, perhaps on the thinner side compared to some of my other conditioners-Effectively in conditioning my hair without weighing it down-Hair feels nice and soft afterwards-Makes my hair easy to brush in the shower as I usually do-Same decent but generic scent as the shampooMy hair is long, thick, and curly/wavy/frizzy. I‚Äôm happy with the results I get from using these products. Are they the absolute best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried? No. They are pretty standard, but they get the job done and are a good price. I have actually used various Tresemme products for a long time without issues. This is something that I would order again because it is affordable and works for me. I also don‚Äôt feel like I have to use too much of the products each time for them to work effectively.I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!"

I've always loved their products and have appreciated them for being professional quality that anyone can afford.This was my second time trying their Pro Pure line. This one is specifically geared for curls, which I do have naturally curly hair. I also used the shampoo that goes with this conditioner. My hair is very dry, and it also falls out quite easily, due to Hashimoto's. I like that it has coconut oil as one of the first few ingredients. It is very moisturizing and nourishing to your hair. The only problem is that I noticed it's not as moisturizing as their other conditioners. I needed to add a little leave in conditioner. I also didn't notice any difference in my curls.It also seems if they're going to take out a lot of the bad things like sulfates, parabens, dyes, and mineral oil, which I don't see too often in shampoos, that they would also take out fragrances. Most people who try to avoid the things they have left out, try to avoid all fragrance, as well.I think that this line of shampoo and conditioners would be great for those who want to stay away from sulfates, parabens and dyes, but don't mind fragrances. It would also be good for those whose hair is a little bit on the oily side and they need to wash their hair everyday. If you have dry hair, I would make sure to buy the conditioner that compliments this shampoo and also maybe another one to supplement it. I did not notice a difference in my curls, but you might. Though this is not my favorite line by TRESemme, I still love TRESemm√© products and will continue to use them and always recommend them."

The consistency is thick and creamy. It's easy to get all of your hair covered without feeling spots that you've missed when smoothing it through. I usually add oil to most conditioners, but I didn't really need it with this one. I also like the short ingredient list. The scent is light and pleasant. I highly recommend this product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier."

This conditioner was ordered so I could use it daily in the shower after shampooing my hair. If you're unfamiliar with curly hair, just know that using non compatible conditioner can be a nightmare that takes a few days and washes to fix. This conditioner is specifically made for curly hair, so I wasn't as worried about trying it and possibly ending up with my curls disappearing, or just really tangled hair.I tried this conditioner multiple times after also using a medium grade non moisturizing shampoo.The shampoo I used is mainly focused on hair cleaning but didn't dry my hair out fully. At first when I applied the conditioner, it didn't¬† feel as if it was very oily or mositurizing. To my surprise, after I rinsed the conditioner out, my hair ended up feeling decently moisturized and my curls looked good but not great. I cannot say that it's the best my hair has ever looked after using conditioner but it was still pretty decent. I also still had to use a leave in conditioner spray and cream after using this conditioner.As far as the fragrance on this conditioner, it's not overpowering but just has more of a natural smell to it. It definitely doesn't smell bad.As far as chemicals go, there are no parabens, silicones, or mineral oils in this conditioner. The bottle is a bit hard to get the conditioner out of and does require a squeeze but that's also because this conditioner is pretty thick. My favorite thing about the bottle is that it is clear and I can see exactly how much conditioner I have left in the bottle. On many occasions, I have had to hop out the shower and ended up making a very big mess on the floor with water because I had to try and find conditioner in the middle of my shower. This comes with 4 bottles total. The bottles are 16 oz each.I feel like this is a mid grade conditioner that does a good job, but not an excellent job on curly hair. I also like that it comes with 4 bottles, however I did notice that I was having to use about 1 and half times as much of those conditioner as I usually use when conditioning my hair with other products. This would be a conditioner that I would use when I need to switch up my routine, but would not be my daily use conditioner."

The TreSemme Pro Pure Curl Define Conditioner advertises as being free of silicones, parabens, dyes, and mineral oils. As expected, the conditioner has a light, pleasant scent. It offers some moisturization, but not as much as I expected, and not enough to give me defined curls without using a curl cream. Still, the conditioner definitely makes my hair easier to detangle post-shower. It does not leave a dark or greasy sheen on my hair. Overall, I am pleased with the conditioner.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product via the Amazon Vine program. All opinions in this review are my own."

This conditioner is thick. I mean it's so thick, I have to take the cap off to squeeze it out. Even then, it's like ketchup, it just won't come out. I decided next time I'm going to add water and shake it up just to thin it out a little. The conditioner itself has good slip and really clings to my hair when I'm in the shower. That's a good thing since my hair is non-porous and I have to leave the conditioner on for a while for it to soak up. Once I'm out of my shower and I run about a half a dime-size amount through my hair as a leave-in conditioner. I have thick, curly hair, so I can get away with it. It leaves my hair smooth and smelling great. Now, it's not a miracle. I can't say it works a lot better then my other conditioners, but I do think it combats frizz a bit more than some of my other conditioners. Also, the price is just right."

My hair tends to be wavy when long, and gently curly when short and layered as long as I let it dry naturally or without styling it.  This conditioner relaxes those curls/waves so that my hair becomes almost straight.  While that's great for styling, it's not good it I want to preserve the curly look.  If my hair were more tightly curled, I imagine that the relaxation would be something I'd like.I do like how this conditioner makes my hair manageable and silky, with good shine.  It doesn't contain silicones, parabens, mineral oil, or dyes, thus turning away from known irritants.  The scent is light, with a leaning toward coconut.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

She said she only used a dime size amount at a time and it coats her hair all the way through. It makes brushing her hair a lot easier and her hair feels soft after getting out of the shower.The downside is that this really does the same thing as any conditioner and hasn‚Äôt added any magic to her hair.

My hair has never looked like this before and its all because of this spray! It makes my hair really silky feeling, and helps protect against the heat. I love it!!

I do use the dryer if it feels damps after spritzing so maybe the heat of that activates it.  Leaves my hair smooth with no frizz and is not greasy.  I do not over do any product on my hair.

  ¬†- I have to say these products used together are making a big difference in my previously damaged hair. I had wondered if this spray would be too heavy or oily for my fine/dry hair.. However, it is light and smooths right into damp or dry hair. I highly recommend this Keratin Smooth line, all of the products I have tried are wonderful quality and so affordable too!"

I know this product is being discontinued so I'm going to be grateful with what I received. It works for curly hair."
25,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",2.0 out of 5 stars,Why does this make my hair flat?,"I have bought this at Target before and it worked great, but for some reason buying it from Amazon the formula seems different. my hair falls flat almost immediately after curling it."

30,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,üëç,Love this stuff. Tried it once and never stopped using it. I have fine hair and this not only protects it but seems to give it a nice subtle texture--just enough for a little extra volume--without losing softness and shine.
31,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product,"I've never used it before blow drying, I always blow dry then spray it on before straightening. It smells so good and makes my hair sleek and soft. My hair stays completely straight all day into the next morning. I can put it up in a pony tail to sleep, let it down the next morning, run a brush through it and its still perfectly straight enough to leave it down a second day."
32,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken bottle!,I love the product but most of it was gone due to broken cap. I want it replaced and there is no way to reach the seller!
33,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,I ave only used it once and since it was the first time i may have taken extra care on my hair and that is why it worked so well but i also just started the same kind shampoo and conditioner ... I am mainly writing this review because  I bought this product from Amazon mid February and it no longer has that weird spray cap and looks like a regular spray... so for those who had issues with that it is no longer the design at least with the batch Amazon has.

No smell, not sticky, and no crunch. I've wasted so much money trying other brands because this one is unavailabl in Australia and always come back to importing Tresemme . And it still works out cheaper than buying locally! Top service from this seller too!"

45,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome heat spray,This spray is awesome and leaves my hair feeling so smooth after blow drying. The spray I was using before this made my hair frizzy and kind of sticky/just not soft. I have none of those issues any more!
46,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"has some effect as a styling aid.  I have thick, coarse, and colored hair. This product makes it feel more ""in control"".  It has really cut down on the frizziness of my hair.  It seems to give my hair hairspray type control, but leaves it soft to the touch.  I order this now from subscribe and save because my daughter uses it as well, and I don't want to run out.  Amazon also doesn't charge for shipping through this program.  I highly recommend this product if you blow dry or use a staight iron like my daughter."

53,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing,it does what its supposed to do and it smells great as a bonus!
54,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",2.0 out of 5 stars,Product works fine but the bottle is HARD to use,"I've not used heat protection spray before, but I guess this works as well as any other. However, in 20+ years of using hair styling products, this is THE most difficult bottle to hold and spray I have EVER used. The first few days I was literally having to use two hands--one to hold the bottle and one to pull the trigger. I'm 5'2"" and have small to average hands. At it's widest, my hand span (pinky to thumb) is 7.5"". This bottle is too wide (side to side) for me to hold comfortably and it's too narrow (front to back) for me to hold comfortably. Also, the trigger is too high above the bottle and complicates the whole process. :(  I have finally figured out how to hold this bottle so that I can actually spray it with one hand, but it's difficult and I have to THINK about it. I really do not want to have to be THINKING about how to hold my hair product so that I can actually get it on my hair. And, the hand hold I finally figured out is totally different from every other product I use. Anyway. I suggest looking for a product with a more standard bottle design. I know I will be."
55,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",2.0 out of 5 stars,Heat Protection,This wasn't a bad product if you can deal with the weird scent but I personally feel that there's better products out there.
56,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,nikys,excelente producto
57,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have for curly hair,The only hair gel I use!
58,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good as La Bella,Smells great - but very small bottles and made my hair crinkly. Not as good as La Bella that I used forever.
59,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as expected but still nice!,"I wasn't needing a product meant more for spraying directly before applying a hot tool; this spray is meant to be applied to towel dried hair before drying. However, the spray disperses the product well and it has a very nice scent; I believe it did make my hair somewhat softer."
60,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",4.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely Product,"Disclaimer: This product is NOT a miracle worker. It is a great product, but if you have super damaged hair this probably wont do much. I use this product before blowdrying or using heat on my hair and i find that it leaves my hair soft and shiny. My hair type is wavy/straight, thick, and is bleached."
61,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product.,Love this product. Was Cheeper buying this bundle set then shopping at local store!
62,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,"For smooth straight hair, removes tangles",This product helps remove tangles and smooths your hair when you blow dry it.
63,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Do yourself a favor and try this!,"I love and reccomend this product. I saved a little by buying this online. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the product so naturally I wanted to save a little bit.I'm so glad I bought this from this seller and it really does save my hair from extra unwanted damage. If you already have super damaged hair you shouldn't except this product to magically fix your hair. If it is damaged, I would suggest cutting off the dead pieces with trims or actual full on haircuts and minimizing the heat you put on your hair for a couple of weeks if not months.I have slightly damaged hair from years of tugging at it and not properly educating myself on easy ways to take care of my hair. Like brushing it properly and washing it anywhere from every two to three days to help lock in moisture. I didn't expect a quick fix and even then it worked like magic for me.To enhance this product I used oils towards my ends after I properly distributed the heat pretectant. By doing this I can keep my hair straight for about 3 to 4 days. I have very latin hair, (a bit frizzy, not too curly, not too straight and a bit of everything in between) so my hair can naturally hold a curl a lot easier than most women and my curls can equally last about four days. After about two and a half days of having a curl, the curl falls a bit but it looks very natural and still very presentable."
64,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved the product it does wonders for your hair,Bought the product for a relative and they raved about it being the best hair product ever and you cant get it in stores so for the price. Its worth it
65,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice hair but made me breakout,"I liked how the product worked in my hair, however, it made my face break out along my hairline/chin"

69,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",2.0 out of 5 stars,Two Stars,ok
70,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",2.0 out of 5 stars,Nice smell but not really working for my hair type,"I realized after I received this that I keep trying Tresemme products and they always disappoint me;  maybe there is something about this brand that doesn't agree with my hair, which is thick.I've been heat styling a lot lately, and have never tried a heat protectant spray, so I was excited to receive this.  It smells nice.  The bottle actually says ""flat iron spray"", and I wanted something to spray on before curling.  My curls fell out really quickly, so maybe this is indeed more for straightening.  It smells nice, but I noticed no improvement in my hair as opposed to using nothing before curling.  In fact, my hair felt drier and less silky.It's also sort of weird that the front of the bottle says ""flat iron spray"" but the back instructs you to spray it into WET hair. idk about you but I don't flat iron my hair wet."
71,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,great for asian frizz!,"i have asian hair that has almost too much volume. I use this for when I blowdry my hair, but also every day use as my hair will ""puff"". it is light and no greasy and does the job!"
72,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair became brittle and dry,This product made my hair dry and frizzy to the point it was almost unmanageable. Also made it feel very brittle- I tried to straighten a section of my hair and it just got puffy and frizzy. Throwing it out.
73,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Gel,I‚Äôve been using this Gel for years & can‚Äôt always find on the store shelves. This is a great deal for a great product for curly hair.

75,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best,This is the only heat protectant I will use for my hair. It smells nice and leaves my very thick & long hair shiny and so pretty.
76,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Tresemme,"I've been using tresemme products for almost 10 years. I love the heat protectant. Personally I don't think it adds much shine but it works very well on wet hair, once dried hair is very manageable and less brittle feeling after flat ironing. Works best on wet hair. I would not use this on already straightened dry hair, only after washing before blow drying or other heat applications."
77,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy,Honestly... I‚Äôve used this gel for years now. It‚Äôs hard to find in stores besides Giant or Safeway do i ordered the pack through amazon but it is not the same gel. It smells different & does nothing to hair extremely disappointed and the bottles aren‚Äôt even full all the way.

The flat iron smoothing spray is light and leaves hair with a nice soft fragrance and very smooth just as the bottle says.  I still like the trigger dispenser better, but the product is still the same.

208,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly Awesome,"Never used a heat protectant spray before, didn't think they really made a difference. I'm a 20 year old female who curls/straighteners my hair at least 4-6 times a month and never considered buying one before I read great reviews about this one. It leaves my hair feeling amazingly soft, sometimes I spray it in to my hair when I'm just air drying it because I like it so much. Side note: I have curly hair that gets greasy at the top and dry towards the ends, so this will make my hair greasy if I spray too much towards the top, but works wonderfully for the rest of my hair."
209,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not much results,"The bottle I received did not have the handle spray pump, but just the small press down nozzles.

There was no way to tell that I did anything different to my hair. So really it is a nice smelling water."

I like that it left my hair smoother to handle. I then reapply to dry hair, brush it through after sectioning hair. This would be good to use with the flat iron. But I wanted to use it with the brush hair straightener. Although it straighten my hair when it came to the ends, I couldn't hold on to them to straighten. Had to use the flat iron to complete it."

241,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Entire line of the Tresemme Keratin marula oil products are outstanding and priced right,"This series of products with the marula oil is outstanding.  I have been using expensive Paul Mitchell marula oil products and loved them.  Now I love this and love the price.  There are a series of products - shampoo, etc., and they do a great job of keeping the hair smooth.  The best one of these products is Keratin Smooth Shine Serum which definitely makes the hair shine ---- but not in that fake super shine like some products.  I have to make note, though, of the shampoo ---- you don't get a lot of foaming actioin when you use this Keratin shampoo.  That doesn't mean that your hair isn't clean; it just doesn't foam up.  That takes a little bit of getting used to because we expect our shampoos to foam and that's because they have the the chemical sodium lauryl sulfate.  It's not bad but it's not necessary.  So, for me, the bottom line is that I like all these products."

I decided to try this product and do not regret it one bit. It left my hair feeling soft, smooth, and manageable. It did not feel crispy afterwards like it normally would so I was impressed. It also has a mild, and pleasant scent. The only thing I did not like was the trigger. It was pretty challenging trying to find the proper placement for my fingers to get a comfortable squeeze to disperse the product. I will have to empty the contents into another spray bottle before I use it again."

I've been doing this for a few years. I wash it once a week and use dry shampoo. My hair has always seemed healthy until recently. It's very humid in Louisiana and i needed something to protect my hair. This was the ONLY heat protectant at Walmart but i am SO glad i chose it! Seriously, in just one use i noticed a huge difference. It's a light spray but protects very well. My hair is now more bouncier and looks healthier after just three uses. I love it! Take it from me and get it!"

I didn't order via Amazon, but I obtained it  from Walmart.  I also use the Au Naturale Defining Creme first and then the  Tresemme Mousse Flawless Bouncy Curls and last the Tresemme Flawless Bouncy Curls gel. With all of these together they leave my hair moisturized and bouncy.  My curls are defined and they last all day long throughout my work day, even with my workouts daily in the gym.  I can still come back to work and my hair is still in place.  I am African American with silky, soft and curly hair and these products really work.  They all are stapled as my regular hair regimen.

275,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy grail for fine thin hair,"I have used dozens of leave in products and heat protectants over the years and they have all made my hair look greasy, dirty, and weighed down.  This product gives me all of the benefits of a leave in and heat protectant but my hair feels normal, soft, frizz free, and it's bouncy.  The spray bottle sprays a micromist that easily covers your hair in just a few sprays (I typically use 3-4 and cover my entire head and ends).  Detangling is a breeze and the heat protection is real.  I've been using this product a couple of weeks and have yet to see any new split ends pop up due to dryness.  I was honestly surprised that a cheap drugstore product could be this amazing.  I had previously tried Heat Tamer, by TRESemme, but it was too heavy for my hair.  If you have tried Heat Tamer and need something lighter, I highly suggest giving this a dry."
276,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,My Absolute Favorite,"As a curly-haired gal, I have tried my share of products. I have a few that I've liked over the years, but this curl gel is my absolute favorite.Before this, I had not tried gel because I am not a fan of how crusty it can make curls look. After going through a lot of products, I had been using TIGI Curls Rock and was pretty happy with it. I decided to pick this product up on an impulse because it was so inexpensive and I am always looking for new items to try for my curls. I am glad that I did!I used it as directed, putting a bunch of gel into my wet hair and then drying it with a diffuser. I found that when my hair is slightly damp, twisting it around my fingers with this product makes it form more of a ringlet curl, which is a fun change. When it is dry, there is no residue or crunchy feeling at all and it holds the curl all day. The only thing is that it doesn't work as well against frizz, but I found that using the Tresemme Tres Two extra hold hairspray fought off any frizz and made sure my curls were defined.I would definitely buy this product again."
277,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",1.0 out of 5 stars,False advertising,"This gel behaves the exact way the Tresseme level 4 gel behaves. By that I mean poorly. It has zero hold and weighs down my 3a curls, making them look like 2b waves. It got fluffy and poofy on the ends while wet and just overall looked like a gross mess. This also smells really bad like chemicals. It‚Äôs going in the trash."
278,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",4.0 out of 5 stars,My 2nd go to spray,"This is my 2nd go to hair straightening spray. My 1st & favorite is the Brazilian flat iron spray because it has a brown tint, but it has been off the shelves for some reason & overpriced online. So I've been using this red one for awhile now & thought I should write a review since I feel like a pro now. I spray this generously all over my hair after I shower & before I comb it out with a wide tooth comb. I will also use another spray like the kukui oil anti-frizz & mist it everywhere from top to bottom. I really don't like the way the tresemme split remedy leave-in conditioning spray feels on my hair, but since I have it, I will focus this product only on the ends of my hair & not the roots or top part. Then I blow dry my hair. When it's almost completely dry, I use a wide squarish paddle brush & gently work on my hair as I blow dry some layers on both sides of my head. This helps to add a little stretch & straighten out my hair. After it's all dry, I further straighten my hair with a flat iron (rusk heat freak) section by section. To do this I take some hair starting from the back & I spray the tresemme Keratin smooth onto the paddle brush & I brush out that section of hair that I isolated. I try not to spray too much, maybe 1 or 2 sprays, because I repeat this process with several sections of hair until I'm completely done ironing out all of my hair. I use a big clip to hold he hair that I haven't gotten to yet & I use a smaller one when towards the end when all I really have left to straighten is the front layers. After I'm done I use the wide comb to comb my hair a little & then I finish off by using Kenra silkening gloss polish & shine (4.4fl). I pump a little onto my hand because you don't need a lot, so although it is expensive, it lasts awhile & worth the investment, then I rub my hands together with it & apply it into my hair focusing in the back & under, not really the top part of my hair. It will distribute nicely just by workin your hands & fingers through your hair with it. This is my routine for straight shiny healthy looking hair. Unfortunately you will lose hair with over straightening & over washing, but I feel like I have no choice :/"
279,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this stuff,"I love this stuff!!! I only wash my hair twice a week because I color it. When I need to freshen up my hair I just spray it lightly and re-blowdry. It makes my hair silky and fresh looking.  Also, use it with flat iron and it again makes my hair silky and shiny. My hair is dry, a little course and somewhat thick. I use a more expensive brand and this is just as good. When I'm out of both I'm going to be buying only Tresemme."
280,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff!,I purchased this at a local retailer after reading the great reviews. This stuff is great.  I used it this morning and have been outside all morning in 100% humidity (florida) and my hair has not grown into the lions mane that would normally happen. The smell is strong but i can live with it if it continues to keep my hair tame.
281,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",4.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely curly hair - I love this product,"I have fine, color treated, extremely curly hair with frizz.  I bought this product to try with hot rollers, since my hair was still curly even after trying hot rollers.  While I haven't tried it with the hot rollers yet, I have used it after towel drying my hair and letting it air dry -- what a difference!  There was no frizz, the curls were softer -- it was really pretty, shiny and soft.  I then blew it dry, just to fluff it up -- I loved it.  Once I get to use my flat iron and/or hot rollers with this product I'll update the review, but it has done a wonderful job so far and it smells soooo good."
282,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"I bought this spray primarily because my hair easily tangles. I'll buy it again & again because works like a charm. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I have thinner hair but this product doesn't make my hair feel greesy or weighed down. When you spray it ,wait for about 15 seconds before you start combing/brushing. It gives it time to settle in,so to speak."

Revlon RV2513 Color Swirl Detangling Comb

  . If I don't use some kind of spray, even with shampoo, my hair is very hard to comb through, and it ends up with frizz when I dry it. This product does the trick very nicely; it does indeed leave my hair comb-able when wet, and soft and silky when dry. I haven't noticed any drying or buildup (and as I said, I use an anti-residue shampoo once a week anyway), but your results may vary. Also, my hair tends to be oily at the roots, and thankfully this doesn't seem to weigh it down or make it look greasy.PROS:-Does what it promises (protects from heat, helps smooth hair, keeps the little frizzes down, and a little spray is good for a quick touchup)-Inexpensive (note, I bought mine in my local supermarket)CONS:-They redesigned the spray part of the bottle in a way that is harder to use when you're spraying it on your own hair (it's more of a gun-type spray top now than a pump-type). The way you might hold it to spray the back of your head seems to cause stress to the attachment of the spray piece to the collar that attaches to the bottle, which causes the spray part to snap off, and I've not been able to get it to twist or snap back on with any luck, making the product unable to be used as a spray. I've kept an older bottle to refill when this happens, but it's frustrating! It's happened three times out of four already, and I'm not rough on it in any way. I'd recommend keeping an extra bottle with a different kind of top on hand to pour this product into in case this happens.NOTE: It's very slippery, so use caution when using it on a smooth/slippery/tile/tub surface!Overall, I really do love the product, and it does deliver as promised. I'm just disappointed that the bottle tends to break in a way that isn't easy (if possible at all) to fix. Still, I would recommend it."

It is pricey and I have had issues finding it in local stores. I decided to try this and was surprised what a great job it did. I have noticed that if I used it and blow dry my hair normally it doesn't make much of a difference. However, if I spray it on individual sections and use a roller brush to dry my hair it makes a dramatic difference. Creates a shiny, healthy, bouncy look. Will buy again."

It is almost the same as this one.  Working with that bottle cap gives you a hard time. I use it with Garnier blow dry perfector before I blow dry my hair.  My hair is dull, thin and frizzy. The humidity just makes my life miserable. This combination of products makes my hair silky and smooth and you need a shine spray to just give you that much needed shine."

I use this spray everytime i straighten my hair and it always gets the job done. I use this so my hair doesnt burn when i straighten it and i love the way it makes my hair feel. I tried other heat protecting products and none of them make my hair feel like this one. It works awsome and i really love the way my hair feels now.Plus, i also use it for blowdrying my hair and it works awsome too. I like my hair to be straight so i spray this then straighten my hair then spray a little more and rub it in, then blow dry. Its an awsome product and it gets the job done.I really love TRESemme because they care about their customers. They always make quality products for hair that i love using. This is my 5th bottle from them and it always works the best. Thanks alot TRESemme"

I either wash and go or I air dry before styling.  But since I wanted to check the length of my hair my styling called for the blow dryer and the dreaded flat iron.  I erred on the side of caution for my beloved locks and purchased this product along with the shampoo and serum for this Keratin smooth line of Tresemme.  I could run my fingers through my hair until I applied this product.  Immediately I could see the moisture leave my hair and my hair became sticky and rough as I blow dried. (BTW, I didn't use too much product, I separated my hair into four sections and sprayed each section three times, root/middle/ends, and combed through). Flat ironing did not smooth out my hair.  I had to start over by deep conditioning my hair for an hour and then using a homemade conditioning treatment of keratin, leave in conditioner, and argan oil.  Thankfully my hair is silky smooth with no signs of heat damage. I do not recommend this product and will not be using it again."

The problem I have with this product is that it's more like water instead of an oil; I was looking for something oily. This product makes my hair difficult to straighten."

I use it when my hair is damp, comb through and use my hair dryer.  It has a nice scent and makes my hair very soft and shiny.  Other products I have tried have left my hair feeling greasy but not this one.  If you want soft and shiny hair I recommend this product!"

300,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,My one and only,I've tried a bunch of thermal sprays/oils this is great. It's not greasy at all. I haven't gotten any split ends since I've used this. I flat iron my hair every two days so this is awesome!

302,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",3.0 out of 5 stars,Heat Protected Hair,"I have tested the Tresemme Platinum Strength Heat Protect Spray through the Vine Program.  This was an eight ounce bottle with a spray nozzle on top.  I wanted to try this as it said heat protected to protect my hair while playing golf in the heat of the summer.  I wear a visor while playing golf and thought this would help protect my hair.  It was suppose to shield the hair from damage of heat styling and add shine to your hair.  It said to use their shampoo and conditioner first but I did not have that product.  This was suppose to protect from all heat such as dryers, heat appliances, hot rollers and curling irons and designed to transform your hair with a smooth style that last for 48 hours.  This product is infused with keratine that leaves hair sleek and shiny.The directions said to spray liberally onto your damp hair then towel dry the hair and comb through.  I  found the nozzle was hard to use, it was hard to get the sprayer to work.  It also suggested to blow dry your hair while pointing the dryer downward to make the hair smooth.  This worked as I have straight hair and it is thick so drying the hair in this fashion made my hair smooth and straight.  I may have used too much of the spray solution as my hair looked dry by the end of the day.  I will be using this again when our summer weather gets here so see if it has the protection that it says it has.  Fairly easy to use once I managed to work the sprayer.Letta Meinen"
303,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,"This product rocks. At first I was hesitant to use it because I did not know if it was going to work on my african american hair. But I did!!! It makes my hair incredibly soft, bouncy, shiny, and somewhat mosturized, in my opinion. I love this product better than mine chi thermal protection spray. Another added bonus would have to be the design of the spray bottle, scent, and the non sticky feel of the spray. A must have for anyone who used flat irons, curl irons, curlers, etc."
304,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend!,This spray is awesome. It doesn't make my hair greasy or oily. It protects the hair as well. I spray it on my hair before I straitened them. Makes my hair soft looking perfect and protected.
305,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT USE!!!!!,"I have very curly hair, have had spiral, kinky curls since I was very little. Straightening was always an issue, it would take me hours. My sister got me the Kerittan 7 day treatment as a present in my Christmas stocking. After using this product for approx. a month, the entire top layer of my shoulder blade length hair broke to about 3 inches ( no more than the length of a pointer finger ). This product permenantly damaged my hair and will take many hair appointments to keep the damage done at bay and close to a year to gain back the length. I would not recommend this to anyone. The information on the bottle did not specify to over use and the company should take this product out of stores. I will never buy another treseme product again."
306,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THIS!!!,"Yes, it has a bad design, but it does what it says! Leaves my frizzy curls soft, bouncy, and protects against heat! And it smells AMAZING!"

309,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Product, Bad Bottle Design","PROS:  Lightweight mist with a pleasant scent.  Formula is nice that it keeps your hands clean by having it in a spray rather than a gel, cream, or mousse.  Keeps hair smooth and soft without feeling greasy or heavy.  My hair even looks great the next day without looking oily or flat.  Hoping I can get another day out of my blow out before having to wash it.  Good price.CONS:  Bottle's design is hard to use on yourself so much so that you have to contort your wrist in an awkward position to get the back of your head.  It would have been better if the bottle was a pump spray rather than a spray gun.  I'd give this product 4 stars, but the bottle's design made me give the product 3 stars."

319,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible overpowering smell, didn't do much to protect my hair","The title says it all. I can't believe some reviewers actually like the smell of this stuff?!? It's completely overpowering, and not pleasant in any way. It's a very chemically, awful scent, i can't even describe it. And the worst part is that it doesn't dissipate; it stays stinky until you wash it out. Finally, it wasn't even that great at protecting my hair from heat; my hair is pretty damaged and i don't even curl or flat-iron it very much (and never blow dry it; always air dry it). Plus, i see smoke rising from my hair whenever i use it (and i only leave the iron on it 5 seconds at most)."
320,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for airplane trips when you can't bring your favorite mousse!!,"Great for forming naturally curly curls...but it takes a lot of product to get the results I'm looking for!!  It would be better for someone looking for absolutely no sticky feeling to their hair products!!!  I need sticky stuff for my hair to keep my super-fine curls locked together or they turn into fuzz with the tiniest breeze.I do take this on airplane trips because the stuff I like most is a mousse which I can't take on a plane since I refuse to check luggage.  Instead I take this gel with me, use huge quantities of this gel, and my hair looks almost as good as when I'm at home."

322,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Product for My Fine Hair,I really like this because it is not oily or greasy as most heat protectant sprays are. I have fine hair so the oily products make my hair limp and feel greasy. This  product protects but does not any feel or look of havinga product on your hair. Highly Recommend it for fine hair
323,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Definite Must!,"I spray this in my hair every night while it's still damp.

324,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor product and design - do not recommend,"Did not work on my hair. Spray cap poorly designed and broke on first use. I thought I was receiving 6 bottles. I was wrong - one bottle for $23 is very expensive for a very poor product, and poor design. Very disappointed. Would never purchase again."
325,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",3.0 out of 5 stars,Probably works better for naturally straight hair.,"This is okay. It reminds me why I don't like spray heat protectants. Since it's a spray, it makes your hair frizz up again after it's already been straightened. It also doesn't protect against humidity like other heat protectants do. It seems pointless to use if you're just going to have to keep straightening and straightening. I'd pass if you don't have naturally straight hair."
326,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Product great, leaky bottle","Product is great, has worked well.  Packaging is lacking.  My bottle leaks at the top when you apply pressure to spray it out.  Not the end of the world--can put it in a different spray bottle, but annoying since it's easier to keep it in a labeled bottle that it came in."

332,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money!,Very water like consistency. Feels like you have nothing on and it doesn‚Äôt do the job. I mix it with a lightweight hair oil for a little better results. I really hate it.

I bought the heat protection along with the rest of the keratin smooth collection, so I assumed it would work. I have been using this spray for about 3 months now and I realize that my hair is SO much drier than it was such a short time ago. I haven't changed anything else in my hair routine during this time, and I don't even do my hair daily. I now have 2.5 sprays I don't know what to do with! The only reason why I gave 2 stars is because it smells nice, and I'm guessing it's better than using nothing at all and I like the other parts of the keratin line."

Straight Sexy Hair smooth & Protect Flat Iron Hairspray by Sexy Hair for Unisex - 4.1 Ounce Hair Spray

  , but the price per container is about half that of Sexy Hair if purchased separately, and about 2/3rds less when purchased in this 6 pack.My hair is left feeling smooth, soft and having no sticky residue, which I can't say for most of the other products I've tried over the past 5 years of flat ironing my thick, curly hair.I do wish it was more of a fine spray (less wet) and that it didn't take so much to get the kind of results I want, but some with fine hair may need less and only to do it with blow drying.  You'll have to play with it to figure out what works best for your hair.If you're looking for heat protection that also gives you a sleek, no flyaway look for less, give TRESemme European Instant Heat Tamer Styling Spray a try."

However, it smells really heavy, but not overbearing! It's very light weight. Also, I got this product 1 week earlier than expected."
442,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,TRESemm√© Keratin Smooth Heat Protectant Spray,"This product is amazing. I used to put on a silk serum on my damp hair before styling it, which left my hair silky. Then I found this spray; my husband actually uses Tresemme and this came with a shampoo/conditioner pack so he gave it to me, also a friend had mentioned something about it so I gave it a try. It leaves my hair silky smooth, glossy, healthy-looking every single time. My routine is I let my hair air dry, then part it in sections and spray it on a small section then style it with my John Frieda heated brush. It definitely protects against heat because I've noticed fewer split ends and my hair tolerates styling much better, whereas before it would become dull and frizzy.The best thing about this spray is that it doesn't leave a heavy residue in your hair. There's another spray by Tresemme that comes in a black bottle I got by accident thinking it was the same product and it was horrible, left my hair gummy, oily, and dull.I've had some doubts about the authenticity of some beauty products being sold on amazon based on customer reviews and pictures comparing the real product with a fake one, therefore I wouldn't trust getting this spray on here, but it's only about $5 at Target or Walmart anyway. So, if you use a lot of heat products on your hair, this is a must-have."

It's extremely itchy and takes forever to heal. There's a list online that lists products that use the DMDM hydantoin which causes this allergic reaction. Sad to see that affordable cosmetic products are resorting to unhealthy alternatives to keep costs down..."
444,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Ever!,I researched on line for a long time for a review on this by someone that is completely natural like I am to see if iit works. I came across one person who claimed to be natural because they haven't had a relaxer in 4 weeks. NOTE THATS NOT NATURAL BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE RELAXED HAIR!  Out of frustration I bought this product and it worked  My hair is straight. I also shampooed with the shampoo and conditioner in this line. I love it. I don't have any relaxer in my head at all. It was all cut out.
445,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best heat protectant,This is my favorite heat protectant of all time. Does not leave your hair feeling grimy and saves your hair from being damaged by heat. The price is great too compared to products like CHI. Highly recommended.

447,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Stretching Your Relaxer?!,"I bought this product for a friend whose damaged hair was on the right path to recovery.Just to give you some insight, her hair was porous with split ends and had a very rough, dry texture due to poor maintenance.Within four months, her hair was completely revitalized after weekly hot oil treatments, protective hairstyles like braiding, bi-weekly protein treatments and weekly deep conditioning sessions.She ended up straightening her hair with a relaxer. After a month she wanted to maintain her look and I bought this product for her.This product did an excellent job at maintaining her hair's sleek appearance despite two weeks worth of curly new growth.I researched keratin online and discovered its other benefits like:- Stops frizz- Repairs hair such as damaged or chemically treated hair (colored, permed, relaxed, highlighted or bleached)- Adds shine, softness and smoothness- Moisturizes and resolves hair damage- Dramatically decreases drying and styling time- Seals color"

I am not a huge fan of the other tresemme heat protectants but this one really works. The first day I used it I got complimented on how shiny my hair was. It makes my hair silky and smooth. I have fine hair so sometimes products can weigh my hair down, this doesn't do that at all. I have noticed less split ends, and my hair just looks healthy overall. I will definitley be repurchasing. It's also nice that this product is affordable. You don't have to spend $20+ on a good heat protectant."
450,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,TRESemme ooh la la,"I bought this at Walmart, not on Amazon but it's the same product. I read a review online that said it permanently uncurled a woman's hair but that seemed highly unlikely so I proceeded to buy it. Some reviews complained about the smell, I sprayed it before buying and thought it smelled quite nice. My only complaint is that is makes my hair feel a tad heavier but I haven't been using it exactly as directed. I think it says to spray while hair is damp but I shower at night and forget to spray it on before bed. This my correct the small issue I have with it. Otherwise, great product and I'll be purchasing again."
451,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this spray,"I love this spray! I have very fine blonde hair that gets damaged very quickly if I am not careful. For years I was using ""It's a 10 plus Keratin"" and it is $15+ for only 8oz. I switched to this to try it since it was a fraction of the price and I found that is worked just as well. Love it!"
452,"TRESemm√© Hair Gel, Flawless Curls, 8 Ounce, Pack of 6",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product,I love this product. Its a fragrant mist that doesnt leave your hair greasy like some heat protectants. I work in a restaurant n sometimes to freshen up the smell of my hair after work ill spray it a couple times.

First of all it didn't spray, so naturally I looked inside to see if it had one of those safety dripping caps.  It didn't so I gave it another spray and NADA.  I fiddled with the top and all of a sudden it dislodged from a little divice and while trying to put the 'thingy' back in the hole - three plastic small things fell onto the counter and I had no idea what the were or how to put them back into their proper place.  So there I was unable to use this Keratin Tresemme treatment.  LAST TIME I WILL PURCHASE THIS CHEAP PLASTICK SPRAYING APPARATUS.I also purchased the one in the Black bottle with pink top and it did the exact same thing - fell in pieces.  Now I have two (2) bottles of this crap.  Don't buy it."

  ¬†I strongly doubt the genuineness of the product. My sister ordered it and this is her review-The cap of the bottle was already loose. As shaken for use, the product spilled out. The bottle didn't come sealed, not even taped.. so it can easily be tampered. The solution of the hair spray looks like someone mixed water with a shampoo and it also smells like that.I don't expect any heat protection from it as of now, not even anti-frizz, coz the solution is completely watery, and there is no hint of marula oil that the description boasts of.If it worked even a bit, I'll surely update my review.EDIT: I recently got a haircut which requires regular styling and I have been straightening my hair at least twice a week for 4 weeks now, along with this product. And my hair stills feels decent. So it must be doing something, if not the level of heat protection it claims, but still something better than nothing at all. And also, better than other products I have used till now, including a Toni&Guy hair spray as well.Can definitely give it a try once, won't be a complete loss to your pocket or hair."

I've been using the shampoo and conditioner for several months. They seem to be providing my hair  with the moisture it needs and I haven't noticed any increase in hair loss.
