0,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very drying!!!!,I was quite disappointed with this product. I have used Shea Moisture for quite a while and always loved their products but this one I returned. The shampoo had a great lather but does leave your hair feeling stripped. Conditioner is very this and does not have good slip. Even after using a lot of conditioner this product left my hair very frizzy and dry which I do not have a big problem with. I purchased these for my niece and after trying them decided not to keep.
1,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Packaging needs to be better.,"This is a good product, but I would recommend purchasing in stores do to the packaging and how much product was wasted!!"
2,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Love this stuff it’s authentic and combs my hair out very well. I’m African American
3,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my hair crunchy,"I love the smell of the product and the bottles are a decent size. At first I thought I wasn’t rinsing my hair great because it was feeling crunchy after I let it air dry. I thought it was the conditioner, so I stopped using it and it kept happening. I made extra sure I had rinsed it all out, which then made my hair feel a little dry and tangled after and it still happened. Not sure what’s happening.. I’ve never had the issue before. My hair has also been feeling greasy quicker than usual. It’s not a bad product, but I was hoping it would be better."
4,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,This shampoo and conditioner will save your hair!,This is the best shampoo ever! I love the scent and it’s makes my hair so soft. The conditioner is light weight so it may seem like your hair isn’t silky in the shower but I promise when you get out and your hair dries it will be softer and shinier. Repaired my bleached damaged hair after one wash!!! I will buy over and over again!
5,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed,I bought this shampoo hoping it would give my hair some moisture and softness. But first it didnt smell that great and second it made my hair so dry and brittle it was breaking. It was hard as hell to brush my hair when using this. Even using a ton of  conditioner. I also noticed my hair falling out alot more. I will not be buying again.
6,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Amazing! Feels lightweight once dried!,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Also bought the Shea Moisture Hydrate & Repair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea butter  Leave in Treatment! Smells so yummy! I received many compliments on my curls! I’m so glad I bought these! I have 3B type curls! Showed a vid of results when wet and a picture of results when dried. (2nd day curls)  Once dried left my hair lovely and lightweight and fluffy not like Ramen noodle crispy curls!"
7,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent clean beauty shampoo,"Recently I’ve been trying to switch all of my products to clean beauty options. Shea moisture is one of the brands that offers clean ingredient shampoo at a reasonable price. This shampoo is decent, but my hair does not feel soft or healthier versus other shampoos I’ve used in the past. But for it being a clean product, and not many options in that price point.. it’ll do!The smell is hard to describe, not bad or good. Very neutral."
8,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,"I’ma fan of Shea Moisture. This isn’t my favorite as far as the scent goes, but the shampoo is thick and creamy and foams up deliciously. The conditioner leaves your hair feeling soft and is easy to comb thru. It stays soft for me even after it’s dry, whether I air dry it or blow dry it. Being someone with sensory issues, that really makes a difference to me (Pat)."
9,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,I loved these! I found the conditioner to not have that “slip” effect but I just put my hand with conditioner in water and then smoothed it in and it worked better. It’s been a couple days since I’ve washed my hair it still smells fresh and it’s so soft! I have curly hair which is hard to keep moisturized and it surprisingly doesn’t feel dry!! I will be ordering again!
10,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Shea moisture products,"I was really surprised at how these products worked for my hair not only did it smell awesome, but it made my hair so soft and moisturized. I really love the Shea moisture line anyways but I didn’t think I’d love other products of theirs. thanks YouTube influencer Rachael CPR for recommending this."
11,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair falling out,"Once I got about halfway through the bottles, my hair started falling out in excessive amounts. This shampoo also made my scalp very dry and flaky. But mostly I can’t believe how much hair I am losing. I’ve thrown these out and would never recommend"
12,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not made for black women,I saw the reviews almost none of them were black but I figured it’s Shea moisture. Even though they have a questionable reputation I decided to give it a shot. It did nothing for my hair. I have 4a/4b type hair
13,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,So soft and moisturizing!,I HIGHLYYY recommend this set of shampoo and conditioner.

14,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good but not practical,"I wish I could say it worked for me like a lot of other reviews. I have long thick color treated hair and it seems the shampoo just dried out my hair. The conditioner is also very drying and does not give that ""smooth"" texture I associate with conditioner"
15,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hydrating,"I am not happy about the scent but it does it’s job , my hair is definitely moisturized .

16,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Skin Irritation,Definitely made my scalp red and irritated. Would not recommend to anyone with any kind of sensitive skin!
17,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The most hydrating line I have come across.,"I love this line of products. My hair was breaking and I was looking for something that would help my hair. I found the leave in conditioner about a month ago and what a difference! My hair stopped breaking. So I decided the get the entire line just to find out it was discontinued. Thank God for amazon, they had it. My only regret is not going to amazon first. I know for next time. Thank you amazon."
18,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just okay.,Different formula now?  I dunno.  But it’s not the same.  The smell is off and my hair does not feel as soft as it used to when previously using Shea products.Will not purchase again.
19,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff,"This stuff is amazing!!

21,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very drying for scalp,"This product is very drying for me. After I use it, my scalp is so dry and irritated that it's flaky, itchy, and red! It's very moisturizing for my hair, but definitely not for my scalp. It smells great, but not worth it! If you suffer from dry scalp, AVOID!"
22,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing combo,I love the scent and the way my hair feels after each shower.

36,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken Pump on Conditioner Bottle,"Firstly, the shampoo and conditioner worked well for my frizzy hair.

96,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,leaves hair super nice after drying!,in love with this product
97,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,SheaMoisture products are always a hit!,"I have tried SheaMoisture products in the past but this is my first time trying the Hydrate & Repair shampoo and conditioner. The manuka honey and yogurt are really what sparked my curiosity.I just knew that this product was going to smell wonderful and it REALLY DOES!! The scent is soothing, clean, and somewhat sweet. The fragrance lingers on your hair long after rinsing and drying.The texture of the shampoo is just right. It is not overly thick which makes it super easy to spread through my long hair. The conditioner is thicker, more like a lotion, and coats my hair well. Both rinse out cleanly and easily. I am SUPER picky about conditioners because I cannot stand when they don't rinse out and leave my hair feeling slimy and slick. YUCK!These products are designed for extremely dry, brittle hair. I have combination hair (oily roots and dry ends) and they still worked well for me. I didn't apply the conditioner to the top of my head (I rarely do) but it worked beautifully on the rest of my hair, leaving it feeling silky, smooth, and manageable.The only thing that was so so for me was the conditioner pump. For someone with long hair, it takes awhile to pump out enough conditioner to cover everything. I think the opening may be a bit too narrow for the thickness of the conditioner. Other than that, I was SUPER pleased with these products!!!"
98,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Another winning combo from SheaMoisture. I've used various SheaMoisture products over the years and, WOW... does SM know how to do hair care! And that definitely includes the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea shampoo + conditioner duo.  The shampoo is nice and creamy. Not much is needed to cover my shoulder length hair. It lathers easily, doesn't weigh hair down and rinses without issue.  The conditioner feels nice while it sits on my hair. It rinses easily as well and de-tangles without weighing hair down or making it look or feel oily/greasy.  As my hair air-dried, my curls and waves were nice and smooth as well as soft and silky.  My dry hair was quenched and moisturized and both felt and looked good.  I don't have a huge problem with split-ends so I cannot comment as to how well it works on them but I know this duo strengthens and repairs my hair as I didn't have to scoop any out of the shower drain or my brush after using both.  Each  product has a lovely, light scent. How I wish it would be long lasting but its pretty much gone once my hair dries completely.  Definitely a duo I will continue to use and I hope it works as well for your hair as it does mine."
99,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My family has mixed results with these. We’re an interracial family (I’m black, mom is white, daughter is mixed) and we all have differen’t hair types and textures. For my daughter, she has very coiled and very coarse hair and her hair is mostly co-washed but we won’t continue using them for her because even the conditioner feels a bit drying after using. My wife has curly, coarse hair (but not the same texture, or as much curl as our daughter) and has pretty decent results with these. She likes the conditioner best but is not her favorite but it’s not bad, in her opinion.I keep my hair short, so I guess that's why it works best for me lol but it does seem to keep it moisturized and look healthier.We all agree that the scent is nice. The product has a shimmer, pearlized look.The shampoo bottle has a push-open top and the conditioner has a pump. The pump is kind of skinny- which can be difficult to push down when your hands are wet and soapy."
100,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13ozThis is a great set of shampoo and conditioner. It smells lovely - like milk and honey, soothing and relaxing - and delivers a solid clean and condition.The shampoo has a press-down dispenser top that lets you pour out the amount of shampoo you need. It came out thinner than I expected, but delivered an excellent lather and really left my hair feeling clean and moisturized.The conditioner has a pump dispenser, which works beautifully for the thicker product. It pumps out in a thick ribbon of conditioner and really delivers on the stated benefit of hydration and repair. I have a LOT of thick wavy hair and this detangled and left my hair soft and silky after only about a minute of leaving it in.I think it is brilliant that they used different delivery mechanisms for the two products. It recognizes the different thickness of each and means that you get the right amount of product for the purpose with minimal effort. This is great stuff!"
101,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The shampoo is a thinner, more liquid texture than I expected, but when massaged into my hair it makes thick, luxurious bubbles, you can feel how gentle and moisturizing it is. It feels expensive! The conditioner is thicker texture, but the pump on the bottle doesn't spit out nearly enough; it took me a good 6-8 pumps to get enough to cover my shoulder-length hair. It didn't feel particularly special on my hair, and rinsed out very cleanly, leaving no extra weight on my hair whatsoever. But the result after air-drying made me super excited!! The combination of reparative moisture and lightweight cleanliness made my dried-out overprocessed hair bounce back with soft luxurious waves and curls! My hair only curls up under the absolute best of conditions, and this produced the best natural curls & waves I have ever seen on my own head."
102,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This moisturizing, sulfate-free shampoo by SheaMoisture is a shampoo for damaged hair that works alone to gently cleanse hair and strengthen strands from root to tip when used with the conditioner. Apply this moisturizing shampoo for damaged hair to wet hair and gently massage into a rich lather. Rinse thoroughly. For best results, follow with SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Conditioner, it is a rinse-out conditioner that softens, detangles and infuses damaged hair with intensive moisture for hair repair."
103,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was so amazed at how luscious this shampoo is. I honestly didn't expect it to work as well as it did but it did. I used it on 3 different textures of hair and it made them all feel soft and detangled during the process. I was truly happy with how soft the hair was after washing. It has a really light smell that's not really long lasting in the hair after the fact. I didn't really care for the conditioner though because it was not as luscious and detangling as the shampoo. I found myself using something else in place of that. But the smell on both was amazing. I love it. I just wish the shampoo came in a larger size because of how much we wash hair around here.
104,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is yet another line from this brand that works well for my kinky/curly/coily type 4b hair. The ingredient lists are full of goodness with no fillers, silicones, acrylates, etc.The shampoo cleanses without stripping and doesn't leave my hair dry when I don't have time for leave-in conditioner. The conditioner has a lotion-y consistency but helps with detangling and leaves my hair soft.I didn't care for the scent at first, and actually still don't, but it's growing on me because the lingering after-wash scent is much more agreeable. Would recommend unless you're very sensitive to fragrance."
105,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible for my fine, thin curly hair","I have used other Shea Moisture conditioners in the past with better results (the best one is Smooth & Tame Conditioner for Frizzy Hair with Argan Oil & Almond Milk, but that seems to go in and out of stock frequently so I wanted an alternative). First, this is actually very thin and I required more product than with other conditioners. My hair also felt like straw after rinsing, and while the curls are more defined, they're also very frizzy, which sort of defeats the whole point of the conditioner! Maybe this works better for people with other hair textures, but it is definitely not good for mine. It also has a rather cloying scent."
106,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Here are some key points in my experience with this product:- Good packaging and love the shimmery look of shampoo- worked well on my hair type (very long, curly/frizzy, and dry)- Smells amazing but not very strong scent- Left my hair feeling very soft, light and fresh scented- has detangling effect on hair- only thing that I could consider a con about this product is that its not vegan (contains honey & yogurt) but otherwise ""cruelty free""overall great experience with this product, I would consider getting this product again."
107,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent,I would say this is in the middle of the road. I have dry and damaged hair and find it hard to find products that work well on my hair. I would say this is equivelant to Tresemme. Not as good as redken but much better than say garnier. It smells nice and say if you are not wanting something really expensive but does a decent job then this would be the stuff.
108,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Heavily fragrance which I do like for hair care products. I like being able to smell my hair after it's dried. The formula is thick and rich and feels very luxurious. Sulfate free which I love as well.  Especially good for curly or wavy hair.  My hair is bouncy, manageable and smells terrific.  My hair feels healthy and moisturized.  The bottles are not very big and wide circumference which makes them not as easy to handle, especially in the shower. Overall a great product but a bit high priced for the size."
109,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,nice set but a curls didn't hold up,"I like the results I got with this set on my 3a/3b curls.  I just wish that it had lasted past day one.  I used my usual styling products and styling techniques after using this shampoo and conditioner.  Day one was great.  For some reason, my day 2 curls were all over the place and I could not revive them without a co-wash. I have not figured out what my hair did not like that caused it crazy hair I got.  I had much better luck with the Power Greens set by the same company.  I will go back to that one."

My youngest has tight curls and my oldest has loose curls. Both of their hair will get dried out by some of the curl gel or cream I use on them. This shampoo and conditioner restore moisture and made their hair softer. The scent is tolerable, it has slightly sweet scent."
111,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost as soon as I opened ""SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Shampoo & Conditioner"", the fragrance overpowered everything.  I used this duo once and developed a headache that required me to rewash my hair with another brand of shampoo.  While you may find this product excellent, I am unable to use it because of its stronger fragrance.  I wish manufacturers would take fragrance-sensitivity into account before using strong perfumes in their products."

   My husband purchases this for me and I really wanted to love this product especially because i loved their deep conditioner, unfortunately the conditioner sucks on this. No matter how much i put on my hair it doesnt condition it. I basically pulled half my hair out trying to untangle. I wouldn’t recommend. Unfortunate because I love the smell and purchased basically the entire line."

This smells amazing! I love when I take my hair down at night and can still smell the conditioner. I’ve even used it as an overnight leave in and when I rinsed the next day my hair looked so shiny and healthy. I love this particular brand of hair are products so I was happy to be able to try it out for free. I really recommend this one.
114,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair shampoo and conditioner are fantastic products.  The shampoo felt wonderful and has a delightful scent as does the conditioner.  My hair is fine and sometimes tends to be dry, and this shampoo left my hair soft and manageable.  These are great products if you blow dry your hair and use a curling iron repeatedly as they can dry out your hair."
115,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Contains salt, which is dehydrating","The shampoo really damaged my Brazilian blowout. While it does not seem to contain sulfates, sodium chloride (salt) is listed in ingredients label. Both sulfates and salt will dissolve/remove keratin. The ingredients lists provided online need to be consistent with label on bottle. Beware if you have had a keratin treatment.I read this ingredient is used as a thickening agent and thus seems unnecessary. Salt absorbs water, and thus is drying/demoisturising to hair. A product adverised for dry, damaged hair should leave out hyperosmotic agents like salt. Product needs improvement."
116,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very hydrating,"I haven't tried anything like this before, so I was happy I could try this out. The scent of this is pretty refreshing. I have been putting this in my hair about 2 times a week and I feel like my hair has slightly gotten better when it comes to tangles as well as frizz."
117,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Like the shampoo but not the conditioner,"I like the shampoo in this set more than the conditioner. I have long, naturally curly hair that is medium thickness and the shampoo works well with it but the conditioner doesn't do much for it. It takes a lot of the conditioner to even feel like it's working and even then it doesn't hydrate much at all."
118,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the product itself.  The shampoo and conditioner both smell great.  My hair feels great after, soft and smooth.  My only issue is I'm not too keen on the pump for the conditioner, either a wider nozzle or a cap like the shampoo would be much better, or even switched around."

124,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay,"I thought I was going to really like this one because I loved the raw Shea butter and figure since it was to reallly help with damage repair, it would be great . Unfortunately it was disappointing at the start when I opened the package and the product was leaking from the bottle. Not too much but definitely a sticky mess. Cleaned it and just figured to give it a shot. I did like the shampoo, it was great on my hair . Sadly the conditioner had my hair very dry. Even before getting rinsing, as I applied it , it did not feel hydrating at all :/ I will definitely go back to the raw Shea butter"

131,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair conditioner For Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner 13oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn’t work, didn’t like it.","I am indian, i have a thick head of medium ish thin/course hair that is wavy, probably 2B waves. I believe my hair is low porosity because I tried tests and that’s what it came out with. This shampoo and conditioner was awful on my hair. At the roots and top of my head, it made my hair feel sticky and rough. It was hard to run my hand through or get a comb through. At the ends, it completely flattened all the waves/curls I had and it became really frizzy. Pretty sure this product just sat right on top of my hair instead of getting absorbed. Works for others maybe, but definitely not if you have hair like mine. Made a lot of my hair fall out too. I suggest getting Hask shampoo, it’s cheaper and it works better on my hair."

However, I’m giving the product an overall rating of 1 star as the conditioner bottle had a broken pump (despite that it came in a sealed package…implying that it was knowingly handled broken at the warehouse)."

0,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Feel like it was tampered with and watered down,"Really disappointed in this. I have gotten it before from a store and loved it.  I ordered this on Amazon and am convinced the package was tampered with.  The seal on top was cheap and popped off easily.  It looked like one you would find on one of those “cruise booze” shampoo bottle seals that wasn’t really sealed down and just pressed on top. The shampoo itself was VERY watery and thin, with a light scent. This Shea moisture product (the one I previously bought in a store) was a very thick shampoo with a great (and strong smelling) scent. There is no way this wasn’t tampered with.  I threw it out immediately. I wish I would have taken a picture but I didn’t.  Be careful when purchasing beauty/hair products online apparently."

My hair never really gets knotty. Like ever. I would only need to finger brush it at most. But after using this product my hair was SO dry and SO frizzy! My curls were so sad. I couldn’t even run my fingers in hair past my ears because it was just knots every where. I would also have to use up to 10 pumps of this conditioner to coat my mid shoulder length 2C hair. This was NOT what I expected after using the same line of Shea products leave in deep conditioning treatment

My crown is the driest and as a result very brittle.  I have been searching for a shampoo that would add moisture.  This shampoo did just that.  I took a chance because I have tried other lines from Shea Moisture with terrible results but this shampoo was made for my hair, its texture and its thirst for moisture.  Now I have the leave in and the conditioner.  Thank Goodness I found something that works for my hair."

So when I saw it on Amazon I was thrilled. Buyers beware... When I received this and used it the smell was absolutely off from the product I buy at the store. It was a foul smell almost as if it was expired?
7,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,100% RECOMMEND!,"I’m a stickler for quality in a product. If something doesn’t perform well, it gets canned. For a while, I’ve been trying to find a natural, cruelty/sulfate/paraben/artificial fragrance-free shampoo that is high-quality and decently affordable. I bought this on a whim, and after two months of use, it has proven itself to be a great purchase and it’s my new go-to for shampoo. Using this shampoo, a little truly goes a long way - I can rely on a thorough clean with LESS THAN a dime size of product. This formula replenishes & maintains moisture without making your hair too greasy/weighing hair down."

When I realized I was almost out, I decided to order more so I could get it fast, and ignored the reviews about this being a counterfeit product. Bad idea! This bottle came unsealed with conditioner leaking out AND it’s brown! Every other bottle I’ve had was pure white. It looks like it’s been tampered with and I am not about to lather this on my head."

Partially due to this!,A few months in using this on my long curly hair! It is an absolutely is a game changer. I started loosely following the curly girl method and my hair has grown so much and all of the hair I lost from psoriasis being on my scalp for so long is coming back due to using better products. My hair is constantly getting better and I’m so close to my goal of bum length hair! I think it’ll be maybe a year or two more before it gets there. My baby hairs are all getting to ear lobe length tho so they are also growing fast! Thank goodness for people who actually know stuff about hair on the internet!
12,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,New fav shampoo,My hair is 4B/high porosity for the naturalistas who like to know. I have been using this shampoo for a few months and love it. I normally like a squeaky clean feel after a shampoo but found my hair was getting too dry. This shampoo is a great middle ground and leaves my hair/scalp feeling clean but not stripped. My hair also feels soft and fluffy after rinsing. It smells amazing! I also use the deep conditioner and both leave my hair smelling so good. Overall would recommend for all natural hair types.
13,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shea moisture is awesome,I've used this shampoo for a while. It works really well and the scent is nice but not to strong which is good. It's not overly thick and not liquidity either.  This in combination with the conditioner and hair mask saved my damaged hair.

16,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for dry scalp,"This shampoo is truly good for dry scalp. Your hair will shine after using it. The small flakes largely go away. I imagine this product is also good for people with thinner hair who value strengthening. My hair sheds significantly less using this shampoo than most others as well. I like the smell. I appreciate that it's affordable and made using clean ingredients. As a guy with thick hair, I think it's harder to style my hair after using this product. For most people with dry scalp (and no dandruff), this is should be a good buy."

I'm not requesting a refund or a new bottle as it wasn't the whole bottle or even half of it.  Just beware.  I've not tried it yet, as I just got to my mom's and not tried this shampoo before.  I'll have to update after a few washes for that info."
18,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite shampoo,"They seemed to take the reviews seriously, and my shampoo came with a seal and wrapped in plastic to keep the cap on firmly. I adore this shampoo. The scent to me is definitely similar to perfume, but I enjoy it and think it is a very warm scent. I’ve tried many other shampoos, even from the same company, and nothing seems to leave my hair as soft and manageable as this one. I keep coming BACK to this shampoo. I can definitely manage to limit my washes without my hair getting greasy from any left behind residue. It is thinner, but I like that it is. As someone who has A LOT of hair, I find that this product lathers nicely and is easily spread, so I find myself using less shampoo than I typically would. I have natural thick and wavy hair (natural beach waves and some loose spiral curls), that can never decide what it wants to do. I definitely notice that with this shampoo my waves are more defined and don’t tangle as easy."
19,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Same great scalp care with great new scent,"I’ve been using the tan version of this conditioner, the matching shampoo, and Nizoral to keep my dermatitis in check with great success. I decided to try this new version because I have the option to subscribe with Amazon and the results are the same, if not better. Also, this version is scented like flowers, which I actually like because the older version, while it smelled nice (like soft shea butter), did not hide the smell of the Nizoral very well for me."
20,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,I will forever use one of their hair products. My hair was dry and breaking. After a month of using their shampoo and conditioner sets I began to see the difference of no breakage and my hair stayed more moisturized. And the scents are great. I love it! I use it on my children as well.

But I am not happy with how the product arrived. Trash in the bubble envelope. The bottle was obviously dropped on the lid- the seal was broken- which makes me not want to use it, the lid was lopsided when put back on; probably because the thread on the lid was busted."
27,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smoothing!,"This has really helped to smooth and relax my frizzy hair. This conditioner has been a life saver since I started using it. My hair has a mixture of different curl types but nothing too curly and might be considered more wavy. However, I have a very frizzy top layer of hair. This conditioner has solved all my frizzy and dry problems. When I blow dry I can get away without straightening it if I want and I can actually let my hair air dry and have a similar texture throughout now!"

136,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Ruined my favorite brand,"The last three scents - sativa, castor oil, manuka honey and yogurt - I have bought from three different stores (two pharmacy chains and one big box chain) have ALL been WATERY and horrible.  This has been my favorite brand for 8 years, but at the price, I can't keep wasting money on watered down product.  I don't know what happened to the rich, luxurious shampoo that my family loved.  Pour this in your hand and watch your money seep through your fingers and down the drain."
137,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good. Was told that hair looked dry and mangled after usage!,"I’m sure a lot of people get good results from this, but my experience is far from it. I used the shampoo conditioner before going to work one day and wore it in a pony tail. I was trying so hard to like my results just to feel like I didn’t waste my money, and I asked a coworker of what she thought of my hair and she said it didn’t look as good as it always does. It stripped me of my moisture and did the exact opposite. It made it sticky and little to no volume. I have 2a/2b medium curly hair that’s been highlighted. I don’t reccomend if your hair is similar to mine."
138,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works well for my hair,"Highlights has made my hair thinner and brittle. I got this small pack and used it 3 times. My hair has gotten better than it was. It's somewhat hydrated, less dry and smells great. The smell is not too strong, and the ingredients in this is really good. I'll keep using this treatment more times."
139,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for hydration. Highly recommend for natural hair!,"Love all Shea Moisture products. This one works well, great consistency, so easy to apply and wash out. Leaves hair hydrated and soothed. I use it along with the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter shampoo and the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter hair mask as well. All work very well for my natural hair."
140,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Great Great!,Love it. I use the whole line (the conditioner and the hair mask). They leave my hair feeling soft and hydrated. Also prepare it nicely for styling. Can't be happier.
141,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Shipping,"I needed this order shipped to me this week because I am in desperate need for conditioner. It said it would arrive by the 25th, and everyday it says it is going to come later. Now it's supposed to arrive by October 6...thats in a week. The entire reason why I ordered this conditioner was because it was going to arrive here soon."
142,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good!,I got this from another store but i agree with low ratings that its not for 2a/b type of hair. It leaves some kind of coating on your hair and weighs them down.
143,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Nope!!!,"Ewww this stuff sucks! The smell is really strong and does nothing for the hair ( Thick , course , semi wavy ) it’s not creamy, it’s not softening and worse it dried my hair and leaves residue!!!!"
144,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smell is Vile and Makes Hair Dry and Unmanageable,"I bought this conditioner when the store recommended for dry and damaged hair.  First, the smell was annoying and perfumey.  I had to rewash my hair to get away from it.  It left my hair feeling dirty, encrusted and even dryer than before.  This stuff was a disaster.  Total waste of money."
145,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dried my hair!!!!,Super drying!!!!

It has helped to repair my hair and gives me great slip when washing. I pair this with the conditioner and my 3c/4a hair responds well and my curls look great afterwards.
147,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great shampoo but not the Conditioner,This shampoo is far superior than it's matching conditioner. Hair doesn't feel super tangled after shampooing.

150,"SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Moisture Shampoo for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey Moisturizing with Shea Butter, Honey & Yogurt, 13 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not as clean and healthy as they seem—ingredients include “fragrance” & they REEK OF PERFUME!!,"If you’re looking for a healthy, clean, natural shampoo and conditioner without added chemical junk—THIS IS NOT THE BRAND FOR YOU. I decided to try these SheaMoisture products which were recommended by a friend after my own shampoo and conditioner became impossible to find. I thought they looked lavishly moisturizing and were a very clean/healthy option based on the marketing. I somehow missed that the list of unhealthy additives they don’t use did not include “fragrance.” Holy moly...I read another review on here that described the perfume smell of these products as an old Avon perfume their grandmother used to wear. I probably would’ve ignored that review before actually smelling these products but WOW did she hit the nail on the head. My shampoo came damaged and leaking in the package and the little bit that coated the container has made my entire bathroom and hallway smell to high heaven of hardcore perfume ever since it arrived. And it’s never actually been opened. My hand, just from touching the leaked bottle, smelled strongly of the stuff for an entire day despite multiple washings with strong soap. I cannot even imagine walking around with a head full of hair smelling like this stuff. It’s an instant headache trigger for me which is a strong indicator of chemicals. I checked the ingredients and sure enough, there was the culprit—“fragrance (essential oil blend).”DID YOU KNOW: If the ingredient listing says fragrance or parfum, this means the shampoo contains an undisclosed mixture of various scent chemicals and ingredients that were used as fragrance dispersants such as diethyl phthalate. The specific chemicals found in the fragrance or parfum do not have to be disclosed in the ingredient listing, because it is viewed as a trade secret.FOR REAL. GOOGLE IT.If you use Bath & Body Works or traditional, chemical-laden products you become desensitized to the smell and the damaging effects of these things over time (and these probably won’t bother you). I do not use any products with added fragrance and haven’t for years so any time I’m exposed to something like this, it’s like a punch to the nose and an instant headache (my husband also agrees). If you also avoid chemical-laden products and want to know 100% what’s in the products you put in your hair and on your body—this is NOT the product for you. (And SheaMoisture’s other products also have the vague and ominous “fragrance” in the ingredients so this brand is probably not for you either.) If you don’t care about that kind of thing, you’ll probably like it fine. Just a heads up for anyone out there who’s careful about their products’ ingredients."

0,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Feel like it was tampered with and watered down,"Really disappointed in this. I have gotten it before from a store and loved it.  I ordered this on Amazon and am convinced the package was tampered with.  The seal on top was cheap and popped off easily.  It looked like one you would find on one of those “cruise booze” shampoo bottle seals that wasn’t really sealed down and just pressed on top. The shampoo itself was VERY watery and thin, with a light scent. This Shea moisture product (the one I previously bought in a store) was a very thick shampoo with a great (and strong smelling) scent. There is no way this wasn’t tampered with.  I threw it out immediately. I wish I would have taken a picture but I didn’t.  Be careful when purchasing beauty/hair products online apparently."
1,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dry, knots, breakage, MESS!",This product made my hair soooo dry. My hair never really gets knotty. Like ever. I would only need to finger brush it at most. But after using this product my hair was SO dry and SO frizzy! My curls were so sad. I couldn’t even run my fingers in hair past my ears because it was just knots every where. I would also have to use up to 10 pumps of this conditioner to coat my mid shoulder length 2C hair. This was NOT what I expected after using the same line of Shea products leave in deep conditioning treatment
2,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased!,"I have very coarse thick 4C hair.  My crown is the driest and as a result very brittle.  I have been searching for a shampoo that would add moisture.  This shampoo did just that.  I took a chance because I have tried other lines from Shea Moisture with terrible results but this shampoo was made for my hair, its texture and its thirst for moisture.  Now I have the leave in and the conditioner.  Thank Goodness I found something that works for my hair."
3,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do Not Buy,"I used the shampoo and conditioner and it left my hair very dry.  I do not have thick or curly hair and in fact, when I purchased this product, I thought it might be too heavy on my hair but just the opposite.  My hair felt and looked like straw."
4,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stripping,Idk what’s up with every shampoo these days I’m about to use a facial cleanser on my hair cuz all these shampoos keep drying my scalp/ stripping my hair.
5,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap fake perfume smell is awful. Not Shea honey goodness as described.,"Purchased because of all the wonderful natural sounding components, however this smells like my grandma's 50 year old Avon perfume. Smells nothing like any Shea hair products I've ever had. Fake perfume smell is so bad I will never use."
6,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Had a funky smell to it.,I've been buying this Conditioner from Sally's beauty and it smelled amazing! So when I saw it on Amazon I was thrilled. Buyers beware... When I received this and used it the smell was absolutely off from the product I buy at the store. It was a foul smell almost as if it was expired?
7,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,100% RECOMMEND!,"I’m a stickler for quality in a product. If something doesn’t perform well, it gets canned. For a while, I’ve been trying to find a natural, cruelty/sulfate/paraben/artificial fragrance-free shampoo that is high-quality and decently affordable. I bought this on a whim, and after two months of use, it has proven itself to be a great purchase and it’s my new go-to for shampoo. Using this shampoo, a little truly goes a long way - I can rely on a thorough clean with LESS THAN a dime size of product. This formula replenishes & maintains moisture without making your hair too greasy/weighing hair down."
8,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,strips and irritates,"I've tried the moisture retention shampoo from Shea Moisture before and loved it. I wanted to love this too, but this shampoo dries out my hair and irritates my scalp. Like so bad. I don't know what happened, but Shea Moisture did not nail this one. Go back to better ingredients please?"
9,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curls,Daughter loves these products for her curly hair.
10,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Why is it brown?!,"I’ve been using this conditioner for almost a year now and LOVE it. When I realized I was almost out, I decided to order more so I could get it fast, and ignored the reviews about this being a counterfeit product. Bad idea! This bottle came unsealed with conditioner leaking out AND it’s brown! Every other bottle I’ve had was pure white. It looks like it’s been tampered with and I am not about to lather this on my head."
11,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair is constantly improving! Partially due to this!,A few months in using this on my long curly hair! It is an absolutely is a game changer. I started loosely following the curly girl method and my hair has grown so much and all of the hair I lost from psoriasis being on my scalp for so long is coming back due to using better products. My hair is constantly getting better and I’m so close to my goal of bum length hair! I think it’ll be maybe a year or two more before it gets there. My baby hairs are all getting to ear lobe length tho so they are also growing fast! Thank goodness for people who actually know stuff about hair on the internet!
12,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,New fav shampoo,My hair is 4B/high porosity for the naturalistas who like to know. I have been using this shampoo for a few months and love it. I normally like a squeaky clean feel after a shampoo but found my hair was getting too dry. This shampoo is a great middle ground and leaves my hair/scalp feeling clean but not stripped. My hair also feels soft and fluffy after rinsing. It smells amazing! I also use the deep conditioner and both leave my hair smelling so good. Overall would recommend for all natural hair types.
13,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shea moisture is awesome,I've used this shampoo for a while. It works really well and the scent is nice but not to strong which is good. It's not overly thick and not liquidity either.  This in combination with the conditioner and hair mask saved my damaged hair.
14,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Poor shipping, good product","So far I love the product after first use, however, the shipping packaging was very poor and some product had leaked out."
15,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Wonderful moisture without the weight
16,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for dry scalp,"This shampoo is truly good for dry scalp. Your hair will shine after using it. The small flakes largely go away. I imagine this product is also good for people with thinner hair who value strengthening. My hair sheds significantly less using this shampoo than most others as well. I like the smell. I appreciate that it's affordable and made using clean ingredients. As a guy with thick hair, I think it's harder to style my hair after using this product. For most people with dry scalp (and no dandruff), this is should be a good buy."
17,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,arrived with seal broken and leaking,"Had this mailed to my mom, and it arrived with the lid loose and the seal broken and leaking enough to have the outside of the bottle covered mostly in the shampoo. I'm not requesting a refund or a new bottle as it wasn't the whole bottle or even half of it.  Just beware.  I've not tried it yet, as I just got to my mom's and not tried this shampoo before.  I'll have to update after a few washes for that info."
18,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite shampoo,"They seemed to take the reviews seriously, and my shampoo came with a seal and wrapped in plastic to keep the cap on firmly. I adore this shampoo. The scent to me is definitely similar to perfume, but I enjoy it and think it is a very warm scent. I’ve tried many other shampoos, even from the same company, and nothing seems to leave my hair as soft and manageable as this one. I keep coming BACK to this shampoo. I can definitely manage to limit my washes without my hair getting greasy from any left behind residue. It is thinner, but I like that it is. As someone who has A LOT of hair, I find that this product lathers nicely and is easily spread, so I find myself using less shampoo than I typically would. I have natural thick and wavy hair (natural beach waves and some loose spiral curls), that can never decide what it wants to do. I definitely notice that with this shampoo my waves are more defined and don’t tangle as easy."
19,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Same great scalp care with great new scent,"I’ve been using the tan version of this conditioner, the matching shampoo, and Nizoral to keep my dermatitis in check with great success. I decided to try this new version because I have the option to subscribe with Amazon and the results are the same, if not better. Also, this version is scented like flowers, which I actually like because the older version, while it smelled nice (like soft shea butter), did not hide the smell of the Nizoral very well for me."
20,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,I will forever use one of their hair products. My hair was dry and breaking. After a month of using their shampoo and conditioner sets I began to see the difference of no breakage and my hair stayed more moisturized. And the scents are great. I love it! I use it on my children as well.

   My hair loves the manuka honey line from Shea moisture so it works very well for me however don’t expect to get the full package mine came spilt and bent out of shape I only got half of the bottle the rest was left in the package or came in not to mention the pump broke off"
22,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,This would probably be perfect for someone else's hair.,"This product is just too heavy and greasy for my fine hair and oily scalp.  In general, I think highly of Shea Moisture's products, and am guessing that it would be perfect for someone with a dry scalp and an abundance of dry hair."
23,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,"Excellent for use after a hair straightening for curly hair. It helps restore the moisture in my wavy curly hair and has a soft scent. I use it along with the protein mask and works great. I only use it occasionally though because I heard protein overload can happen with too much use. Great find on here, a tad cheaper than at the store."
24,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"I got Thier beard oil and was very impressed, so much so I a bit the bullet and got this shampoo.  I was weary because of the price point but a little goes a long way which off sets that some and wow what an excellent shampoo.  I couldn't be more pleased and am extremely happy with it"
25,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,"Love everything shea mositure makes. Great good for you ingredients with real results. This conditioner is lightweight, washes out easy and keeps my hair tangle free. I have bleached and damaged hair so it is important that I get a nourishing conditioner, and this is it. Smells like honey."
26,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If the bottle wasn’t damaged, I’d put 5 stars.","I LOVE THE SMELL! But I am not happy with how the product arrived. Trash in the bubble envelope. The bottle was obviously dropped on the lid- the seal was broken- which makes me not want to use it, the lid was lopsided when put back on; probably because the thread on the lid was busted."
27,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smoothing!,"This has really helped to smooth and relax my frizzy hair. This conditioner has been a life saver since I started using it. My hair has a mixture of different curl types but nothing too curly and might be considered more wavy. However, I have a very frizzy top layer of hair. This conditioner has solved all my frizzy and dry problems. When I blow dry I can get away without straightening it if I want and I can actually let my hair air dry and have a similar texture throughout now!"
28,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Give yogurt a chance. 😌,"I have used this product line’s Manuka honey shampoo and conditioner for the last two years and decided to give this formulation a try. I am so glad I did. This formula is rich and since I am wearing my hair naturally curly right now, easy of distribution is a factor. I am buying it again."
29,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Manufacturer recommended this for my type hair, but nope!","I was emailing the manufacturer back and forth because they had discontinued the line of products that worked on my Type 2B hair. This is awful. I have blonde hair, thin, and wavy. This shampoo flattened everything out. Did the opposite of what the discontinued line did.I don't recommend this product at all."
30,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,absolute no,This conditioner is making my hair fall out more than usual and it has made my hair dry and brittle. Small bottle too. Horrible conditioner.
31,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good on 3c hair,I love the smell & it makes my hair very soft! I’m 3c hair!
32,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love shea moisture,"This came packaged well, no leakage.

34,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful,This is my all time favorite conditioner. I started going back to curly and co-washing my hair about 2 years ago and i have been trying almost every conditioner there is and this one is one of the best.
35,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very thick and the smell is strong but it's not a bad scent.,The only that I wish was different was that it wasn't in a hand pump. It's thick and luxurious and it takes 17 pumps to give me the amount I want for my hair. Would much rather have a tube to squeeze out. Other than that this stuff works great on my hair. I think I found my new conditioner. Waiting for the shampoo to give a review too
36,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff,"Love this stuff. So hydrating and moisturizing, and smells amazing! Good for curly, thick, or very dry hair. Probably wouldn’t be good for fine, thin, or oily hair though!"
37,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Drying, There’s Better Out There",Its really not that moisturizing and doesn’t have much of a noticeable scent.

38,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for curls,So creamy and luscious!

42,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works, but needs better packaging","The product works great, it’s just Amazon needs to work on care for the bottle. Little bit of shampoo was dripping out and little into plastic bag. The product is 5 stars, but packaging needs to be little better. It hydrated your hair really good, with an awesome sweet smelling in your hair."

136,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ruined my favorite brand,"The last three scents - sativa, castor oil, manuka honey and yogurt - I have bought from three different stores (two pharmacy chains and one big box chain) have ALL been WATERY and horrible.  This has been my favorite brand for 8 years, but at the price, I can't keep wasting money on watered down product.  I don't know what happened to the rich, luxurious shampoo that my family loved.  Pour this in your hand and watch your money seep through your fingers and down the drain."
137,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good. Was told that hair looked dry and mangled after usage!,"I’m sure a lot of people get good results from this, but my experience is far from it. I used the shampoo conditioner before going to work one day and wore it in a pony tail. I was trying so hard to like my results just to feel like I didn’t waste my money, and I asked a coworker of what she thought of my hair and she said it didn’t look as good as it always does. It stripped me of my moisture and did the exact opposite. It made it sticky and little to no volume. I have 2a/2b medium curly hair that’s been highlighted. I don’t reccomend if your hair is similar to mine."
138,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works well for my hair,"Highlights has made my hair thinner and brittle. I got this small pack and used it 3 times. My hair has gotten better than it was. It's somewhat hydrated, less dry and smells great. The smell is not too strong, and the ingredients in this is really good. I'll keep using this treatment more times."
139,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for hydration. Highly recommend for natural hair!,"Love all Shea Moisture products. This one works well, great consistency, so easy to apply and wash out. Leaves hair hydrated and soothed. I use it along with the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter shampoo and the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter hair mask as well. All work very well for my natural hair."
140,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Great Great!,Love it. I use the whole line (the conditioner and the hair mask). They leave my hair feeling soft and hydrated. Also prepare it nicely for styling. Can't be happier.
141,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Shipping,"I needed this order shipped to me this week because I am in desperate need for conditioner. It said it would arrive by the 25th, and everyday it says it is going to come later. Now it's supposed to arrive by October 6...thats in a week. The entire reason why I ordered this conditioner was because it was going to arrive here soon."
142,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good!,I got this from another store but i agree with low ratings that its not for 2a/b type of hair. It leaves some kind of coating on your hair and weighs them down.
143,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Nope!!!,"Ewww this stuff sucks! The smell is really strong and does nothing for the hair ( Thick , course , semi wavy ) it’s not creamy, it’s not softening and worse it dried my hair and leaves residue!!!!"
144,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Smell is Vile and Makes Hair Dry and Unmanageable,"I bought this conditioner when the store recommended for dry and damaged hair.  First, the smell was annoying and perfumey.  I had to rewash my hair to get away from it.  It left my hair feeling dirty, encrusted and even dryer than before.  This stuff was a disaster.

150,SheaMoisture Hydrate & Repair Conditioner for Damaged Hair Manuka Honey & Yogurt Shea Butter 13 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not as clean and healthy as they seem—ingredients include “fragrance” & they REEK OF PERFUME!!,"If you’re looking for a healthy, clean, natural shampoo and conditioner without added chemical junk—THIS IS NOT THE BRAND FOR YOU. I decided to try these SheaMoisture products which were recommended by a friend after my own shampoo and conditioner became impossible to find. I thought they looked lavishly moisturizing and were a very clean/healthy option based on the marketing. I somehow missed that the list of unhealthy additives they don’t use did not include “fragrance.” Holy moly...I read another review on here that described the perfume smell of these products as an old Avon perfume their grandmother used to wear. I probably would’ve ignored that review before actually smelling these products but WOW did she hit the nail on the head. My shampoo came damaged and leaking in the package and the little bit that coated the container has made my entire bathroom and hallway smell to high heaven of hardcore perfume ever since it arrived. And it’s never actually been opened. My hand, just from touching the leaked bottle, smelled strongly of the stuff for an entire day despite multiple washings with strong soap. I cannot even imagine walking around with a head full of hair smelling like this stuff. It’s an instant headache trigger for me which is a strong indicator of chemicals. I checked the ingredients and sure enough, there was the culprit—“fragrance (essential oil blend).”DID YOU KNOW: If the ingredient listing says fragrance or parfum, this means the shampoo contains an undisclosed mixture of various scent chemicals and ingredients that were used as fragrance dispersants such as diethyl phthalate. The specific chemicals found in the fragrance or parfum do not have to be disclosed in the ingredient listing, because it is viewed as a trade secret.FOR REAL. GOOGLE IT.If you use Bath & Body Works or traditional, chemical-laden products you become desensitized to the smell and the damaging effects of these things over time (and these probably won’t bother you). I do not use any products with added fragrance and haven’t for years so any time I’m exposed to something like this, it’s like a punch to the nose and an instant headache (my husband also agrees). If you also avoid chemical-laden products and want to know 100% what’s in the products you put in your hair and on your body—this is NOT the product for you. (And SheaMoisture’s other products also have the vague and ominous “fragrance” in the ingredients so this brand is probably not for you either.) If you don’t care about that kind of thing, you’ll probably like it fine. Just a heads up for anyone out there who’s careful about their products’ ingredients."

0,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works amazing but is a ripoff on Amazon. Go to Ulta!!,"Works great. My hair was dying for moisture and I was about to chop the ends off but decided to try this before I went to extreme measures. I shampooed my scalp and then put this from mid hair shaft to the ends and left it on for 15 minutes. I rinsed with cool water and combed through with my fingers (NO TANGLES GUYS!!). I squeezed excess water out and scrunch Dried my hair in an old t-shirt and let air dry. My frayed, frizzy and literally dead ends have shape, shine and bounce to them after just one use. I’ll probably mask once a week for month just to try to give my hair extra love and then go down to masking it every other or every third week. But this isa RIP OFF on Amazon. Ulta has the exact same thing for $12 and they are Buy One Get one 40% off so really you could get two of these for the price that amazon is asking for one. That’s why I gave it 4 stars because it’s so expensive on here."

6,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fine damaged curly hair changer!,Perfect protein treatment for my fine damaged curly hair.I have really fine high porosity damaged curly hair (3b-c) due the use of hair dyes and bleaching my hair was really damaged and even started to changed pattern it looked wavy and I even had some straight strands of hair and it was harder to keep it curly and untangled (not to mention I had hair loss)  but then I changed all my hair products and started to search what worked better for my lost curly hair that's when I read about the protein and their importance on the hair well basically our hair is made of protein and then I found this product.To be honest I wasn't expecting any magical result but I was looking to stop loosing my curly pattern and just continue cutting my damaged hair till grow out all damaged curls but... just 3 weeks after using this treatment and the manuka honey & yogurt leave-in spray and my hair has changed dramatically I can now see again 80% of my 3b curls not just that but everytime I use this treatment my hair feels stronger and strangely thicker (i know this may be impossible but it feels more dense on my hands) . Just 1 week ago i added olaplex 3 which also has help me but the biggest change to me was the Manuka Honey & Yogurt from Shea Moisture I'm so tempted to buy the Shampoo and conditioner cause my hair feels healthier and looks amazingly curly again.I've tried other protein treatments in the past including Aphogee but they didn't work so well for me  I know this product may not work for everyone but to me was a game changer. Yes I'll still be cutting the ends of my hair to get rid of my damaged hair but I'm really happy to see a lot of my curls again (^-^)NOTE: This is a protein treatment not a hair mask and eventhough you will feel your hair softer and stronger it doesn't give extra moisture to the hair so you'll also have to look for a hair mask to give your hair that extra moisture boost (^-*)

I open the jar and found it was not hermetically sealed.AND it looks as if a large chunk of the product is missing!!

I would highly recommend it!,"This might be my favorite Shea Moisture product and definitely my favorite hair mask from them. I have tried a few of their other masks and I was not impressed so I was not expecting much with this one but it blew me away.ABOUT MY HAIR:I have type 3a and 3c hair. My hair is low porosity. It is shoulder length and it is very fine. My main problems are moisture, frizz, volume and lately definition.MY HAIR PROBLEM:I had tried to revive the definition of my hair. My hair was very limp and stringy. Also, certain products made my hair stiff and dry. I was struggling.REVIEW:I felt in like the first time I used it. My hair felt soft and moisturized. I did not transform my hair or anything but there was a definite difference. My hair was more alive and it gave me hope.After a few more uses, it gave my hair more definition and I was able to wear my hair out more. It was a great step toward the recovery of my hair.I finished it and my hair looks so much better and I would most definitely repurchase in the future."

11,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for Curly Girls,"It's expensive for an 8oz container. But this product works! It is amazing on curly hair. It is a protein treatment which is very intense, so you SHOULD NOT do this every day or even every week. Most people do protein treatments once a month. I have high porosity hair and I just started doing protein treatments for the first time in years so I personally will probably do this every OTHER week and see how my hair takes it. For someone else I would suggest ONCE a month.The product has a really thick consistency like the Shea moisture manuka honey and mafura oil intensive hydration mask but has a smooth consistency and is white.The smell is a little hard to describe. It is very pleasant and sweet like some kind of dessert. I'm not sure the scent will stay on your hair once washed off especially if you put other products in it.For reference, I have type 3c/4a color treated, high prorosity hair. (My hair was high prorosity before dying)"

I use a big dollop of this when I use my hair steamer.  After about 15 minutes of steaming, my hair has absorbed most of it leaving very little to rinse out.  My hair is softer and more compliant when using.  My only complaint is that it has honey which acts as a humectant and in very humid weather if I have not rinsed it all out my hair does get some frizz."

I use it about once or twice a month, and if I go too long without it, I can definitely start noticing the difference. With this treatment, my curls are more defined and less frizzy, and my hair doesn't tangle nearly as much. I hope Shea Moisture never stops making it."

   I don’t write a lot of Amazon reviews but this product is amazing! I left it on longer than instructed (1-2 hours) and my hair is so soft and shiny when it was really dry before. It also looks like I have products in it when there’s none at all. Only thing I don’t like is that the container is really small for the price. And I have a lot of hair so I used most the the container one time. But other than that I would definitely recommend this to other curly hair people like myself! Love it!"

I have never used a hair mask regularly before but now I will be using this once a week! Never realized how dry my hair was compared to how it feels now after using this hair mask! The first time I used it I left it in for over 8hrs which is not recommended but I was working from home so I thought why not! The ingredients are amazing so leaving it in longer didn’t harm my hair at all! My hair seriously feels like I just got a hair cut it’s so soft!!Also I had my sister try it bc she was saying how dead her hair was and that she needed to get a keratin treatment which is super expensive Or chop 4 inches off bc it was so dead! But after trying this she said it really defrizzed her hair and made it super soft! She will no longer being getting the keratin treatment and is now hooked on this mask!!

I have very wavy/ kind of curly hair that l loves protein and hates too much moisture. Most deep conditioners make it sad and lank. This product makes my hair soft and bouncy.

I use this once every week or two and have never felt over moisturized like I experienced with other deep conditioning treatments."

It's one woman who started this business and it's still in the family. I love the natural ingredients there are no you sulfates, parabens anything like that. These are great products at very very good prices.

Something that antisemitism works for me! "" I'm not claiming to have difficult hair, but I'm on my haircare journey and am finally finding things that work for me. So far this is pretty amazing. It strengthened my hair (weird thing to say I'm realizing but it doesn't feel as fragile when it dried) and there's a weight to it that holds down those fly aways. I'm waiting for the rest of the line I ordered but this item is a win for me. Oh and I have wavy/curly hair. My hair strands are on the thinner side but there's a lot of them which makes my hair thick. My hair is on the dryer side for the first 3 to 4 days then the oils naturally start to set in."

I’ve never used a hair mask before so I don’t have a lot to compare it to.  I will say this, I did the mask the night before I bleached my hair and right after I bleached with 30 volume.  My curl pattern doesn’t seem to have been effected by the bleach and there is no breakage.  This product is super thick, like grade school paste so I suggest you thoroughly wet your hair before applying otherwise it doesn’t want to move through your hair much.  I have Caucasian 3B curl pattern.  I’d probably buy it again."
24,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Huge hair changes.,"If used correctly, this is an amazing product. No matter how much moisture I added to my hair, it was just super ‘off’. It ended up that I wasn’t using a single product with protein, which was causing a huge hair funk. I started using this product after I co-washed (this product was far too thick for that) and experienced a huge hair rebound about half way through the first container. It may seem expensive for the amount of product you get, but it really doesn’t require that much. Try mixing it with a bit of warm water in your hand before adding to your hair if it feels too thick."

My hair is low porosity and so is my daughters. It’s so hard finding a product that doesn’t leave my hair feeling dry. I actually like this product though. My hair turned out alright, but I saw a dramatic change in my daughter’s hair. My daughter’s hair usually stays feeling dry, no matter what I do to it. Her hair no longer looks or feels dry. I’m very impressed."

One I got from Walmart is much better than this one I got from this seller. I doubted this when I noticed the product was wrapped with plastic and it was more oily when I opened the container. It looked like they just poured the cream on some oil. But the one I used before was very good and wasn't so oily it was more creamy. This product I received is more like ointment.
27,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Does NOT contain Manuka honey,"I have been a loyal Shea Moisture customer for 6 years, but this is unacceptable. Trust is such an important aspect for customers and this is the first time I see SM lie about their products. They should change the name to something different because after carefully reading the ingredients, I realized this product does NOT contain any Manuka honey, just plain honey as one of the ingredients towards the middle. I like that the treatment is super thick and it did feel very moisturizing when I put it on my hair. I don't like being lied to, though. If they changed the name I would purchase it again."

Then I noticed my hair was getting frizzy after using it, and looked at the ingredients. This product has 2 different waxes in it's ingredients, that are not listed when you look at the photos. Of course it is to late to do anything about it, and I can't even use a $10 product because it has wax in it."
29,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Better as a pre-shampoo conditioner than stand alone,"It smells like baby powder, which isn’t the worst but if you’re particular about scents then you might not like it. I love how thick this formula is but ended up using it more for a pre shampoo conditioner. Without shampoo afterwards, it leaves a film in your hair that is very thick and weights it down. Though after washing it out and even before adding another conditioner, my hair definitely felt softer and more moisturized. I have very curly dry hair, so I need as much moisture as I can get! I didn’t love it enough as a pre-poo too but it again especially considering the cost. And I definitely wouldn’t use it as a mask or deep conditioner alone unless you want a fill in your hair after you rinse."
30,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for strength, not softness","This hair mask is great if you have high porosity hair (curly, bleached, chemically altered in general), but is is not hydrating.It will help recover the fiber of the hair, making strong and recovering elasticity. But if you are looking to get your hair soft,, shiny, easy to comb through, this is not the product for you. If that is your case, go for a hydrating mask, like Phyto's jojoba, for instance. I'd also recommend following a regime that will help you treat your hair in steps (I do 1 protein treatment, 2 hydration, 1 oil treatments, 2 hydrations, and start over). Good mask overall. 👍"
31,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Do you believe in miracles?,"Holy crap! My hair gets very dry (Caucasian, long, wavy, untreated hair), and it was getting to the point where it felt almost crunchy. I saw a BuzzFeed list that recommended this product, and it did not disappoint.I saw an IMMEDIATE change in my hair, and it suddenly feels hydrated and healthy. A little goes a long way - I only use this once every 2 weeks, because it is so effective. I bought this six months ago, and I still have plenty left. Truly incredible."
32,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"YOU MUST BUY FOR DRY HAIR, NO KIDDING","So I got this product for my mom that has a mix of a 3b and 3c hair curl pattern and LET ME TELL YOU. After lightening and getting highlights over the last couple of years, her hair had the same texture as a Brillo pad. Her hair felt crunchy and would have lots of breakage and after she washes and conditions her hair, right out of the shower, her hair would seem desperate for moisture and it would frizz up immediately without even towel drying it. After she used this conditioner and let it sit in her hair for about 30 minutes, oh my GOSH it helped it sooo much. Her hair doesn’t frizz up as much, her curl pattern is actually visible now and it’s calm. I ended up buying one for myself at my local beauty store and sheesh THE RESULTS TO NOT LIE. Where has this stuff been all my life :’) ?!"

I have used it twice as a prewash moisture treatment and really liked the results. It left my hair nicely moisturized, decent shine, and soft without removing curl. It's very thick to apply and you need to emulsify in your hands before applying. It will last along time."
34,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best of Shea Moisture!,"I’ve been using this for about 6 months now and this is the best deep conditioner I’ve ever used on my type 4 hair. My hair has instant softness as soon as it’s applied. After 30 minutes under a heated cap, my hair is moisturized and strong. Breakage and shed hairs are also drastically reduced! In my opinion, it’s better than the JBCO, the Manuka Honey, and (my previous favorite) the High Porosity deep conditioner. The container is smaller than other Shea Moisture deep conditioners, but it makes up for it by how thick and creamy it is. A little goes a long way."
35,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked really well!,"I bought this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner. Using all 3 together left me with smooth, fat, and juicy curls. My hair was damaged from pandemic cuts I did on myself. I used regular office shears and mini Wahl clippers. As a result the texture of my hair was very rough and jagged. I am very pleased with the results. This deep conditioner has a very, very thick consistency, like a butter. It is white in color, has a pleasant light fragrance, and feels very rich. My curly hair was able to blow dry perfectly straight after using the 3 products together. I would buy this again."

Recently I've learned to love my curls and this protein helped define them and repair my hair damaged by years of straightening it. After the first application, I noticed a huge change in my hair texture and my curls are coming back. I would totally recommend this!!"

First of all it smells so incredible you could just eat it. The day it arrived I made everyone in my life smell it, and I had it up to my nose every waking second. It's a very thick rich buttery product that soaks right into the hair and leaves it feeling like satin when rinsed out. Gives my curly hair extra definition too. I will never use another treatment as long as this is available."

I did leave it on for about a hour instead of 15 minutes but that had more to do with forgetting the time."
39,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,You probably need this product!,"I had no idea how damaged my hair was from years of bleaching, blow drying, straightening etc. It wasn't until the COVID quarantine that I realized how much I have neglected my natural curls. On the photo on the left you can see the ""halo"" of frizz and broken hair I had acquired over the years. NOTHING would work. After one use of this product that halo is gone! My curls are more defined than ever.Even if you dont realize it, your hair is probably damaged. I suggest trying this product!As a side note, I have bad allergies to perfumes and products ...this product scent was very light and did not bother me."

So my curls definitely took a beating because of this. But this mask seriously helped. It’s super thick and I usually use it with my olaplex treatment and it leaves my hair silky smooth and rejuvenated my curls :> really nice and I’ve  rebought this at least 5 times now.

I have extremely thick wavy/curly hair and now I exclusively use this as a normal conditioner 1-2 times a week. It really nourishes and hydrates my hair and I notice a big difference when I use this product vs. others. If you have wavy/curly hair I also highly recommend checking out the curly girl method! Has helped a ton with my hair that I dont even have to use heat tools anymore or excessive amounts of (after shower) products.

I'm growing out a relaxer and the texture of my hair was unrecognizable to me. I used this and kept it on about 15 mins in the shower, no cap. I rinsed it out and my hair immediately began going back to my naturally wavy texture.  I still had tangles but it looked so much better. I used it again the next morning in the shower and this time blew my hair dry and my hair was so soft and smelled so good. Nowhere near as much breakage.This stuff works wonders."

I have thick color treated hair, high porosity and medium to high density. I first used this as a pre-shampoo treatment on slightly damp hair and left it on for an hour then rinsed and proceeded to wash, style etc and my hair LOVES this treatment. I can't imagine better results. It really encourages my curls and my hair is soft and bouncy when I use this weekly. I also just yesterday used it as a treatment on my wet hair in the shower. I washed and conditioned and then applied the rest of what I had in the container (it was nearly out). I applied this mid shaft to ends. I left it on only about 5 minutes. I rinsed it out and didn't need a leave in. I styled my usual way and was so thrilled with the way my hair turned out!!"

I loved how moisturizing it was and decided to finally buy the deep conditioner.  It left my hair feeling smooth and moisturized.  My curls were popping after I used the conditioner.  So glad I decided to try this product.  I thought it was a little pricey for the size but I didn't use as much as I thought I would.  The product is thick and a little goes a long way.This will be my staple protein conditioner.  It didn't leave my hair feeling dry or course, even though it is a protein treatment.

Since my hair is so thick and long, I was only able to get about three good uses out of it.  I hope that there are larger portions for sale, because I really love how this product made my hair feel.  The price was okay, but the price for the amount wasn’t enough for my hair.  If Shea Moisture has a larger jar for sale, I will definitely add this this my hair care routine."

My favorite.,"I love this product. I work in fast food and sometimes my hair in not quite dry when I get into work. So, it made my hair dry, brittle, and frizzy. It actually killed a lot of my hair. I needed to use something and someone told me to use this. I used it and it made a world of difference. I came out of the shower and is was nice a silky. It stayed that way for a while, so I brought it for myself.The best way that I have used it so far is to wet your hair then put it in. Then wash your body and shave or whatever your routine is and then wash out the treatment. I'm already ordering another!"

It was waxy, oily, and, heavy. And, it left a weird waxy residue on my hair and scalp. I’ve tried other protein treatments and have never dealt with so much weird buildup. Try the Castor Oil mask instead.Bottom line: Waste of time and money. I had to shampoo 3x to remove the waxy buildup."

I literally sit in the shower and rub it in my hands and smell it for like a whole minute straight, it is extremely extremely moisturizing. This would be great for naturally dry hair and extremely damaged hair. I once left a little in my hair as a leave in conditioner and when I dryed my hair it was super shiny and oily looking, so def wash it out properly, also I have healthy hair I just got it for the smell to be honest"

After bleaching my thick, curly hair, it was thin, dry, and brittle, and had the most loose curl pattern I've ever experienced. After one treatment, I could tell my hair was well nourished. It became much softer and easier to moisturize. After about three times of using it (along with a few deep conditions/hair masks) my hair was completely back to its normal curl pattern/texture! I only use it about once a month now, but my hair always feels so much better after. It's also thick, so it lasts a surprisingly long time. I absolutely recommend this product"

I love that this smells soooo good while it does a fantastic job at moisturizing and softening my hair.  Thankfully it's white and won't stain or yellow my natural silver coming in.  I use it once or twice a month as an intensive treatment. I apply the product and put a shower cap over, leaving it on as long as possible.  You could definitely use it more often if you need to."

I needed something to give more moisture to my hair. My hair after the mask was so soft and didnt feel dry., not even the ends. After 3 days my hair still feels soft and moisturized. I will definitely be ordering more. The scent is very subtle and is a nice smell. I have long hair and can get 3 moisture treatments out of this size. 8oz."

The formula is thick and rich, and a little goes a long way. I like the smell, and so far am very satisfied with the conditioning properties. I've never used it before, so I can't compare it to the previous formula that other reviewers have mentioned... but it seems great to me and I'm very satisfied with it.

I am trying to encourage my natural 2B wave and needed to start doing deep moisture/protein treatments.  2 days after use, and my waves haven't fallen out, as they usually do.

My hairdresser actually recommended it to me. I apply it every other week and leave on the directed amount of time. My itchy dry scalp and dandruff have disappeared and I feel like my hair is softer and healthier. My only complaint is that the scent is a very strong perfume smell.  I actually like the scent, but it is just very strong and I can smell myself throughout the day.  If that’s what it takes for beautiful hair and healthy scalp, then it’s worth it!"

This one takes work to untangle and left my hair feeling heavy and not clean.  My daughter-in-law uses this brand for her curly hair and recommended it.  I was looking for something cheaper than what I currently use so was willing to give it a try.  My hair is also thick and curly but it must be drier than hers because it didn’t work the same.

When I say damaged, I mean I genuinely thought my only option was about to be to shave off all my hair. The most damaged parts of my hair felt like straw, and would barely even get wet when I got in the shower - it was dry to the point where it repelled water. When I read that this product ""fixes up to 76% of damage within the first use"", I was skeptical, but I tried it. And y'all... it's too good to be true. It brought my hair back to life. My hair is softer, my curls are healthier, my hair is moisturized and takes to water/moisture so much easier. This is a Godsend."

First of all, you don’t need a lot of product in order for it to be effective. I have very thick hair, and if I wet my hair slightly before applying this mask, about a tablespoon is enough to lightly coat it.  I usually leave it on for around 30 minutes then wash my hair as usual in the shower.  It smells divine and is not heavy on the hair. I often use this mask in conjunction with a deep moisturizing mask which I alternate once a week."

I have every thick dense hair and I thought I’d use it like that but it lasted me about 3 months. I used it twice a week and it leaves my hair so soft and hydrated. Plus it’s smells amazing and the scent stays on very well. This is my new holy grail and the price is perfect
81,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Will purchase again!,I absolutely love this to make my hair soft and smooth.

When I am going to detangle my curls it’s soooo soft and easy that I barely loose hair and I don’t need to waste a lot of conditioner.This has become a must in my curly hair routineI noticed that my hair is very moisturized and that helps a lot with my curl definition
85,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair is saved!,This product saved my hair! I have high porosity hair and realized my hair really needed protein. I love Shea Moisture products so I was excited to try this. I used this one day as a deep conditioner and it revitalized my curls. My hair is a lot softer and my products hold so much better. I’d definitely recommend this product.
86,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing has helped my split ends like this does,"I have fine, thin hair and my ends split so easily. I'm tired of having to cut my hair because of awful split ends when I'm trying to grow it out. I decided to give this a try and it smelled good and it actually got rid of my split ends! I wash my hair a lot so I've had it just for a couple weeks and I've used it one time per week. I can already see a change in my hair and I have way fewer split ends. I'm going to continue using it once a week for another few weeks then I'll probably change to every couple weeks. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product. Also, it smells good so that's always a huge bonus!"
87,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh.,Read the reviews and thought this would be the answer to helping revive my treated hair. The results were lackluster and my hair was not any different after using it a few times. I've gotten better results from the individual packets from the grocery store. Going to stick with those from now on

90,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Curly Girl Method Approved-Has Wax in it now,I never got to use this product. As soon as I got it I checked the ingredients and the one I received has beeswax and carnauba (another wax). I have been using the Curly Girl method on my hair and this is NOT APPROVED anymore. The ingredients reported by Amazon are approved but apparently the formula has changed where I cannot use it and Amazon needs to update their description of ingredients. This is quite disappointing.

99,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The protein be weak, but strong enough to strengthen","This is a very mild protein, but my hair cant handle as much as others - so its perfect for me personally. The smell is pretty yuck, but it doesnt linger once washed out so its a small price to pay. Its formulated without so many harsh chemicals I see in products these days so thats a huge win. Will definitely use the whole tub, but I question if I'll try something new or stick with it when the time comes"

105,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but ingredient list is not accurate.","This product works great, but the ingredient list as it appears here (as well as on the Shea Moisture website) is incorrect. The new formula has two different waxes that can weigh hair down and cause a waxy build-up over time. If you follow the CGM it is no longer approved with the current formula. It looks like this has been a problem for almost a year but Shea Moisture has still not updated their ingredient list on Amazon or their own website."

108,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good!,"I couldn't figure out if this product could be used for Caucasian hair, but decided to try it anyway. I have thick, curly hair, and this stuff not only tames it but makes it shine! As a bonus, it smells soooo good too! I can compare this to Cantu's curl paste."
109,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great,I was worried this might have a feminine smell to it. It doesn't. it smells great. Does not leave a sticky feeling after you apply it. the hair remains moisturized almost all day.
110,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I think i was given a dupe..,There was no inner seal on the product. I used this as a replacement for the amazing(yet not CGM approved) Elizavecca CER-100 because this stuff is CGM approved. I have fine hair and the scent isn't pleasant and it's incredibly thick making it hard to soften down in order to spread through my hair. Just woke up after using it last night and my hair feels drier than normal. I think I'll just stick to Elizavecca CER-100
111,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to detangle,Love the smell and it was easy to detangle my hair with it.

114,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"This made my hair feel amazing, my little baby hair fly-aways behaved and I was able to wear my hair down without straightening it. My only complaint is that I have so much hair that I will probably only get three uses out of the container before I run out."
115,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best deep conditioner,This is my second jar my daughters hair loves it.

116,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it!!!!!!,"I bought this product based on a recommendation from the company I buy my extensions from. I used it on both my  mayvenn loose curl brown and natural hair. I left it on for over an hour on my natural hair and the recommended 5 minutes on my extensions. I was skeptical due to the thickness of the product but it worked well. Both, my hair and extensions were extremely soft. The one thing I would say is you have to wet your hair a few times while applying the product so that it’s not lying on top. I would definitely buy it again."
117,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,all i can say is wow!!,So i went to the hair salon to get blonde for the summer! well my hair got  fried and felt pretty nasty.

I rinced that out and then pot this stuff in and left it in my hair for 15 minutes then rinced with luke warm water. my hair feels so soft and amazing. doesnt feel dead at all. I will be purchasing again!!!!

120,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,What is this?,"Apart from being a Shea Moisture fan over the years, i cannot say a lot about this product. Don't get me wrong, i love their products but whit this one i'm not so sure. All i could see was the oils in one part of the bottle and the cream part in other. The package was a failure, it was leaking all over, so i cant barely use the product due to uncertainty of the one i received."

506,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad for protein sensitive hair (obviously),So I feel bad giving this product a bad review because I'm sure it's a great product but I realized after using it that my hair HATES protein. This product made my hair so dry and crunchy because my hair reacted to the protein. If your hair is protein sensitive then I recommend avoiding this product.
507,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Product from the HEAVENS!!!!!,"Let’s be very clear here. Since going back to relaxers I’m more educated and now very aware of products that state and claim that your hair will feel like this or that and with Shea products through the blogs the brand has always been extremely recommended for natural hair.....HOWEVER!!!!!! This product here bbaaabbbyy!!!!!Let me tell you. I once was natural but realized that wasn’t for me after 3 years and then got the big chopped and went back to relaxers. Store products which were very few were recommended by my beautician especially when I wasn’t able to get a appointment with her. I learned just because you have new growth does not mean to have to be a slave to a beauty salon or a relaxer for that matter. So I would allow my relaxers to go about 8 weeks. I did this once and my hair instantly start breaking off and my beautician stated it was because of the store bought products that I used outside of her recommendations. They would dry my hair out as if I never put a product in it, but this time around I said well let me go about 12 weeks out and then as I was about to relax it I said well let me trim it and wear a protective style. My hair had moisture from the products I was using but I seen myself slipping back down that slippery slope of breakage again. So I went out to Sally’s to buy a relaxer and should’ve known they wouldn’t have my brand/product that I prefer  but I turned around and seen this! Now I don’t know about you guys, but I will literally stop in the middle of the aisle and whip my phone out to see the reviews on the product. Let’s just say I’m moving into week 16 without an relaxer, hair moisturize, no breakage, shiny , feel strong and even my edges are slick!!!!! This is a MUST BUY and I recommend the moisture spray as well. Don’t be alarmed by the thickness of the product.. put a plastic cap on and wear for 15 min and rinse and there you go!!!!!"
508,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it somewhere cheaper but DEFINITELY BUY IT!!,"This same size is way cheaper at Ulta or Target so buy it from there but the product itself is amazing. My hair is transitioning from relaxed to natural and I have been looking for something to help with the breakage so I don't have to do the big chop. I use this a pre-wash treatment and it works wonders. My hair does not shed as much while washing and it stops the breakage after I style my hair. I wear my hair straight most days and before using this I couldn't even run my fingers through it without pieces breaking off. Now I can comb and style however I want & the difference is notable for at least 10 days or more. I wash my hair every two weeks and use this every time. Unlike other protein treatments, I don't find that it leaves my hair hard or dry but that also might be because of how I use it (pre-wash instead of post). I leave it on for about 30 min w/a plastic cap before I wash my hair and then rinse it out completely before I shampoo. My hair grows and I can trim the ends in manageable segments without having to cut so much at one time so I don't lose my length while transitioning. I don't like all of Shea Moisture's products but this is definitely a winner!!"
509,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,RIP-OFF,The product is amazing! BUT THIS IS A RIP-OFF. You can buy the exact same product + size at Ulta for $11.49.
510,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,MADE MY HAIR STINK,"Wife here: If you’re like me and you just read amazon reviews to see what people have to say about the product then that’s what this is. My review has nothing to do with the seller, or the authenticity of the product from this seller. I bought a container at Target and have used it a few times. It smells heavenly! I was so excited to try it. My hair felt great after using it. However, once my hair air dried I found that my hair smelled like a mans gym bag. It was gross. I’ve used this 5 or 6 times now! I may try it again, maybe with a different shampoo? Idk I can’t think why my shampoo or air drying my hair would make my hair smell this bad. I’ve only had my hair smell that bad after putting apple cider vinegar in it, but if you put something that smells bad in your hair your hair will smell bad, so I can’t imagine what’s going on here....If given a choice between frizzy, damaged hair for the rest of my life or having hair smell the way this product did I’d choose the damaged hair."
511,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,deep conditioner,"I purchased this product, as a sample, at ULTA Beauty.  I have used it for the last two weeks and it helps my hair.  I am a black woman with short, course, hair, that basically goes into an afro, no matter what I do.  I generally roll my hair up every night and when I go out, it just frizzes up.  Since I have been using this product, my curls are tighter, more defined and they hold.  Even when I exercise in the evening, the kinking is not too bad.  It is raining today in DC, Tuesday Nov 13 and the rain didn't even frizz my hair.  So, I would recommend this product.  I wash my hair with a moisturizing shampoo and then apply this for about 8 minutes, wash out, apply leave in and castor oil and roll my hair damp.  I have given up, trying to press it out.  This product makes my hair look as if it were pressed out.  Smells good also."
512,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved the product when I figured out how to use it!,"I recently had my hair bleached and wanted to look into products to help return moisture and protein to my hair after having it processed like that, because it felt a little dry and frail and frizzy. I purchased this through another retailer, and I've been really enjoying it! My hair feels softer than it did before I bleached it, evenI had trouble with it at first because I was trying to use too much product and fully saturating my hair, but after I started thinly applying it to my fingers and combing it through my curls instead of gobbing it on which left a crunchy cast and bad hair feeling, I had a lot of success! I'm really happy with the way my curls are behaving and how soft my hair feels after using it :)"
513,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product for curls!,"I normally don’t write reviews but this product is so amazing I just had to! I have a mixture of 3b and 3c curly hair and on my wash days I use this product as a deep conditioner. To really get the product in my hair follicles I apply it after I condition my hair and I leave it on and sit under a hooded hair dryer (the bonnet portable dryer) for about 15 minutes and then I rinse with lukewarm water, finally I dry my hair with a microfiber towel and instantly my curls are moisturized and super soft! It smells amazing and it lingers in my hair even after I’ve rinsed it off which I love!"
514,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Old lady perfume smell,I’m so surprised to see so many people saying they love the scent. It reminds me of old lady perfume and was so strong lingering in my hair that I became nauseous. Had to throw most of it away. I mean if ya like smelling like old lady perfume than this is for you!
515,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing and wonderful smell,"LOVE! Did not buy on Amazon but just wanted to leave a review. This product is amazing. I curl my hair with a curling wound every 2-3 days. My hair is color treated. It leaves my hair tangle free, light, and gives it a luster. Right now I am trying it overnight because my hair needs extra care."
516,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Did the opposite of what I wanted,"I’m not sure if this is because of my fine, wavy, low porosity hair type, but I found this product extremely heavy. The product was also really hard in the jar and I had to warm it in my hands to even distribute it. As soon as I rinsed it out my hair felt “off”- limp but not even moisturized. When it dried it was weighed down and more frizzy than usual. It felt like straw and it looked like I had split ends even though using different products my cuticle usually lays flat."
517,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fav Product in this Collection,The Protein Power Treatment is my favorite product from the Manuka Honey & Yogurt collection. It is SUPER THICK but I LOVE IT!!! It contains Shea butters and oils so it’s super hydrating. It smells amazing and It feels great in my hair. It has a slip feel to It and is perfect for those who really need a conditioning treatment.
518,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great deep conditioner!,Great deep conditioner!  I’ve been using this for several months and it really does moisturize my hair and put the softness back in. I have 4A type hair that is particularly dry and easily tangled. This isn’t a good detangler so it’s best to already have your hair detangled beforehand. Definitely give it try!
519,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,"Honestly I have seen so many comments about the product not being sealed, but if you buy it in walmart it’s not sealed either!

525,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged hair? This product is for you.,"I love using hair masks every so often- but they never feel truly beneficial to my hair. I didn’t realize that I had heat damage, and how dry my hair was from the dry winter. When i brushed my hair, it would break off a lot! I saw this product online, but decided to give it a try. WOW! The picture doesn’t do justice! Firstly, the product smells amazing. Not super perfumey or overpowering, but a sweet lasting scent. It made my hair SO soft, and helped a ton with the dryness. I do wish that there was a protective seal under the lid- but still an amazing product! Using this changed my hair, it looks and feels so much healthier now! :)"
526,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,4c high porosity approved,ok must start out by saying shea moisture was and will always be canceled EXCEPT for this deep conditioner. I refused to use their stuff since they changed years ago but ran across this in a desperate attempt to stop my severe like ...Severe extremely dry extreme breakage 4c high porosity hair and it literally helped by the first use!!! This never happens! I actually was rough with my hair in grabbing it cuz I was in disbelief. Now I realize that I cant use it like every 6 weeks most people can cuz my hair its going trough it so I realize the breakage starts right back up again if I don't use it 2x weekly. Not cheap and not happy but for now this is what i'll do until my own diy deep protein treatment creations work.
527,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,10/10,"This stuff is AMAZING. I am biracial with thick, unruly hair that is relaxed, and it’s always SO dry and brittle, no matter how much I moisturize. Like even when my hair soaking wet, you can just feel how dry it is, ya know? I used this once and my hair has done a complete 180. The jar says to leave it on for 10-15 minutes but I left it on for an hour, and even as I was just washing it out, I felt a HUGE difference. All I put on after was a leave-in conditioner and I let it air dry and OMG. It is SO soft and moisturized, it feels so much healthier after just one treatment, and it has this beautiful, healthy glow to it and I genuinely just feel like a new person! My dead ends have been revived and I feel so hopeful that I can restore some health to them with this. I have never had a product do so much in such a small amount of time and I am in LOVE. Definitely going to be to using this weekly at the least!"
528,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Baby’s first protein treatment.,"My hair is high-porosity and the texture shifts between type 1 and type 2 depending on the five million factors that influence curly hair. I’m still learning how to care for it. This stuff really brought the life back to my over-moisturized hair though - it had been flat and a bit texture-less, but the volume and waves came back after I used this as a pre-poo treatment and followed the shampoo with my standard conditioner. So I’m gonna say it works. The smell is a little strong, but it hasn’t been a problem for me so far."
529,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s one that works.  I like the curl enhancing smoothie leave-in too,"I have curly gray hair that needs deep conditioning and this is one in my arsenal I will continue to use. The smell is pretty neutral-nothing that will make you use it or not. The effect was evident with the first 15-minute treatment. Softer, curly vs frizzy-even in this humid heat wave we’re having."

I had just went to the beach and the pool with box braids and even with washing and moisturizing with them in, when I took them out my hair was so dry and brittle my scalp felt like it was on 🔥 but when I used this it brought my hair back to the soft and moisturized texture like it was before"

Oh, and my hair is very thick. I bought this because I like the natural ingredients and I heard coconut oil and honey is good for the hair.Well this treatment did nothing for me. It did not help with smoothness and definitely did not help with tangles. My hair felt rough, almost as if I only shampooed my hair.I had to give it away to someone with curlier hair then me."

I found diy (avocado, olive oil, honey) to work great, but after just one try of this, I’m sold. This will become a staple in my hair care routine. Will add it to my diy deep conditioning routine just so that it lasts longer (I have thick and a lot of hair). The only thing I didn’t like was the very strong scent and it is very thick so you need a lot of product."
533,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for everyone. Especially me.,"This stuff gave me protein overload. I learned I have very protein sensitive hair and it did the exact opposite of what I needed.Not for everyone but I will say it smells good. For those who’s hair like butters and thick creams this may be for you. I’ll also add if you do a lot dying and heat processing on your hair this may give you the boost you need. But if not, don’t use it unless you need to."

HUGE disappointment! So much Product was in the packaging bag, you can’t even read the tag. Half of the product missing for such an expensive product. I’m so not happy with this purchase. I will say the product smells great because that’s all I can smell right now.

I have curly hair and I love It and smells very good"

I attempted to get this product into it as per the instructions on the container. It clumped onto my roots and would not spread down the length of my hair. I tried to wet my hair, hoping it would make it easier.. That did not help as well. I then couldn't wash it out. It says to just rinse.. Well, I rinsed for about 5 solid minutes and gave up. I had to shampoo my hair 3 times to remove it and I honestly don't think I got it all out. Definitely not going to use again."

598,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,WHITE FLAKES/BUGS IN CONDITIONER,"I’d like to start by saying that I have purchased this product SEVERAL times from Ulta, Walgreens, CVS, etc. and I have never had it look or feel like this.First red flag— this came UNSEALED!Second red flag— there are white flakes/beads in the conditioner that are not a part of the product (rubbing the conditioner in my hands would not break them down & gently microwaving the conditioner (not in the container obviously, a small portion that I planned to use) wouldn’t even help it mix down. It has to be bugs or something, terrible way to sell a product. Completely unsanitary and not following amazon seller guidelines. I need a refund immediately."
599,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shea Moisture is great! Make sure the formulation is what you need, though!","If you are just starting your curly girl hair journey, study up and determine your hair type- texture, curl level, & porosity level.  With high porosity hair like mine, you usually do not need the level of protein that this conditioner has. HOWEVER, when I color my hair, this is my go-to for at least 2 washes afterward, and also about once a month in the dry indoor Midwest USA winter air. So one jar of this tasts me quite a while- I keep it in the fridge in the summer so it stays fresh. The scent is pleasant and is very mild."

603,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I don't know if this is fake or not  . it had a tag around it saying two pound off next purchase or something like that and had an expiry date on it which was days ago. don't know if that was on the offer or the product. I have most of shea moisture products and love the smell but I smelt this  one and it had a strong alcoholic potent smell to it which made me sick. nothing like all the rest of shea moisture products . is it meant to smell like that? it can't b  still made my hair soft though. but will not buy again just because of alcoholic smell. me no likey.
604,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment, Hair Mask, Deep Conditioner and Hair Treatment, 8 oz",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I heard so much about this mask that maybe I had too high expectations. Did not come sealed -not sure if this is normal or not.... it is indeed a thick product to apply and the smell is lovely. There are no instructions on how to apply it as a prepoo so I used it as a DC. My hair did not feel more moisturised nor stronger .... It felt the same as after other normal deep conditioner. Will definitely try again to see if I get better results ...
