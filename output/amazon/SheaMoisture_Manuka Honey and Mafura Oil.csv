0,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Synthetic fragrance.,"While this is supposed to be free from pretty much everything, it's not free from synthetic fragrance (parfum). This brand I have bought many times before and it was scented with essential oils. It does not disclose this on the website. Disappointed I wasted my time in ordering this. Synthetic fragrances trigger my wife's asthma."
1,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,My original review was awesome,"Why exactly do companies CONSTANTLY have to change products that there is nothing wrong with.  I loved the first bottle it was thick creamy made my course dry thin hair feel amazing.  This last bottle(s) yep like an idiot I ordered 2 of them!!  So upset  I now have dry fuzzy hair again and thick and creamy went right out the window don't put too much of this in your hand or it will run right out and onto the shower floor.  The 1st bottle was amazing no product needed to finish hair after shower just pretty hair.  I never had scalp itch with the 1st bottle now my scalp itches constantly , way to go you saved some money,but you lost at least 1 customer in me.  It doesn't smell,feel or preform the same even my shoulders and back itch after the suds run over them after rinsing.  Do you know how long it took me to find a shampoo that worked this great.  You just don't know how upset I am.  My hair even feels thinner and I swear it is this shampoo.  I am going in search of another brand I can't even tell how much this stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Natural, budget-friendly and hydrating","I have 3B curly hair and used this for about 6 months. In that time, I noticed by hair was well-hydrated and kept good curl definition. I didn't feel like it dried out my hair when I used it every other day. I will say that after 6 mos, my hair grew used to it and no longer felt silky soft after every use, but I still use this to take a break from my other more expensive shampoo.Other things I like about this:- natural, non-harmful ingredients- excellent priceI recommend this for anyone who prefers more natural products and needs to retain as much moisture in their hair as possible"
3,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Two different formulations,I've found that there are two different formulations of this shampoo. One has fragrance (essential oil blend) and the other has fragrance (parfum) which is also higher up on the list (i.e. more of it). I keep having to return the one with parfum--one from Target and this one from Amazon.
4,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Lathers well, smells great, free of most endocrine disrupting chemicals - but one huge concern...","This product lathers well, smells great, and is free of most of the big offenders when it comes to endocrine disrupting chemicals.However, the product I got has ""fragrance (parfum)"" in it.  See the images attached to this review for proof. I had contacted the company in advance because I was concerned about this (per other reviews I saw), and they stated ""The SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo is scented with an Essential oil blend. The product is the same if you purchase it from our website or amazon."" Per their recommendation, I bought this product.But, their statement is just not true. I have to rate this product three stars because the company misled me and their product can contains fragrance (parfum), which is considered an ""undisclosed mixture of various scent chemicals and ingredients that were used as fragrance dispersants ... such as diethyl phthalate""."
5,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and moisturizing,"I bought this shampoo for my dry hair, and I love it! My entire family started using my bottle because it smells so great, so I had to purchase an additional bottle. It has made everyone’s hair feel and smell wonderful! Love that it is free of the bad stuff found in most shampoos. Worth the price for us."
6,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing and long lasting,I would recommend this shampoo for natural hair that is really dry. It leaves my hair really soft and easy to comb. It will last really long because it is thick and doesn't need a lot to work. After one use i was amazed at how little had gone from the bottle. My 2 bottles should last me the whole year
7,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Soft shiny hair, no chemicals to irritate the scalp","I love that it is all natural. So many shampoos today have so many chemicals and they make my head itch or even get a rash. This product doesn't lather well, but as a hairstylist I know, its is still getting my scalp clean and moisturized! Lather doesn't mean clean it's the end result.... and my hair is soft and shiny with no conditioner!love this product"
8,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Suds enough for me!,"This is my second purchase of this product. Although this doesn't suds up like market-bought shampoos, it sudsed quite sufficiently for me and leaves my hair feeling smooth - even before I use a conditioner. I think it actually helps my hair appear less frizzy as well -- a quality I really appreciate."
9,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Real quality,"I would highly recommend this product.  I have color treated hair and have had some issues with dryness and tangling.  After using this shampoo, conditioner and the intensive conditioner my hair is so full and less tangled, I can feel the added moisture too."
10,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!! Please never change!!!,"Good for your hair and you! My daughter got an app which allowed her to check the safety of common products that we use everyday. We were shocked at some of the ingredients in many of the mainstream shampoos and conditioners not to mention a long list of other products. We were in search of moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and decided to try this natural good for you brand. Let me just say WOW!!!! We are all in love with this brand!! It smells amazing, and it restores your hair to a shiny, soft, smooth and healthy texture! I’ve stated recommending it to everyone and buying it for gifts because that’s honestly how much I love it! I just did a huge skin care haul of this brand and made my mom a huge basket full of their products! She going through chemo for the second time and these products being healthy and natural while extremely moisturizing and pampering are absolutely perfect!! I feel great knowing that they’re all exactly what she needs while she can enjoy the luscious formulas and beautiful scents!!Thank you so much for the thoughtful care you put into these products!!"
11,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,"First, I started with the deep conditioner in this line. I was so amazed by how heavy and effective it was that I decided to try to layer every item in my hair, as I run out of my other products.This shampoo is lighter than I was expecting but that's fine. I wash twice (scalp then hair) and it's just as effective as my other shampoo.I'm not sure that its moisturizing effects linger because I layer on a lot of products. But I like using multiple players in the same line. It makes sense that they'd team up to have a greater impact.The scent is heavy - a hint of honey followed by an near-cologne scent. But I got used to it and don't smell it anymore."
12,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Possibly the Best Shampoo I've Ever Used,"I have been using Tresemme products for years.  I decided to try something different as my hair seemed to have lost its body.  I purchased SheaMoisture for two reasons:1.  The price was affordable2.  Description of ingredients and benefits of the productI am in love with SheaMoisture and I don't think I will be going back to Tresemme any time soon, if at all.I only use a tiny bit, less than a dime size, for a full head of lather.  The smell of the shampoo is divine, and lasts all day.  It rinses clean, I don't have to use any conditioner.  And my hair has so much body and fullness, and shines.Will be ordering this repeatedly."
13,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Find another shampoo that works.,This is the worst shampoo I have used. The odor  is very unpleasant but I would deal with it if the product was good. I have to use three to four times the amount of my regular shampoo to wash my hair and my hair feels dry and stiff afterwards. Find another shampoo.
14,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"After trying the ""no poo"" movement for a month (was using Loreal's Cleansing Balm), my hair was dry, frizzy, and frustrating. Wound up in a clip or ponytail every day because I couldn't stand to feel it frizzing all over my face and neck. I finally did some research and found that the ""no poo"" thing just doesn't work for everyone. Hair types, age, hormones, diet, and other factors all play into whether someone can go entirely without shampoo or not. And I can't!I had seen these products before, and heard them recommended by people, so I decided to give it a try. Today was my first use of this shampoo and the conditioner as well. First of all, it smells delicious! The shampoo lathers beautifully. My hair feels soft and healthy, my scalp isn't itching anymore.Win."
15,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as other Shea Moisture products,"Since I have dry hair, I was excited to see what this product could do for me. And it does give really nice curly, smooth pieces of hair.Unfortunately, it also leaves a really serious residue in my hair. This is shampoo; it's supposed to wash out. Instead it sticks to the underlayers of my hair and leaves my scalp looking greasy and unwashed. It's also not really ""moisturized,"" more just... dry with residue. It's brittle and more difficult to brush.I tried more intense rinsing, less shampoo, different application... nothing really made this one work for me. Maybe if you've got 4A-4C hair like they recommend, but I've noticed 4A-4C people on this product mentioning the same problems."
16,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The worse product ever!!!!!,"Made my hair really brittle,dry and knotted up!!!!! I had to pay money for a hair dresser and have my hair cut...... And I had a wedding to be in and had to spend extra money due to this horrid product!!!!!!"
17,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry hair,"I am 70, live in Phoenix, & have an autoimmune condition that causes dry hair, skin, & nails. In other words, I have 3 strikes against me in the dry hair dept. Also, my hair is waist length. I decided to switch shampoo because my hair was getting stinky (like BO) after a couple of days this summer. Because of my autoimmunity, I have to be careful about what personal care products I use. My tolerance for chemicals & scents is affected. The SheaMoisture shampoo & conditioner have been a perfect solution for me. The scents have not bothered me, & my hair is much softer. I still have to use Shea butter on the very ends of my hair, but this combo has made a big improvement in my hair."
18,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product line; this shampoo smells great!,"Smells great AND also has great moisturizing properties. It's quite rich so you actually only need a small amount, pour carefully. It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. I have naturally curly hair which tends to get dry very easily and requires LOTS of products to keep it tamed. I use mostly Shea Moisture products, everything from this shampoo to the mousse, leave-in conditioners, and moisturizing spritzes. I definitely recommend trying this product."
19,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best Moisturizer,"I am going back to Creme of Naure with Honey. If this product moisturizes, then Creme of Nature with honey super moisturizes. I didn't feel this product had intensive hydration. I have a water filter on my showerhead, so I know it isn't the minerals in my water that doesn't make this work. I am back to Creme of Nature. I have the shampoo and conditioner. I will use it on wigs and hairpieces, it works well on them, just not my dry, frizzy, coarse hair."
20,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,pretty decent,"i’ve tried shea moisture before and it just never seemed to work for my 4c hair despite the positive reviews from people with my similar texture. but for some reason this shampoo just hit all the right spots.i used this as a moisturizing shampoo for my locs after i cleansed with trader joe’s tea tree tingle shampoo and it was wonderful. of course it’s not going to give you hydration a shampoo would, but it left my hair feeling a lot less stripped after cleansing.my hair is a big fan of honey so i was happy that my high hopes were met. hopefully this shampoo becomes a regular part of my wash day routine.the scent was a little strong at first, but you get used to if after a while if you aren’t sensitive to smells."
21,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Fantastic Product!!,"Overall, this shampoo has made my hair feeling really moisturized and clean. Something that I stand strongly about this product is that all the ingredients are natural. It makes me feel more secure on what I am using instead of all the chemicals that most brands add to their shampoo's and conditioners.Pros:-Smells very nice, not too strong of a scent.-Keeps my hair moisturized after use-Ingredients are natural-Healthy and shiny looking after useCons:-Doesn't foam (which wasn't a huge issue)-Need a decent amount of shampoo for application"
22,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,hope I can get a refund,"this makes me sad, as I love Minooka honey, but the shampoo is making my scalp itch and burn, and now my scalp is red."
23,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent for low porosity hair,"After completely destroying my hair with protein overload, I needed something that could moisturize my hair without being too heavy on the proteins. This does a way better job over the Curl & Shine line imo, as it is far less likely to weigh down 3b and 3a hair. I just wish this product did a better job at providing that hydration for longer.I'll always keep this around since it does work well, I just need something else to really keep my hair happy because the longer it can maintain moisture after fully drying, the better"
24,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,A pretty good shampoo,"I bought this shampoo to relieve my oily scalp and because it is sulfate free and has more natural ingredients. After use, it definitely made my hair’s oil amount decrease and increased as well as extended the amount of days that my scalp is dry and free of oil. I will say though, this product made my scalp itch a bit but it was nothing too bad. My natural hair is about a 3a to a 3b (wavy/curly but not extremely curly) and this shampoo does a good job cleaning my scalp. I personally like the scent but I will say it is a bit strong, it smells very tart. This scent can easily be covered up with a leave in conditioner or a hair oil that is applied after showering. Overall, I enjoy this product!"
25,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The product actually works on my granddaughter's ethnic hair and her rare beauty.,"The smell of the shampoo is like coconut . . . it reminds you of the tropics.  Callie is 6 years old and is a product of two wonderful races, but we did not know what to do with her hair!  It was a real challenge for us.  So we investigated and SHEA MOISTURE products gets to the ROOT of her hair with the shampoo.  A critical factor.  Now she just has ringlets.  She is amazing and tall and statuesque and BEAUTIFUL!!Woo-woo!  Thank you Amazon and SHEA MOISTURE PRODUCTS."
26,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,An Absolute Disaster for 4C Natural Hair!,"I am so upset that I wasted my money on this shampoo that promises intense hydration and delivered the exact opposite. It completely destroyed my hair follices, creating a very rough texture and thousands of knots. Additionally it smells like a cheap, male cologne. Yuk. I also bought the conditioner in the same line which also further destroyed my hair texture. Wash day disaster! This product must be fake. Do not waste your money."
27,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Helped scalp itch and hair loss,I have used a few times now and it has cut down on my itchy scalp...maybe hair loss (have long hair and am older)  I do not have dandruff but scalp has itched for last 10 years.  Hope this continues to help.
28,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A must buy,"So at first I wasn't too sure about this shampoo &Conditioner, when I was putting it on in the shower it seemed like they were doing much.I have been using this for over a month now and I AM ABSOUTELY IN LOVE with my hair now!! It has never been healthier, softer and as tangle free as it is now using these products! 10/10 reccomend!"
29,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for coarse, dry, or damaged hair",MENS HAIR REVIEW: This product is does a good job cleaning hair without removing too much of the natural oils. I wash with this about 1-2 times a week and condition on the days in between with the coconut/shea butter product from the same brand. I have a very dirty job and it gets everything out with about a tablespoon of product. Gave the scent a 4 only because it doesn’t have much of a scent at all.  Not a big deal since the conditioner I use after has a great scent!!! If you’re looking to go with natural ingredient products this is an affordable option with great results.
30,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and has natural ingredients.,"My wife uses this and just loves it. It is very moisture intensive, so if you have dry hair this may work. I used it on my hair and perhaps I used too much. It made my hair a bit too greasy. It would be great for someone with a dry or itchy scalp, or someone whose hair may be brittle. The ingredients are great, not filled with chemicals and mostly plant based. It smells good too. My wife has used several bottles and continues to enjoy it."
31,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,the softness!!!!!,"Oh man I just used this shampoo along with the deep conditioner, it was a game changer!!! First my hair has unbelievable soft during the washing processing so I thought it wouldn't last once I rinsed it out but I was wrong then the deep conditioner it made detangling a breeze. I have medium short 4B and 4C low porosity"
32,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Moisturizes well, contains no actual honey.","This shampoo is VERY moisturizing. I used it every wash for about a week and now am alternating because it moisturizes a bit too well. I, like others, am confused about the label though. The ingredients list contains no actual Manuka Honey(or any honey for that matter) so it's a bit misleading. Still unsure if it's worth the price."
33,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Was excited but this product sucjs,"A LOT of residue left over on the hair. Never experienced this much left over residue.  Like so much it'll make my hair stiff after using it. Doesnt really fully wash off,  feels slimy on my neck/ ears after using it from the residue, have to use a crap ton just to even attempt to get any oils out. Hair gets greasy immediately. Weighs down your hair, so if you dont have much volume I wouldnt reccomend.  Only good thing about this product is that its sulfate free and doesnt irritate the scalp,  but that doesnt matter when it doesnt actually shampoo your hair. Get a dif product!"
34,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Shampoo,"I love this shampoo.  I find it's got a very nice scent, and it really moisturizes my dry, curly hair.  Reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was poorly packaged and it leaked over the other items I purchased."
35,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like box dye / heavy chemical scent,"I’ve been using the conditioner and conditioning mask in the same scent and decided to order the shampoo as I adore the honey scent.I took a whif of the product while removing the safety seal and it smelt fine, but when I applied it in the shower it had a pungent chemical scent, literally smelt like box dye. Will not repurchase and I do not recommend."
36,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Crunchy Hair,"I tried this and the paired conditioner as a high moisture shampoo/conditioner as a replacement for the Devacurl Decadence line (made my scalp itchy). I have high porosity, 3b/3c curls that need a lot of moisture, so I thought for sure that this ""intensive hydration"" combo would be a good fit. Not the case, unfortunately. After the first use, my hair is crunchy, dry, and rough. Really bummed, but will be looking for other products."
37,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for curly, wavy hair","The scent is heavenly and nothing has made my hair this nice, not even oil treatment, truly magical stuff.  I use the conditioner as well, they're both amazing and very affordable.  I'm a white woman with pretty wavy, curly hair and this stuff does the trick for me without any need for leave ins, I just use a little natural aloe for gel when needed.  Amazing product, please never discontinue!"
38,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,So sad,I heard great things about sheamoisture so I decided to try it out. Unfortunately they changed the ingredients when they sold the company to dove and unilever. They added perfume to the ingredients which is completely overwhelming. Really dislike it will return and not buy anymore of their products going forward. Wish I could have tried them before the change :(
39,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is clean and green,","This has helped so much with my hair growing back, I was panicking because my hair is falling so much with this other shampoo I was using. I soon realized that the fragrance was irritating my scalp and causing scabs and hair to fall out. I found through the dirty app this shampoo it is rated clean and green. Decided to try it out and now I’m in love with this product <3"
40,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Misleading, contains no Manuka honey.","Label says Manuka Honey multiple times in the name, packaging, and description of the product, but once I received the bottle the ingredients list no honey whatsoever. I imagine this is why no ingredients are included on the product listing."
41,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Been using for years.,I have used Shea Moisture shampoos for years. it works fine for me.
42,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best shampoo for curls,"Love this super moisturizing shampoo,  works great on curly hair."
43,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Moisturizing, yes. Scalp does not like the product","The product is definitely a bit moisturizing. I purchased the shampoo and conditioner, and have used them twice. But strangely, my scalp has been itching me since. I re-read the ingredients just to ensure that it was all natural. I cannot seem to put my finger on why this would be happening."
44,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad bottle,"There was no seal on the product, the cap was undone, and the bottle was covered in the sticky residue. I'm not sure if I should use"
45,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as I hoped.,"It's okay but not anything spectacular. The scent is something to get used to, don't get it if you don't like the smell of cedar because this makes your hair smell strong like cedar. It really doesn't seem to make my hair any more soft and it doesn't seem to moisturize it but rather makes me have to wash my hair daily because the second day it's very greesy. Won't but again."
46,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,So soft! Lathers great!,"I love this shampoo. I usually use the moisture retention one but this one lathers, cleanses, and makes my hair sooo soft way better. I like the smell of the moisture retention one better but this one is better in every other aspect for my hair. I have super thick tight curls (type 3c-4a)."
47,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved this product,"Love this shampoo. I have sensitive skin, so I tried this since it doesn’t have a lot of chemicals. Works great! Also, helped a lot with hydration and my hair is now much softer and has more brilliance."
48,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Lose lid equals lost product 😔,Seal was broken from bottle and stuck inside lid. The shampoo had leaked due to lid coming loose. It was all over protective air bags inside box. I knew as soon as I opened the box something smelled great. Wasn't happy to see it was the fact the shampoo had leaked inside the box.

52,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrific, Clinging Odor",Wow. This smells very strongly and I absolutely loathe the smell. It reminds me of cheap men’s cologne and the smell lingers for days. Nothing else about this shampoo matters to me when I am constantly being harangued by a cloud of Hail NO. It goes in the trash
53,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super good for dry hair,"I'm one of those people who can condition my hair 2-3 days in a row without shampooing. We're talking DRY. I have been searching for a moisturizing shampoo for over a year now, and at last! This one has cleaned but not dried it out... and although I'm not using their conditioner yet, I will.  Highly recommend!"
54,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE IT,I LOVE IT!!! I finally found a shampoo that DOESN’T dry my hair out. For a second I thought I was shampoo but y’all.. this is a miracle. Don’t worry I’m a real person and I have 4b hair. I’m gonna definitely try it on my lil sisters hair which is 4c
55,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Shampoo for Healthier manageable Hair!,"Fabulous product, I also purchased the cream rinse and the moisturizer treatment for extra hair care.  My hair dresser asked me after a few weeks of use what I had been doing to my hair ! Her interest was she stated my hair hadn't been this healthy in a year! I put my hair through dying and flat iron, and I  use the Revlon's  roller brush dryer and it was still healthier than ever!"
56,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,great for curly hair.,I have really curly hair that I heat straighten constantly. This is a great shampoo because it keeps my naturally dry hair from becoming dryer. The scent is a subtle gormand.  I definitely recommend.

I wanted something that would condition my scalp as well as my hair, and this does that pretty well.  I still have some itchiness, but I'd say it's better.  I wanted to try the honey -- can't honestly tell if that does anything or not.  Honey is antibacterial, though. So not a bad thing."

I just used it today and can say I have never had my hair softer. It lathers well and I did not use a conditioner afterwards. Report that I had no trouble combing out my fine, dry hair. It smells wonderful and feels great. I probably used too much product, but this was my first try. Four stars so far because I am looking for a rating that reflects use over time. Will update as appropriate."

343,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad reaction to product,Made my scalp extremely dry and flakey. Had to see dermatologist.
344,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,From Desert to Rainforest.,"I had been using a co-wash (I won't name it) that I'd thought to be good. It made my hair look and feel great the day of, and day after washing. However, I began to notice after those two days, my hair and scalp were dry. Sahara desert dry. I'd oil my scalp and the dryness would ensue.I needed a change. I decided, after remembering success with previous She Moisture products, to give this line a try: It changed my life.My hair went from parched to lush. My curls are more defined. My follicles are silky and strengthened. The shine factor is on 100 (People have been asking me if I had my hair dyed).Suffice it to say, this will be my go-to line of hair products. It works for me. The price is right. And it smells amazing."
345,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,Not what i expected
346,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,WORKED AMAZING FOR MY LOW PORISITY HAIR!,I did not buy this on amazon i found it on clearance at walmart and i am so glad i decided to buy it! I chopped all of my hair off 5 months ago after being natural without a big chop for 3 years. My hair has been dry and hard to moisturize ( though its growing well) since. I have low porosity hair. This is literally the first time my hair has felt soft and moisturized  in a very long time! Ive tried many shampooes and this is the first i love!
347,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for me!,"This is a great shampoo for dry, damaged hair.  It makes my hair soft and shiny and it smells like wildflower honey.  It definitely hydrates well and it leaves my hair manageable and soft. My hair is color treated and this shampoo is sulfate free and therefore color safe.  My hair is also very dry from heat styling and this shampoo moisturizes my parched strands nicely.  It's really thick and rich and it lathers well, unlike so many sulfate free formulas.  This is perhaps the most hydrating of all the Shea Moisture shampoos I've tried so it's probably not suitable for fine hair.  I also use the Manuka Honey conditioner, which is also very moisturizing and it has a lot of ""slip"" so detangling is easy.  The combination of these two products give me shiny, soft, hydrated tresses that respond well to my styling efforts.  The shampoo cleanses really well and the conditioner is very nourishing.  I really love them both and they have become holy grail products for me.  I definitely recommend this shampoo (as well as the conditioner) for anyone with dry, color treated hair.  However, you can pick this shampoo and conditioner up at Target or Ulta for $10-$11 apiece, so don't pay outrageous Amazon prices!"
348,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,More Clarifying Than It Is Hydrating...,"This line of Shea Moisture Hair products smells wonderful! And I want to add that I am in love with Shea Moisture as a brand. I have ALL of the products in the ""Strengthen Grow & Restore"" line of SM products but I wanted to venture out to try and find items that focused more on hydration. Thought I'd found it in these, especially with a name like INTESIVE HYDRATION, lol. This shampoo does a GREAT job of cleansing. After washing one time, you'll be able to feel that there's no more dirt in your hair which is not the case with the SG&R line (more about that in a separate review). So that is where the 3 stars come in because this Shampoo does a great job of CLARIFYING my hair. But why it doesn't receive 5 stars is because the hydration is just not ""Intense"" enough...I end up having to use lots of moisturizing products after I've shampooed and conditioned just to combat the severe dryness that is my hair. So in my opinion, it's a great product that tries very hard, but it does not deserve the ""intensive hydration"" title just yet."
349,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This shampoo does clean the hair really good for it to be moisturizing,"With Shea Moisture, knowing one's porosity and current state helps tremendously with selecting the right products. This shampoo does clean the hair really good for it to be moisturizing. I want to be careful with using the term ""clarifying"" because some people may have keratin-treated hair as such as myself and at all costs want to avoid that, ha-ha! However, this product's intentions were meant to hydrate dry and/or damaged hair. It is sulfate free and salt-free so if you do have keratin treated hair, I suggest this shampoo. The ingredients in it also help to heal and fight off scalp issues so this is ideal for me.Overall, this shampoo did leave my hair feeling conditioned. It was extremely prepped for the conditioner. My hair texture is wavy/curly and can easily dry out but it is on the finer side. I can not use the deep conditioner since it's too thick for my hair texture, but the conditioner could be applied to hair and used as a deep conditioner because it's lighter, yet equally hydrating.I want to monitor my hair's use with this product. It does contain hydrolyzed rice protein so if you are on the lower-porosity side, you may want to consider that. My hair is lower-porosity, but I don't mind the extra protein if it tries to clarify the keratin out of my hair, joking! I expect the results to vary for this but if you need hydration and a good cleanse, this would be a top choice since it's sulfate-free."
350,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Burns my scalp,"This product literally burned my scalp to the point of bloody scabs forming. The bottle I have has Fragrance (parfum) as the fourth ingredient, so I'm guessing that's what is irritating my scalp. I have the consitioner and mask from this line and they don't irritate my scalp at all. Very disappointed SM feels the need to add so much fragrance to a shampoo when it's just going to be washed down the drain anyway. I don't recommend trying this product, I have never had a reaction to something like this before."
351,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst shampoo EVER! SO bad.,"I actually like the scent. But the product quality itself.... SO bad. Go into your pantry, pull out a bottle of honey, wet your hair, dump on a bottle of honey, dump on a bottle of lotion. Just try just rinse it out. My hair has never felt so nasty!!! I had to deal for a week until my regular shampoo came in. Guess I'll use this shampoo as hand soap. Really pricey hand soap. There is absolutely nothing else you can use it for. Dont put it near your hair, you'll never be able to rinse out the nastiness. How does this product have any good reviews?! My hand actually got stuck in my hair when it dried after I used this stuff. Could not get a brush thru my hair either. It made me feel so gross."
352,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too sudsy for me,"I have very thick 3B curls and I have not used regular shampoo for over 10 years, I normally just use a cheap conditioner or a low ""poo"" product as a cleansing agent.  I thought I'd give this a try as I really love the intensive conditioner in this same line.  It does say ""no sulfates"" but it is really way too sudsy and shampoo-y for my taste.  I will continue to use the intensive conditioner and use up the rest of this shampoo but go back to using conditioner or the Devacurl Low-poo cleaner which I've always liked."
353,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A god send!,"So far I am loving this. I just started with this product because my brother uses it so I had to purchase my own. Paired perfectly with the corresponding conditioner which I also purchased is a god send to my hair. Other shampoos and conditioners would dry my hair and leave it super tangled, but with this I just washed conditioned, removed excess water and went about my day. Also seems to be helping with frizz which is a big plus."
354,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great For Low Prosity Hair!,"This shampoo, conditioner,  and mask is excellent for low prosity 3c, 4abc hair. Such Amazing lather with the shampoo! Silkness/slickness with conditioner and Mask has Ah-mazing Slip makes your waves and curls soft and pop!! This is a ""definite"" on natural hair gal list!!"
355,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,I have tried many shampoos since going natural 3 years ago and my hair hated most but managed to hang in there,"Finally!  It has happened to me!  A product that my hair loves.  I have tried many shampoos since going natural 3 years ago and my hair hated most but managed to hang in there.  My hair was so dry.  I had to apply products every day to keep it moisturizer.  Now I use Shea Hydrating and I don't have to use products every day.  I wash my hair with the shampoo, add lotion, greas, (yeah the Dax is still my go to y'all) and Black Castor Oil Lotion(this stuff is ahmazing!) and my hair loves it.  I can go out in the rain, humidity, etc. without my hair shrinking into a hard dry mess.  I must add that trimming your hair is a must.  I needed a serious trim and after that, my hair rocks.  Finally!  I love my natural hair and it feels so soft and luscious!  I just wished they made a bigger bottle but a little product goes a long way.  I would like a bigger bottle tho, just saying."
356,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,has Manuka Honey ingredient which is a healing agent. Good stuff,I love it. very nice and healing to my scalp and moisturizes my long natural curls. However the last shipment I received the safety seal was off and inside the cap and the bottle leaked a little in shipment. I was disappointed and my next purchase will be in the store so I can make sure the safety seal is on.
357,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Scent Is Too Strong, Irritates Scalp","It does its job as a shampoo. I love the smell. HOWEVER, the smell is too strong. Any heavy perfumes added to hair products irritates my scalp, just like this one did. It made my scalp dry,  scabby and scaly. I cant do this anymore. In the trash it goes."

359,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"Thought i finally found a shampoo and conditioner for my low porosity hair, after the first use my hair came out soft BUT fuzzy and lost curl definition. Im disappointed. Will this situation improve with continued use?"
360,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great shampoo,"Love this shampoo, I've been using it for years, but I think this recent one had a manufacturing defect. It poured out like water when usually it is really thick. It seemed like it was 30% shampoo and 70% water, so much so it poured off my hand so it was hard to try to use it, I had to use half the bottle for one shampoo. I am still giving it a 4 because I really believe there was just something wrong with this one."
361,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silk Making Magic,"My hair had a dryness with a thirst no moisturizer could quench until I started using this shampoo.  Since I have never been happy with sulfate-free shampoos, I had low expectations for this one. This shampoo lathers and cleanses well. My hair is soft from the time I rinse the shampoo out until the next time I wash my hair. The shampoo has a very pleasant smell and a little goes a long way. I can't imagine going back to any other shampoo."
362,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing shampoo- not very good at cleaning,The scent is wonderful. The shampoo is very gentle and does not clean as well as I thought it would. A quarter-sized amount or more of the shampoo is required even for short hair.

I am able to start the detangling process right after a wash which is a first for me. As in, running my fingers through thick, 4c hair! The scent is yummy and the moisture is nice. I would recommend this for those with dry hair. I purchased mine through Ulta and not Amazon. Ulta always has coupon available so that helps in not being concerned with money lost when trying a new product.

370,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to work great for 4c hair in a protective style,I wash my hair once a week/ 10 days and because this has protein I use this and the conditioner as my protein wash every other week (I use the SM Black Soap purification masque and balancing conditioner as my protein free moisture wash in between)My hair is currently in twists but they seem to clean the scalp well and left my scalp just as soft and moisturized as the Black soap range- which I love!The real test will be washing my hair once out of a protective style.The Manuka Honey range has a much better smell than the the other SM ranges too.
371,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm glad I got to try this shampoo because it is ...,I was hesitant to try any more SheaMoisture products after not liking the Raw Shea butter line. I'm glad I got to try this shampoo because it is alot different than the raw shea one. This one has a nice rich moisturizing lather and cleans well even with oils in my hair. It leaves hair really soft and almost don't need a conditioner after. Nothing like the greasy/dried out feeling of the Raw shea line.

Yes, it smells nice but it left my hair feeling terrible. It felt brittle, greasy and clumpy. I hated this product, and wish I could return it. Also, $17 is entirely too much to pay for this. It is $10 at Target. Don't be duped."

I’m usually not one to go out of my way to write a negative review, I just personally really didn’t like this shampoo at all. It was very oily and it smells awful. This really is a preference thing, but it ruined it for me. It leaves an oily residue on your hands after you wash your hair. I was just not a fan."

I read a few places this is one of the best shampoos for your hair because of the ingredients so I gave it a try. Unfortunately, it left a thick residue on my roots, and it made my hair a bit ratty feeling. The day after, I had to wash with dandruff shampoo to get all the residue out. I'm going to give it another try because I really want to love this shampoo. It might actually be too moisturizing! :\"

402,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does exactly what it is supposed to!!,"The whole Manukau honey set (the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner) did WONDERS for my hair! I saw this method on TikTok where you condition your hair first, shampoo, and then deep condition (I’ll abbreviate it as the C/S/DC method 😜) and BABY let me tell you… my hair has never felt softer and more moisturized! I was a little skeptical at first but now I HIGHLY recommend it if you have dry, low porosity, brittle hair that breaks easily! I used to have TERRIBLE breakage! I mean like losing 3-5 HANDFULS of hair no matter WHAT I did! I’ve tried several different shampoos, conditioners, and deep conditioners… many different oils, I’ve tried finger detangling… I get regular trims from a licensed hairstylist but NOTHING would help with the breakage but baby… doing the C/S/DC method with these products has reduced my breakage GREATLY! In the pic is the amount of hair I’ve lost from START to FINISH!!! Just a palm full!!! My hair has never felt softer and so moisturized and hydrated!!!! I cannot believe that method with these products reduced my hair breakage that much!!!!!!! I’m sure you can do the C/S/DC method with any products from any company but if you’re someone like me that has super dry, brittle hair with low porosity and breaks off easily I’d recommend these from Shea Moisture!! And the manukau honey set smells AMAZING too and the scent lasts which is a plus!!! I’m super excited now I feel like my hair is really going to start growing and getting stronger now I’ll be sure to update if anything changes !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

411,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Bought this shampoo as recommended by the Curly Girl method - I really like it. Been using it about 3 weeks now and my hair feels in much better condition probably due to the lack of chemicals in this one (it's all natural stuff).  Lathers up nicely and rinses well.  I use with the Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner and they partner very well.  Did wash my hair in my old brand as a comparison and hair felt noticeably drier but on reverting to this again, the shine came straight back. Highly recommend if you want to calm frizz and have nice bouncy curls!"

PEROOOOO cuando el pelo se seca es otra cosaaa, como el champú tiene aceites como base, el cuero cabelludo queda super grasoso, Tal vez esto no le pase a las chavas con poquito pelo, yo tengo un PELUCON, son como 3 cabezas en 1, la primera vez pensé que tal vez no me había tallado bien, la segunda me aseguré de hacerlo por secciones y que el producto llegara hasta la raíz e hiciera su espumita y todo...y cuando lo sequé con secadora, Dios mio, eran como gajos de pelo de lo aceitoso que estaba mi cuero cabelludo."

Once I tried this, I never want to go back to those heavy chemical popular shampoo brands in the stores anymore. This Manuka Honey Shampoo has a great smell and it leaves moisture on my hair after wash. Hair feels much better and naturally glossier - but not oily. The popular shampoo brands often get my hair dirty and oily after a day and I have to wash hair everyday or else it is too oily - even on days I didn’t go out of the house or didn’t do much activities to be sweaty or dirty. Hence, I only use this product for me and my partner from now on."

525,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"I have to say I'm pretty impressed. I've not had any luck trying Shea Moisture products in the last two years. I've tried various, especially from the famed Coconut and Hibiscus line and hated every single one of them due to their sickly stench and the amount I had to use to look just barely presentable. My hair was made frizzy so I gave them away to my mum who also hated them and threw them away. I was very put off trying Shea Moisture again but seeing so many new product lines and their introduction to stores near me, which otherwise neglect curly hair products, made me want to try once more.This was a pleasant surprise. It smells perfumed and slightly earthy. When wet it smells like macadamia nuts, which I like, so it made me rather pleased. The first time I used it, I had to prepare myself to throw it away because it instantly made my strands stick together as it lathered up so fiercely. But after washing it out fully, my hair felt fine. Not super moisturised like the product claims, honestly, but the way I've always expected from a gentle shampoo. My hair doesn't feel stripped, but just before that stage at super clean. My scalp isn't irritated, I'm guessing that's due to the lack of hard sulfates as I can no longer use regular shampoos that make my scalp burn and itch.I'm still questioning whether I should get it again because As I Am's Coconut Cowash is super moisturising and cleansing at the same time. And I really have a lot of hair and want to keep my wash routine to as minimal steps as possible and the cowash lets me get away with not needing to shampoo and then condition. We'll see, but so far the cowash is winning out as it is also the cheaper of the two for a bigger volume of product. So, if the shampoo were cheaper, I might just designate it my new default cleanser. That being said, I love the packaging and my success with this product has encouraged me to not completely give up hope buying Shea Moisture products in the future.Now if only a wider variety was available' on Amazon...Edit: After much deliberation, I've decided to go back to my cowash. It's cheaper and all of the scabs and itchiness that I used to deal with daily from my sulfate conditioners have returned with this shampoo. It is NOT SULFATE FREE. I do feel lied to, I look on the ingredients, while it has only softer sulfates in it, they're still sulfates. I decided to continue using it because I wanted to give the product a chance but now my scalp is suffering and my hair has become extremely dry over time (this being the only new product to be incorporated into my regular routine) to the point where I have had to cut my hair. I found that many companies are now labelling their products as sulfate free and are not, so be careful."
526,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,It helps the hair by not removing all hydration. I am satisfied.
527,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Ich liebe die Produkte von shea moistur. Nicht alle Produkte sind für mein glattes Haar geeignet aber diese Feuchtigkeitspflege ist perfekt. Die Reihe versorgt ausgiebig mit Feuchtigkeit ohne das Haar zu beschweren.

Ein Traum, absolute Kaufempfehlung auch für glattes Haar :)"
528,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"My menopausal hair has suffered greatly recently. I have tried endless shampoos from expensive to cheap with no success, the dryness and the frizz looked set to stay until I found manuka honey. I was sceptical but the lather is thick and creamy and as I rinsed I could instantly feel a difference in my hair. It's not the cheapest shampoo but it's worth every penny, the scent isnt coco chanel but it's pleasant and who cares anyway when you finally have soft shiny hair again. This shampoo will suit everyone but to ladies of a certain age I say GO FOR IT you won't regret it"
529,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"This changed my hair from the first use.

535,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Bis jetzt - das beste Shampoo, das ich je hatte und auch mein Lieblingsshampoo geworden! Ich hatte viele Produkte von SM für Haare ausprobiert, u.a. auch Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo lange Zeit benutzt, aber dieses Shampoo gefällt mir viiiiiel besser! Es schäumt überhaupt nicht und fühlt sich an den Haaren eher wie ein Conditioner an, auch nach der Haarwäsche habe ich immer so ein Gefühl, als ob meine Haare keine Spülung mehr brauchen. Ich benutze trotzdem immer eine von SM. Also die Haare fühlen sich nicht ausgetrocknet und genährt - perfekt für meine normalerweise sehr trockene und strapazierte Locken. Auch der Geruch des Shampoos ist m.M.n. sehr angenehm und nicht aufdringlich. Es reinigt die Haare und Kopfhaut sehr gut, obwohl es schäumt überhaupt nicht. Also ich bin super zufrieden!"

Kann ich nur empfehlen!"

Nun teste ich dieses Shampoo 1 Monat und muss leider feststellen, dass meine Haare sich zwar während des Waschens gut anfühlen. Jedoch wenn diese getrocknet sind bekomme ich schuppige Kopfhaut und die Haare fühlen sich am Ansatz super fettig (meine Haarbürste ist voll damit) und an den Enden wie Stroh an. Der Duft ist sehr aufdringlich, man kann sich aber dran gewöhnen (wenn man gerne riecht wie eine gute Parfümflasche dann ist das wohl das richtige Shampoo). Meine Naturlocken haben sich übrigens verringert. Ich würde es nicht wieder kaufen."

It lathers up just like other sulphate shampoos, convincing me this is NOT sulphate free. I knew something was wrong when I poured it out of my latest bottle - the consistency and colour were different. Then it lathered up on use. Sulphate free shampoos do not lather! The ingredient list has changed. They’ve now started using fake fragrance (aka Parfum) instead of natural fragrance sources. The ingredients they list as not being included has drastically reduced (i.e., the bad stuff in the shampoo is increasing). It’s a shame that a brand like theirs is trying to cut corners to make a quick buck at the cost of giving customers a truly good, natural product. Don’t expect the same shampoo if you’ve been a regular user like me!"

1,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,My original review was awesome,"Why exactly do companies CONSTANTLY have to change products that there is nothing wrong with.  I loved the first bottle it was thick creamy made my course dry thin hair feel amazing.  This last bottle(s) yep like an idiot I ordered 2 of them!!  So upset  I now have dry fuzzy hair again and thick and creamy went right out the window don't put too much of this in your hand or it will run right out and onto the shower floor.  The 1st bottle was amazing no product needed to finish hair after shower just pretty hair.  I never had scalp itch with the 1st bottle now my scalp itches constantly , way to go you saved some money,but you lost at least 1 customer in me.  It doesn't smell,feel or preform the same even my shoulders and back itch after the suds run over them after rinsing.  Do you know how long it took me to find a shampoo that worked this great.  You just don't know how upset I am.  My hair even feels thinner and I swear it is this shampoo.  I am going in search of another brand I can't even tell how much this stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Natural, budget-friendly and hydrating","I have 3B curly hair and used this for about 6 months. In that time, I noticed by hair was well-hydrated and kept good curl definition. I didn't feel like it dried out my hair when I used it every other day. I will say that after 6 mos, my hair grew used to it and no longer felt silky soft after every use, but I still use this to take a break from my other more expensive shampoo.Other things I like about this:- natural, non-harmful ingredients- excellent priceI recommend this for anyone who prefers more natural products and needs to retain as much moisture in their hair as possible"
3,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Two different formulations,I've found that there are two different formulations of this shampoo. One has fragrance (essential oil blend) and the other has fragrance (parfum) which is also higher up on the list (i.e. more of it). I keep having to return the one with parfum--one from Target and this one from Amazon.
4,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Lathers well, smells great, free of most endocrine disrupting chemicals - but one huge concern...","This product lathers well, smells great, and is free of most of the big offenders when it comes to endocrine disrupting chemicals.However, the product I got has ""fragrance (parfum)"" in it.  See the images attached to this review for proof. I had contacted the company in advance because I was concerned about this (per other reviews I saw), and they stated ""The SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo is scented with an Essential oil blend. The product is the same if you purchase it from our website or amazon."" Per their recommendation, I bought this product.But, their statement is just not true. I have to rate this product three stars because the company misled me and their product can contains fragrance (parfum), which is considered an ""undisclosed mixture of various scent chemicals and ingredients that were used as fragrance dispersants ... such as diethyl phthalate""."

My entire family started using my bottle because it smells so great, so I had to purchase an additional bottle. It has made everyone’s hair feel and smell wonderful! Love that it is free of the bad stuff found in most shampoos. Worth the price for us."
6,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing and long lasting,I would recommend this shampoo for natural hair that is really dry. It leaves my hair really soft and easy to comb. It will last really long because it is thick and doesn't need a lot to work. After one use i was amazed at how little had gone from the bottle. My 2 bottles should last me the whole year

So many shampoos today have so many chemicals and they make my head itch or even get a rash. This product doesn't lather well, but as a hairstylist I know, its is still getting my scalp clean and moisturized! Lather doesn't mean clean it's the end result.... and my hair is soft and shiny with no conditioner!love this product"
8,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Suds enough for me!,"This is my second purchase of this product. Although this doesn't suds up like market-bought shampoos, it sudsed quite sufficiently for me and leaves my hair feeling smooth - even before I use a conditioner. I think it actually helps my hair appear less frizzy as well -- a quality I really appreciate."
9,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Real quality,"I would highly recommend this product.  I have color treated hair and have had some issues with dryness and tangling.  After using this shampoo, conditioner and the intensive conditioner my hair is so full and less tangled, I can feel the added moisture too."
10,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!! Please never change!!!,"Good for your hair and you! My daughter got an app which allowed her to check the safety of common products that we use everyday. We were shocked at some of the ingredients in many of the mainstream shampoos and conditioners not to mention a long list of other products. We were in search of moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and decided to try this natural good for you brand. Let me just say WOW!!!! We are all in love with this brand!! It smells amazing, and it restores your hair to a shiny, soft, smooth and healthy texture! I’ve stated recommending it to everyone and buying it for gifts because that’s honestly how much I love it! I just did a huge skin care haul of this brand and made my mom a huge basket full of their products! She going through chemo for the second time and these products being healthy and natural while extremely moisturizing and pampering are absolutely perfect!! I feel great knowing that they’re all exactly what she needs while she can enjoy the luscious formulas and beautiful scents!!Thank you so much for the thoughtful care you put into these products!!"
11,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,"First, I started with the deep conditioner in this line. I was so amazed by how heavy and effective it was that I decided to try to layer every item in my hair, as I run out of my other products.This shampoo is lighter than I was expecting but that's fine. I wash twice (scalp then hair) and it's just as effective as my other shampoo.I'm not sure that its moisturizing effects linger because I layer on a lot of products. But I like using multiple players in the same line. It makes sense that they'd team up to have a greater impact.The scent is heavy - a hint of honey followed by an near-cologne scent. But I got used to it and don't smell it anymore."
12,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Possibly the Best Shampoo I've Ever Used,"I have been using Tresemme products for years.  I decided to try something different as my hair seemed to have lost its body.  I purchased SheaMoisture for two reasons:1.  The price was affordable2.  Description of ingredients and benefits of the productI am in love with SheaMoisture and I don't think I will be going back to Tresemme any time soon, if at all.I only use a tiny bit, less than a dime size, for a full head of lather.  The smell of the shampoo is divine, and lasts all day.  It rinses clean, I don't have to use any conditioner.  And my hair has so much body and fullness, and shines.Will be ordering this repeatedly."
13,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Find another shampoo that works.,This is the worst shampoo I have used. The odor  is very unpleasant but I would deal with it if the product was good. I have to use three to four times the amount of my regular shampoo to wash my hair and my hair feels dry and stiff afterwards. Find another shampoo.
14,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"After trying the ""no poo"" movement for a month (was using Loreal's Cleansing Balm), my hair was dry, frizzy, and frustrating. Wound up in a clip or ponytail every day because I couldn't stand to feel it frizzing all over my face and neck. I finally did some research and found that the ""no poo"" thing just doesn't work for everyone. Hair types, age, hormones, diet, and other factors all play into whether someone can go entirely without shampoo or not. And I can't!I had seen these products before, and heard them recommended by people, so I decided to give it a try. Today was my first use of this shampoo and the conditioner as well. First of all, it smells delicious! The shampoo lathers beautifully. My hair feels soft and healthy, my scalp isn't itching anymore.Win."
15,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as other Shea Moisture products,"Since I have dry hair, I was excited to see what this product could do for me. And it does give really nice curly, smooth pieces of hair.Unfortunately, it also leaves a really serious residue in my hair. This is shampoo; it's supposed to wash out. Instead it sticks to the underlayers of my hair and leaves my scalp looking greasy and unwashed. It's also not really ""moisturized,"" more just... dry with residue. It's brittle and more difficult to brush.I tried more intense rinsing, less shampoo, different application... nothing really made this one work for me. Maybe if you've got 4A-4C hair like they recommend, but I've noticed 4A-4C people on this product mentioning the same problems."
16,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The worse product ever!!!!!,"Made my hair really brittle,dry and knotted up!!!!! I had to pay money for a hair dresser and have my hair cut...... And I had a wedding to be in and had to spend extra money due to this horrid product!!!!!!"
17,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry hair,"I am 70, live in Phoenix, & have an autoimmune condition that causes dry hair, skin, & nails. In other words, I have 3 strikes against me in the dry hair dept. Also, my hair is waist length. I decided to switch shampoo because my hair was getting stinky (like BO) after a couple of days this summer. Because of my autoimmunity, I have to be careful about what personal care products I use. My tolerance for chemicals & scents is affected. The SheaMoisture shampoo & conditioner have been a perfect solution for me. The scents have not bothered me, & my hair is much softer. I still have to use Shea butter on the very ends of my hair, but this combo has made a big improvement in my hair."
18,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product line; this shampoo smells great!,"Smells great AND also has great moisturizing properties. It's quite rich so you actually only need a small amount, pour carefully. It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean. I have naturally curly hair which tends to get dry very easily and requires LOTS of products to keep it tamed. I use mostly Shea Moisture products, everything from this shampoo to the mousse, leave-in conditioners, and moisturizing spritzes. I definitely recommend trying this product."
19,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best Moisturizer,"I am going back to Creme of Naure with Honey. If this product moisturizes, then Creme of Nature with honey super moisturizes. I didn't feel this product had intensive hydration. I have a water filter on my showerhead, so I know it isn't the minerals in my water that doesn't make this work. I am back to Creme of Nature. I have the shampoo and conditioner. I will use it on wigs and hairpieces, it works well on them, just not my dry, frizzy, coarse hair."
20,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,pretty decent,"i’ve tried shea moisture before and it just never seemed to work for my 4c hair despite the positive reviews from people with my similar texture. but for some reason this shampoo just hit all the right spots.i used this as a moisturizing shampoo for my locs after i cleansed with trader joe’s tea tree tingle shampoo and it was wonderful. of course it’s not going to give you hydration a shampoo would, but it left my hair feeling a lot less stripped after cleansing.my hair is a big fan of honey so i was happy that my high hopes were met. hopefully this shampoo becomes a regular part of my wash day routine.the scent was a little strong at first, but you get used to if after a while if you aren’t sensitive to smells."
21,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Fantastic Product!!,"Overall, this shampoo has made my hair feeling really moisturized and clean. Something that I stand strongly about this product is that all the ingredients are natural. It makes me feel more secure on what I am using instead of all the chemicals that most brands add to their shampoo's and conditioners.Pros:-Smells very nice, not too strong of a scent.-Keeps my hair moisturized after use-Ingredients are natural-Healthy and shiny looking after useCons:-Doesn't foam (which wasn't a huge issue)-Need a decent amount of shampoo for application"
22,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,hope I can get a refund,"this makes me sad, as I love Minooka honey, but the shampoo is making my scalp itch and burn, and now my scalp is red."
23,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent for low porosity hair,"After completely destroying my hair with protein overload, I needed something that could moisturize my hair without being too heavy on the proteins. This does a way better job over the Curl & Shine line imo, as it is far less likely to weigh down 3b and 3a hair. I just wish this product did a better job at providing that hydration for longer.I'll always keep this around since it does work well, I just need something else to really keep my hair happy because the longer it can maintain moisture after fully drying, the better"
24,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,A pretty good shampoo,"I bought this shampoo to relieve my oily scalp and because it is sulfate free and has more natural ingredients. After use, it definitely made my hair’s oil amount decrease and increased as well as extended the amount of days that my scalp is dry and free of oil. I will say though, this product made my scalp itch a bit but it was nothing too bad. My natural hair is about a 3a to a 3b (wavy/curly but not extremely curly) and this shampoo does a good job cleaning my scalp. I personally like the scent but I will say it is a bit strong, it smells very tart. This scent can easily be covered up with a leave in conditioner or a hair oil that is applied after showering. Overall, I enjoy this product!"
25,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The product actually works on my granddaughter's ethnic hair and her rare beauty.,"The smell of the shampoo is like coconut . . . it reminds you of the tropics.  Callie is 6 years old and is a product of two wonderful races, but we did not know what to do with her hair!  It was a real challenge for us.  So we investigated and SHEA MOISTURE products gets to the ROOT of her hair with the shampoo.  A critical factor.  Now she just has ringlets.  She is amazing and tall and statuesque and BEAUTIFUL!!Woo-woo!  Thank you Amazon and SHEA MOISTURE PRODUCTS."
26,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,An Absolute Disaster for 4C Natural Hair!,"I am so upset that I wasted my money on this shampoo that promises intense hydration and delivered the exact opposite. It completely destroyed my hair follices, creating a very rough texture and thousands of knots. Additionally it smells like a cheap, male cologne. Yuk. I also bought the conditioner in the same line which also further destroyed my hair texture. Wash day disaster! This product must be fake. Do not waste your money."
27,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Helped scalp itch and hair loss,I have used a few times now and it has cut down on my itchy scalp...maybe hair loss (have long hair and am older)  I do not have dandruff but scalp has itched for last 10 years.

It has never been healthier, softer and as tangle free as it is now using these products! 10/10 reccomend!"
29,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for coarse, dry, or damaged hair",MENS HAIR REVIEW: This product is does a good job cleaning hair without removing too much of the natural oils. I wash with this about 1-2 times a week and condition on the days in between with the coconut/shea butter product from the same brand. I have a very dirty job and it gets everything out with about a tablespoon of product. Gave the scent a 4 only because it doesn’t have much of a scent at all.  Not a big deal since the conditioner I use after has a great scent!!! If you’re looking to go with natural ingredient products this is an affordable option with great results.
30,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and has natural ingredients.,"My wife uses this and just loves it. It is very moisture intensive, so if you have dry hair this may work. I used it on my hair and perhaps I used too much. It made my hair a bit too greasy. It would be great for someone with a dry or itchy scalp, or someone whose hair may be brittle. The ingredients are great, not filled with chemicals and mostly plant based. It smells good too. My wife has used several bottles and continues to enjoy it."
31,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,the softness!!!!!,"Oh man I just used this shampoo along with the deep conditioner, it was a game changer!!! First my hair has unbelievable soft during the washing processing so I thought it wouldn't last once I rinsed it out but I was wrong then the deep conditioner it made detangling a breeze. I have medium short 4B and 4C low porosity"
32,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Moisturizes well, contains no actual honey.","This shampoo is VERY moisturizing. I used it every wash for about a week and now am alternating because it moisturizes a bit too well. I, like others, am confused about the label though. The ingredients list contains no actual Manuka Honey(or any honey for that matter) so it's a bit misleading. Still unsure if it's worth the price."
33,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Was excited but this product sucjs,"A LOT of residue left over on the hair. Never experienced this much left over residue.  Like so much it'll make my hair stiff after using it. Doesnt really fully wash off,  feels slimy on my neck/ ears after using it from the residue, have to use a crap ton just to even attempt to get any oils out. Hair gets greasy immediately. Weighs down your hair, so if you dont have much volume I wouldnt reccomend.  Only good thing about this product is that its sulfate free and doesnt irritate the scalp,  but that doesnt matter when it doesnt actually shampoo your hair. Get a dif product!"
34,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Shampoo,"I love this shampoo.  I find it's got a very nice scent, and it really moisturizes my dry, curly hair.  Reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was poorly packaged and it leaked over the other items I purchased."
35,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like box dye / heavy chemical scent,"I’ve been using the conditioner and conditioning mask in the same scent and decided to order the shampoo as I adore the honey scent.I took a whif of the product while removing the safety seal and it smelt fine, but when I applied it in the shower it had a pungent chemical scent, literally smelt like box dye. Will not repurchase and I do not recommend."
36,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Crunchy Hair,"I tried this and the paired conditioner as a high moisture shampoo/conditioner as a replacement for the Devacurl Decadence line (made my scalp itchy). I have high porosity, 3b/3c curls that need a lot of moisture, so I thought for sure that this ""intensive hydration"" combo would be a good fit. Not the case, unfortunately. After the first use, my hair is crunchy, dry, and rough. Really bummed, but will be looking for other products."
37,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for curly, wavy hair","The scent is heavenly and nothing has made my hair this nice, not even oil treatment, truly magical stuff.  I use the conditioner as well, they're both amazing and very affordable.  I'm a white woman with pretty wavy, curly hair and this stuff does the trick for me without any need for leave ins, I just use a little natural aloe for gel when needed.  Amazing product, please never discontinue!"
38,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,So sad,I heard great things about sheamoisture so I decided to try it out. Unfortunately they changed the ingredients when they sold the company to dove and unilever. They added perfume to the ingredients which is completely overwhelming. Really dislike it will return and not buy anymore of their products going forward. Wish I could have tried them before the change :(

I soon realized that the fragrance was irritating my scalp and causing scabs and hair to fall out. I found through the dirty app this shampoo it is rated clean and green. Decided to try it out and now I’m in love with this product <3"
40,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Misleading, contains no Manuka honey.","Label says Manuka Honey multiple times in the name, packaging, and description of the product, but once I received the bottle the ingredients list no honey whatsoever.

45,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as I hoped.,"It's okay but not anything spectacular. The scent is something to get used to, don't get it if you don't like the smell of cedar because this makes your hair smell strong like cedar. It really doesn't seem to make my hair any more soft and it doesn't seem to moisturize it but rather makes me have to wash my hair daily because the second day it's very greesy. Won't but again."

I wanted something that would condition my scalp as well as my hair, and this does that pretty well.  I still have some itchiness, but I'd say it's better.  I wanted to try the honey -- can't honestly tell if that does anything or not.  Honey is antibacterial, though. So not a bad thing."

I just used it today and can say I have never had my hair softer. It lathers well and I did not use a conditioner afterwards. Report that I had no trouble combing out my fine, dry hair. It smells wonderful and feels great. I probably used too much product, but this was my first try. Four stars so far because I am looking for a rating that reflects use over time.

343,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad reaction to product,Made my scalp extremely dry and flakey. Had to see dermatologist.
344,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,From Desert to Rainforest.,"I had been using a co-wash (I won't name it) that I'd thought to be good. It made my hair look and feel great the day of, and day after washing. However, I began to notice after those two days, my hair and scalp were dry. Sahara desert dry. I'd oil my scalp and the dryness would ensue.I needed a change. I decided, after remembering success with previous She Moisture products, to give this line a try: It changed my life.My hair went from parched to lush. My curls are more defined. My follicles are silky and strengthened. The shine factor is on 100 (People have been asking me if I had my hair dyed).Suffice it to say, this will be my go-to line of hair products. It works for me. The price is right. And it smells amazing."
345,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,Not what i expected
346,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,WORKED AMAZING FOR MY LOW PORISITY HAIR!,I did not buy this on amazon i found it on clearance at walmart and i am so glad i decided to buy it! I chopped all of my hair off 5 months ago after being natural without a big chop for 3 years. My hair has been dry and hard to moisturize ( though its growing well) since. I have low porosity hair. This is literally the first time my hair has felt soft and moisturized  in a very long time! Ive tried many shampooes and this is the first i love!
347,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for me!,"This is a great shampoo for dry, damaged hair.  It makes my hair soft and shiny and it smells like wildflower honey.  It definitely hydrates well and it leaves my hair manageable and soft. My hair is color treated and this shampoo is sulfate free and therefore color safe.  My hair is also very dry from heat styling and this shampoo moisturizes my parched strands nicely.  It's really thick and rich and it lathers well, unlike so many sulfate free formulas.  This is perhaps the most hydrating of all the Shea Moisture shampoos I've tried so it's probably not suitable for fine hair.  I also use the Manuka Honey conditioner, which is also very moisturizing and it has a lot of ""slip"" so detangling is easy.  The combination of these two products give me shiny, soft, hydrated tresses that respond well to my styling efforts.  The shampoo cleanses really well and the conditioner is very nourishing.  I really love them both and they have become holy grail products for me.  I definitely recommend this shampoo (as well as the conditioner) for anyone with dry, color treated hair.  However, you can pick this shampoo and conditioner up at Target or Ulta for $10-$11 apiece, so don't pay outrageous Amazon prices!"
348,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,More Clarifying Than It Is Hydrating...,"This line of Shea Moisture Hair products smells wonderful! And I want to add that I am in love with Shea Moisture as a brand. I have ALL of the products in the ""Strengthen Grow & Restore"" line of SM products but I wanted to venture out to try and find items that focused more on hydration. Thought I'd found it in these, especially with a name like INTESIVE HYDRATION, lol. This shampoo does a GREAT job of cleansing. After washing one time, you'll be able to feel that there's no more dirt in your hair which is not the case with the SG&R line (more about that in a separate review). So that is where the 3 stars come in because this Shampoo does a great job of CLARIFYING my hair. But why it doesn't receive 5 stars is because the hydration is just not ""Intense"" enough...I end up having to use lots of moisturizing products after I've shampooed and conditioned just to combat the severe dryness that is my hair. So in my opinion, it's a great product that tries very hard, but it does not deserve the ""intensive hydration"" title just yet."
349,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This shampoo does clean the hair really good for it to be moisturizing,"With Shea Moisture, knowing one's porosity and current state helps tremendously with selecting the right products. This shampoo does clean the hair really good for it to be moisturizing. I want to be careful with using the term ""clarifying"" because some people may have keratin-treated hair as such as myself and at all costs want to avoid that, ha-ha! However, this product's intentions were meant to hydrate dry and/or damaged hair. It is sulfate free and salt-free so if you do have keratin treated hair, I suggest this shampoo. The ingredients in it also help to heal and fight off scalp issues so this is ideal for me.Overall, this shampoo did leave my hair feeling conditioned. It was extremely prepped for the conditioner. My hair texture is wavy/curly and can easily dry out but it is on the finer side. I can not use the deep conditioner since it's too thick for my hair texture, but the conditioner could be applied to hair and used as a deep conditioner because it's lighter, yet equally hydrating.I want to monitor my hair's use with this product. It does contain hydrolyzed rice protein so if you are on the lower-porosity side, you may want to consider that. My hair is lower-porosity, but I don't mind the extra protein if it tries to clarify the keratin out of my hair, joking! I expect the results to vary for this but if you need hydration and a good cleanse, this would be a top choice since it's sulfate-free."
350,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Burns my scalp,"This product literally burned my scalp to the point of bloody scabs forming. The bottle I have has Fragrance (parfum) as the fourth ingredient, so I'm guessing that's what is irritating my scalp. I have the consitioner and mask from this line and they don't irritate my scalp at all. Very disappointed SM feels the need to add so much fragrance to a shampoo when it's just going to be washed down the drain anyway. I don't recommend trying this product, I have never had a reaction to something like this before."
351,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst shampoo EVER! SO bad.,"I actually like the scent. But the product quality itself.... SO bad. Go into your pantry, pull out a bottle of honey, wet your hair, dump on a bottle of honey, dump on a bottle of lotion. Just try just rinse it out. My hair has never felt so nasty!!! I had to deal for a week until my regular shampoo came in. Guess I'll use this shampoo as hand soap. Really pricey hand soap. There is absolutely nothing else you can use it for. Dont put it near your hair, you'll never be able to rinse out the nastiness. How does this product have any good reviews?! My hand actually got stuck in my hair when it dried after I used this stuff. Could not get a brush thru my hair either. It made me feel so gross."
352,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too sudsy for me,"I have very thick 3B curls and I have not used regular shampoo for over 10 years, I normally just use a cheap conditioner or a low ""poo"" product as a cleansing agent.  I thought I'd give this a try as I really love the intensive conditioner in this same line.  It does say ""no sulfates"" but it is really way too sudsy and shampoo-y for my taste.  I will continue to use the intensive conditioner and use up the rest of this shampoo but go back to using conditioner or the Devacurl Low-poo cleaner which I've always liked."
353,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A god send!,"So far I am loving this. I just started with this product because my brother uses it so I had to purchase my own. Paired perfectly with the corresponding conditioner which I also purchased is a god send to my hair. Other shampoos and conditioners would dry my hair and leave it super tangled, but with this I just washed conditioned, removed excess water and went about my day. Also seems to be helping with frizz which is a big plus."
354,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great For Low Prosity Hair!,"This shampoo, conditioner,  and mask is excellent for low prosity 3c, 4abc hair. Such Amazing lather with the shampoo! Silkness/slickness with conditioner and Mask has Ah-mazing Slip makes your waves and curls soft and pop!! This is a ""definite"" on natural hair gal list!!"
355,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,I have tried many shampoos since going natural 3 years ago and my hair hated most but managed to hang in there,"Finally!  It has happened to me!  A product that my hair loves.  I have tried many shampoos since going natural 3 years ago and my hair hated most but managed to hang in there.  My hair was so dry.  I had to apply products every day to keep it moisturizer.  Now I use Shea Hydrating and I don't have to use products every day.  I wash my hair with the shampoo, add lotion, greas, (yeah the Dax is still my go to y'all) and Black Castor Oil Lotion(this stuff is ahmazing!) and my hair loves it.  I can go out in the rain, humidity, etc. without my hair shrinking into a hard dry mess.  I must add that trimming your hair is a must.  I needed a serious trim and after that, my hair rocks.  Finally!  I love my natural hair and it feels so soft and luscious!  I just wished they made a bigger bottle but a little product goes a long way.  I would like a bigger bottle tho, just saying."
356,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,has Manuka Honey ingredient which is a healing agent. Good stuff,I love it. very nice and healing to my scalp and moisturizes my long natural curls. However the last shipment I received the safety seal was off and inside the cap and the bottle leaked a little in shipment. I was disappointed and my next purchase will be in the store so I can make sure the safety seal is on.
357,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Scent Is Too Strong, Irritates Scalp","It does its job as a shampoo. I love the smell. HOWEVER, the smell is too strong. Any heavy perfumes added to hair products irritates my scalp, just like this one did. It made my scalp dry,  scabby and scaly. I cant do this anymore. In the trash it goes."

360,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great shampoo,"Love this shampoo, I've been using it for years, but I think this recent one had a manufacturing defect. It poured out like water when usually it is really thick. It seemed like it was 30% shampoo and 70% water, so much so it poured off my hand so it was hard to try to use it, I had to use half the bottle for one shampoo. I am still giving it a 4 because I really believe there was just something wrong with this one."
361,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silk Making Magic,"My hair had a dryness with a thirst no moisturizer could quench until I started using this shampoo.  Since I have never been happy with sulfate-free shampoos, I had low expectations for this one. This shampoo lathers and cleanses well. My hair is soft from the time I rinse the shampoo out until the next time I wash my hair. The shampoo has a very pleasant smell and a little goes a long way. I can't imagine going back to any other shampoo."

I am able to start the detangling process right after a wash which is a first for me. As in, running my fingers through thick, 4c hair! The scent is yummy and the moisture is nice. I would recommend this for those with dry hair. I purchased mine through Ulta and not Amazon. Ulta always has coupon available so that helps in not being concerned with money lost when trying a new product. I think I am now reformed from my hair product hoarding way as I now have a staple shampoo and conditioner set."
370,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to work great for 4c hair in a protective style,I wash my hair once a week/ 10 days and because this has protein I use this and the conditioner as my protein wash every other week (I use the SM Black Soap purification masque and balancing conditioner as my protein free moisture wash in between)My hair is currently in twists but they seem to clean the scalp well and left my scalp just as soft and moisturized as the Black soap range- which I love!The real test will be washing my hair once out of a protective style.The Manuka Honey range has a much better smell than the the other SM ranges too.

I'm glad I got to try this shampoo because it is alot different than the raw shea one. This one has a nice rich moisturizing lather and cleans well even with oils in my hair. It leaves hair really soft and almost don't need a conditioner after. Nothing like the greasy/dried out feeling of the Raw shea line.

379,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Thumbs down in my opinion,"I bought this shampoo because of all the great reviews it had, but I personally do not like it at all. I’m usually not one to go out of my way to write a negative review, I just personally really didn’t like this shampoo at all. It was very oily and it smells awful. This really is a preference thing, but it ruined it for me. It leaves an oily residue on your hands after you wash your hair. I was just not a fan."

Unfortunately, it left a thick residue on my roots, and it made my hair a bit ratty feeling. The day after, I had to wash with dandruff shampoo to get all the residue out. I'm going to give it another try because I really want to love this shampoo. It might actually be too moisturizing! :\"

I ordered this and tha matching conditioner....for some dumb reason...I called myself wanting to dye my hair cause I thought I was going to get my hair colored and dreaded up...lmao!!! That didn't happen.....so my hair kinda broke off and was extremely dry...but since I hadn't had a relaxer in a yr that kind of helped! But after using this tha first time my hair was so soft and I could actually comb through it! I left tha conditioner in over night with flat twists and rinsed it out tha next day!

402,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does exactly what it is supposed to!!,"The whole Manukau honey set (the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner) did WONDERS for my hair! I saw this method on TikTok where you condition your hair first, shampoo, and then deep condition (I’ll abbreviate it as the C/S/DC method 😜) and BABY let me tell you… my hair has never felt softer and more moisturized! I was a little skeptical at first but now I HIGHLY recommend it if you have dry, low porosity, brittle hair that breaks easily! I used to have TERRIBLE breakage! I mean like losing 3-5 HANDFULS of hair no matter WHAT I did! I’ve tried several different shampoos, conditioners, and deep conditioners… many different oils, I’ve tried finger detangling… I get regular trims from a licensed hairstylist but NOTHING would help with the breakage but baby… doing the C/S/DC method with these products has reduced my breakage GREATLY! In the pic is the amount of hair I’ve lost from START to FINISH!!! Just a palm full!!! My hair has never felt softer and so moisturized and hydrated!!!! I cannot believe that method with these products reduced my hair breakage that much!!!!!!! I’m sure you can do the C/S/DC method with any products from any company but if you’re someone like me that has super dry, brittle hair with low porosity and breaks off easily I’d recommend these from Shea Moisture!! And the manukau honey set smells AMAZING too and the scent lasts which is a plus!!! I’m super excited now I feel like my hair is really going to start growing and getting stronger now I’ll be sure to update if anything changes !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

Been using it about 3 weeks now and my hair feels in much better condition probably due to the lack of chemicals in this one (it's all natural stuff).  Lathers up nicely and rinses well.  I use with the Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner and they partner very well.  Did wash my hair in my old brand as a comparison and hair felt noticeably drier but on reverting to this again, the shine came straight back. Highly recommend if you want to calm frizz and have nice bouncy curls!"

PEROOOOO cuando el pelo se seca es otra cosaaa, como el champú tiene aceites como base, el cuero cabelludo queda super grasoso, Tal vez esto no le pase a las chavas con poquito pelo, yo tengo un PELUCON, son como 3 cabezas en 1, la primera vez pensé que tal vez no me había tallado bien, la segunda me aseguré de hacerlo por secciones y que el producto llegara hasta la raíz e hiciera su espumita y todo...y cuando lo sequé con secadora, Dios mio, eran como gajos de pelo de lo aceitoso que estaba mi cuero cabelludo."

Once I tried this, I never want to go back to those heavy chemical popular shampoo brands in the stores anymore. This Manuka Honey Shampoo has a great smell and it leaves moisture on my hair after wash. Hair feels much better and naturally glossier - but not oily. The popular shampoo brands often get my hair dirty and oily after a day and I have to wash hair everyday or else it is too oily - even on days I didn’t go out of the house or didn’t do much activities to be sweaty or dirty. Hence, I only use this product for me and my partner from now on."

525,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"I have to say I'm pretty impressed. I've not had any luck trying Shea Moisture products in the last two years. I've tried various, especially from the famed Coconut and Hibiscus line and hated every single one of them due to their sickly stench and the amount I had to use to look just barely presentable. My hair was made frizzy so I gave them away to my mum who also hated them and threw them away. I was very put off trying Shea Moisture again but seeing so many new product lines and their introduction to stores near me, which otherwise neglect curly hair products, made me want to try once more.This was a pleasant surprise. It smells perfumed and slightly earthy. When wet it smells like macadamia nuts, which I like, so it made me rather pleased. The first time I used it, I had to prepare myself to throw it away because it instantly made my strands stick together as it lathered up so fiercely. But after washing it out fully, my hair felt fine. Not super moisturised like the product claims, honestly, but the way I've always expected from a gentle shampoo. My hair doesn't feel stripped, but just before that stage at super clean. My scalp isn't irritated, I'm guessing that's due to the lack of hard sulfates as I can no longer use regular shampoos that make my scalp burn and itch.I'm still questioning whether I should get it again because As I Am's Coconut Cowash is super moisturising and cleansing at the same time. And I really have a lot of hair and want to keep my wash routine to as minimal steps as possible and the cowash lets me get away with not needing to shampoo and then condition. We'll see, but so far the cowash is winning out as it is also the cheaper of the two for a bigger volume of product. So, if the shampoo were cheaper, I might just designate it my new default cleanser. That being said, I love the packaging and my success with this product has encouraged me to not completely give up hope buying Shea Moisture products in the future.Now if only a wider variety was available' on Amazon...Edit: After much deliberation, I've decided to go back to my cowash. It's cheaper and all of the scabs and itchiness that I used to deal with daily from my sulfate conditioners have returned with this shampoo. It is NOT SULFATE FREE. I do feel lied to, I look on the ingredients, while it has only softer sulfates in it, they're still sulfates. I decided to continue using it because I wanted to give the product a chance but now my scalp is suffering and my hair has become extremely dry over time (this being the only new product to be incorporated into my regular routine) to the point where I have had to cut my hair. I found that many companies are now labelling their products as sulfate free and are not, so be careful."
526,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,It helps the hair by not removing all hydration. I am satisfied.
527,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Ich liebe die Produkte von shea moistur. Nicht alle Produkte sind für mein glattes Haar geeignet aber diese Feuchtigkeitspflege ist perfekt. Die Reihe versorgt ausgiebig mit Feuchtigkeit ohne das Haar zu beschweren. Der Geruch nach Honig ist sehr intensiv, für mich völlig ok. Gerade wenn ich meine Haare wieder mal mit dem Lockenstab  maltretiert habe, sagen sie es nur so auf. Ein Traum, absolute Kaufempfehlung auch für glattes Haar :)"
528,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"My menopausal hair has suffered greatly recently. I have tried endless shampoos from expensive to cheap with no success, the dryness and the frizz looked set to stay until I found manuka honey. I was sceptical but the lather is thick and creamy and as I rinsed I could instantly feel a difference in my hair. It's not the cheapest shampoo but it's worth every penny, the scent isnt coco chanel but it's pleasant and who cares anyway when you finally have soft shiny hair again. This shampoo will suit everyone but to ladies of a certain age I say GO FOR IT you won't regret it"
529,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"This changed my hair from the first use. Usually when I shampoo my hair, it feels scraggly and straw-like immediately afterwards, even with shower water running on it, but with this shampoo it feels slick and smooth. It also has a light pleasant scent. I use it about once a week to get rid of conditioner and styling lotion build up."

535,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Bis jetzt - das beste Shampoo, das ich je hatte und auch mein Lieblingsshampoo geworden! Ich hatte viele Produkte von SM für Haare ausprobiert, u.a. auch Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo lange Zeit benutzt, aber dieses Shampoo gefällt mir viiiiiel besser! Es schäumt überhaupt nicht und fühlt sich an den Haaren eher wie ein Conditioner an, auch nach der Haarwäsche habe ich immer so ein Gefühl, als ob meine Haare keine Spülung mehr brauchen. Ich benutze trotzdem immer eine von SM. Also die Haare fühlen sich nicht ausgetrocknet und genährt - perfekt für meine normalerweise sehr trockene und strapazierte Locken. Auch der Geruch des Shampoos ist m.M.n. sehr angenehm und nicht aufdringlich. Es reinigt die Haare und Kopfhaut sehr gut, obwohl es schäumt überhaupt nicht. Also ich bin super zufrieden!"

Kann ich nur empfehlen!"
537,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Bisher war ich immer mit meinem naturkrausen Haaren zufrieden (Ich benutze seit mehreren Jahren nur noch Naturshampoos ohne Parabene, Silikone etc.). Nun teste ich dieses Shampoo 1 Monat und muss leider feststellen, dass meine Haare sich zwar während des Waschens gut anfühlen. Jedoch wenn diese getrocknet sind bekomme ich schuppige Kopfhaut und die Haare fühlen sich am Ansatz super fettig (meine Haarbürste ist voll damit) und an den Enden wie Stroh an. Der Duft ist sehr aufdringlich, man kann sich aber dran gewöhnen (wenn man gerne riecht wie eine gute Parfümflasche dann ist das wohl das richtige Shampoo). Meine Naturlocken haben sich übrigens verringert. Ich würde es nicht wieder kaufen."

544,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Sulfate-Free 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"I’ve been using this shampoo for more than two years now and always loved it, BUT I recently bought another bottle and something has certainly changed! It lathers up just like other sulphate shampoos, convincing me this is NOT sulphate free. I knew something was wrong when I poured it out of my latest bottle - the consistency and colour were different. Then it lathered up on use. Sulphate free shampoos do not lather! The ingredient list has changed. They’ve now started using fake fragrance (aka Parfum) instead of natural fragrance sources. The ingredients they list as not being included has drastically reduced (i.e., the bad stuff in the shampoo is increasing). It’s a shame that a brand like theirs is trying to cut corners to make a quick buck at the cost of giving customers a truly good, natural product. Don’t expect the same shampoo if you’ve been a regular user like me!"

6,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Moisturizing Hair Conditioner Ever,"The packaging is very nice. The colors made me feel a sense of peace and harmony. I like the colors so much.  It’s easy to use and easy to hold.  I like that it had a pump because usually the jar conditioners get water in them from the shower, but the pump keeps the conditioner un- diluted and when I  finish with the conditioner,  I  turn the spout closed to keep the conditioner fresh and free of air. I Love the scent;  vanilla - honey. I love the ingredients. The texture-consistency is thick. I have  a combination of 2c-3a-c hair andSheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Conditioner melted into my hair. It was a great experience.  It has slip and 3 minutes after  applying it to pre-sectioned hair,  I finger detangled and kept it in my hair until I finished my shower. The conditioner left my skin hydrated too. I Love this conditioner and will buy again. Definitely going to recommend."

9,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,THE SMELLLL 😳,"I’m African American with relaxed hair and I have to say this product has gave my hair a lot more moisture! The back of my head is always the driest so I’m not surprised that it’s still kind of dry back there, but the rest of my hair felt soft and moisturized. T H E  S M E L L I S  S O  N I C E, I don't even know how else to describe it! This product also made my hands very soft but beware, I received it in the mail and it kept spilling from the top so I had to wipe it down like 3 times and also because of this virus going around. After i wiped it I topped it up real tight and the problem was solved! I ordered another and these things ship really fast, the first one arrived really quick. I'm still stuck on the smell though, its so good and i will continue to use this on my hair."
10,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I was a skeptic but I really like this on my black dry hair,"I'm a black guy and never really thought about using anything in my hair, since I usually cut my hair low. But decided to grow it out this year to a little fro. So of course, now I notice my hair is dry and coarse and leaves me with dry scalp. That changed when my wife told me to get something for my hair.Decided to start with this conditioner after reading the reviews and after 2 times using it, my hair is noticeably softer, easier to manage (pick and comb) and no more dry scalp or tangles in the hair.This may have different results for other people but from going to using NOTHING in my hair for 30 years to using this, it is a HUGE improvement. I will be getting their hydrating shampoo next to test that out."
11,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best conditioner I have ever used!,"I have naturally curly hair. Maybe 2C or 3A/3B, I don't know. I could never figure it out. It's dry, it's frizzy. It's thick, long, curly hair. I use a wet brush in the shower after putting in this conditioner, and it's like a magic elixir. Knots slip away. And it's not like a detangler....no. It doesn't feel slippery(or somehow dry) at all like that. I've been using it for about a year and it has transformed my hair. So much less frizz. I don't even use a frizz product anymore. I use a little of this as a leave in. In fact, I only barely wash it out when I wash my hair. On days I don't wash my hair, I wet it a bit and add a few pumps of this conditioner.  I have no more breakage and my hair is super soft and smells divine. All this PLUS it's not tested on animals (very important to me) nor does it have harmful chemicals. And they give to charitable causes.I will use this forever if possible!"
12,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for long straight hair prone to tangle,"With all the high reviews, I wanted to like this conditioner, but it did nothing to condition my very long straight hair that is prone to get tangled.  Perhaps this would be good for someone with a different type of hair, but for me it was a big waste of money as I still needed other conditioning products afterwards to actually condition and detangle my hair.  Plus I thought it smelled strange, like some kind of patchouli or musky smell, not what I want my clean hair to smell like."
13,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells fantastic,"This stuff smells amazing and, true to its word, makes my hair crazy soft. I have to use T-Sal shampoo for a scalp condition, which dries my hair out to straw, and this counteracts that in a way a lot of other conditioners don't.I will say that I use a ton of this every time because it doesn't lather and seems to kind of disappear as I try to work it into my hair ... it's about the consistency of hand lotion so in thick or long hair a little bit doesn't seem to go far. Also I have 2c/3a curly hair and while this seems to prevent frizz, it loosens the curls up instead of defining them, so they have about half the volume I'm used to. Could be a good thing, depending on your hair type; for me it means I use an additional product to get the shape back.Seriously, though, I'd buy it for the smell."
14,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hair softer than it has been in months.,"So I have dry damaged hair that needs some love. I've tried various products and none of quite delivered. I need a few more dollars for free shipping and this had high reviews so I tried it out.I just got it today so here is my first impression.The smell is good but super strong. If they halved the smell it would be perfect.I just got my hair wet in the shower and applied root to tip. I Saturday every strand and put a shower cap on. Lefted on for 20 minutes and rinsed with cold water. I then took a small pump and worked it into my damp hair as a leave in.Now nothing is a miracle conditioner so my hair still isn't the best, however it feels better than it has in a couple months. I'll keep using it and update how my hair feels after I finish my first bottle"
15,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle and pump need improvement,"Love everything about this product and other similar conditioners from this company... except the pumps. I’ve bought this and others several times and I always have to take off the pump and dispense without it when I’m barely halfway through using the bottle. It’s like the pump won’t support the thickness of the product. A squeeze bottle with cap would work much more effectively. In fact, I took a cap from another bottle (I believe a shampoo) and it worked perfectly up until the end. Improve the packaging and this would be a perfect product."

17,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best,I won’t buy any other shampoo. Since using this for a month less frizz my hair looks healthier feels soft and for the 1st time since I’ve decided to grow my hair out I love my hair. I have thick hair. With both shampoo & conditioner I can tame my crazy hair. Best part it’s not dried out and more. It has took a month to see a difference but wow. I’ve always hated my hair. Not now. Shampoo does make a difference and how u use it. I highly recommend
18,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,My product must have been OLD...,"I haven't tried this conditioner and the first time I used it was when I wasn't feeling too well, and I thought it was just my sense of smell playing tricks on me...so I had my old man come into the bathroom to take a whiff of my hair, and after two seconds he made a face confirming that this stuff is indeed SMELLY. It smells like something...at least one of the ingredients has gone putridly BAD. I still tried to use it, followed by another better smelling conditioner, but I'm not sure it even works well anymore."
19,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Helped my damaged hair,Wasn’t expecting to like this conditioner as much as I do! My son sat next to me and asked me what smelled good and it was my hair lol Also my husband is super sensitive to scents and usually hates all the perfumes and body washes I get but he liked this. Before I got in the shower my hair was a bit tangly and afterward it got all the tangles out just from conditioning it. Definitely hooked me with that.
20,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,From Desert to Rainforest.,"I had been using a co-wash (I won't name it) that I'd thought to be good. It made my hair look and feel great the day of, and day after washing. However, I began to notice after those two days, my hair and scalp were dry. Sahara desert dry. I'd oil my scalp and the dryness would ensue.I needed a change. I decided, after remembering success with previous She Moisture products, to give this line a try: It changed my life.My hair went from parched to lush. My curls are more defined. My follicles are silky and strengthened. The shine factor is on 100 (People have been asking me if I had my hair dyed).Suffice it to say, this will be my go-to line of hair products. It works for me. The price is right. And it smells amazing."
21,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these products,"I have used many of Shea's products and none of them have disappointed me. I utilize their leave in conditioners as well as the ones you rinse out. I have curly hair that tends to get frizzy easily. My only dislike is this pump bottle. When the product is almost finished, it is difficult to retrieve the bottom contents. I end up having to take the pump off and bang the bottle or add water and use the rest. Same issue with their body lotions. They are thick and well made but difficult to retrieve from the bottles."
22,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure if it the true product,"I’ve bought this product several times from Sally’s and Walmart, however due to the coronavirus I’ve not been out so I bought this online. It doesn’t smell the same or feel the same at all! I really hope it’s the true product as I STRICTLY follow the curly girl method and do not put products in my hair that’s not curly girl approved"
23,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Softens, Moisturizes The Co. donates 10%  to Community Commerce",It has a nice honey smell.  It's color safe. The only thing I didn't like was the way it arrived. It should have been wrapped in bubble wrap or a bubble pouch. The top push dispenser arrived broken off because they just threw the item in the box it seems. Fortunately it didn't leak or spill and all of the contents are there. When I use it I will just have to remove the cap which is not a big problem or anything.  13 ounces for under $10 so this will last for some time. Overall I am happy with the product and this purchase.
24,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, definitely ""conditions"" but sticks to my hair like none other...","I really want to like this conditioner, and for reference I have 3A curls, but for whatever reason this product weighs super heavy on my hair. Not only that but it makes my curl pattern extra strange and seperate more in a weird way so they are thinner vs thicker by the end of the day. My biggest grip would be the leftover residue after a shower. It's as if I had put in a leave-in but instead of softness it has more of a waxy feel.I'd imagine this product works well for someone with very very fine and dry hair. I personally have very thick, not to dry strands which may be why this didn't work for me. The smell is great and it feels good to put in my hair and detangle during the shower but thats it..."
25,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,You won’t regret buying this !!!,This is absolutely my favorite conditioner! The scent is subtle and so wonderful. I once used use a cheap shampoo and my hair felt sooooo dry and stripped so I decided to give this conditioner a try and oh my words it’s the best decision I’ve ever made. It melted into my strands and immediately my hair felt so moisturized and looked healthy and shiny. I love love love this conditioner and the hair mask in this line is heaven sent as well. Don’t second guess just purchase ! You won’t regret it !
26,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy,"This smells fantastic, but unfortunately no amount of rinsing worked to get it out, I rinsed for about 3 minutes the second time I used it and it still left my hair greasy and gross, it even made it shed out way more than normal. My daughter had the same problems. Thankfully they refunded me no problem."
27,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,This product has protein in it!,"I have 3C/4A high porosity virgin hair and I follow the curly girl method. I was not aware that this had protein in it. I used it right before I did a protein treatment and one side of my hair came out crunchy. Luckily, I noticed and performed two deep condition treatments to fix the issue. I would not recommend this product to individuals who have hair like mine."
28,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's really thin, about the consistency of cheap lotion",I only bought this because it was recommended as a beard co-wash by one of my favorite Youtubers and i regret spending the $7 lol. It's really think so idk if it's counterfeit but i do know that most Shea moisture products i'm familiar with seem to have a thicker consistency. I'm bout the whole She Moisture Men's beard line and a lotion and them were all thick and had a weight to them. This product is very thin and has no real moisturizing or conditioning properties. You're better off either buying it from a real store or going trying a different product altogether.
29,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have coarse & dry hair, this conditioner won’t cut it","I have coarse, wavy Asian hair that has been chemically processed (balayage and dyed). My hair is pretty dry and I had high hopes for this conditioner, but it was pretty disappointing. It was thin and not very moisturizing. I used about 2 big handfuls to cover my hair and I had to add a different conditioner, because it just wasn’t cutting it. Smells lovely though!"
30,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for my 2B,2C, 3A textures","I have a different curl patterns in different sections of my head and have allot of hair .I have a mix of normal & thick hair strands. Ive been searching for an amazing conditioner for so long ! This is it, this conditioner changed the game for me ! I use this conditioner with this type of shampoo, hair masque, and use curl cream and Dippity Doo gel :) i have good hair days now :’) I used to be insecure of my birds nest looking for the right products to use !"
31,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells lovely!,"My favorite thing about this conditioner is the smell. There are lots of great conditioners out there but what makes this one distinctive is its wonderful scent. It even lingers throughout the day after you have rinsed it off (which some people may or may not want in a conditioner). In addition to the scent, it makes my hair smooth but not greasy looking. My hair definitely feels healthy and full after using it.Update: The dispenser on the conditioner broke after about a week. This is the second time that it's happened with this product (I assumed the first time was a fluke). It doesn't bother me too much--it's easy to just take the cap off and use it that way but it is worth noting. Still a great conditioner though."
32,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Crunchy Hair,"I tried this and the paired shampoo as a high moisture shampoo/conditioner as a replacement for the Devacurl Decadence line (made my scalp itchy). I have high porosity, 3b/3c curls that need a lot of moisture, so I thought for sure that this ""intensive hydration"" combo would be a good fit. Not the case, unfortunately. After the first use, my hair is crunchy, dry, and rough. Really bummed, but will be looking for other products."
33,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Love Love!,Smell is amazing and so are my results. You only need a little of this amazing stuff. I’ve been natural for 8 years and since I’ve been using Shea Moisture Products my hair has responded completely different in terms of moisture and growth. This works especially well for those of us that suffer from dry hair (a lot of natural women do) Try it and see for yourself. Love this stuff!
34,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Is it the glycerin?,"I don't know what it is about my hair and Shea Moisture, but the brand does not work for me (with one exception). I have fine, color-treated, long 3A curls, and I co-wash. This was too heavy and left my hair both greasy and frizzy. I had a similar problem with the much-recommended coconut-hibiscus line. In contrast, the JBCO leave-in does work for me. In short, fine-haired curlies look elsewhere."
35,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stinks,"The smell. Horrible! The most strongest perfume scented conditioner I've ever used. I bought it to use on my daughter's ethnic curls and the smell lasts for DAYS. Even others have made comments, like, ""what is in her hair, that's so strong!"" I make sure to rinse it really well, but it doesn't help."
36,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite so far.,"Light conditioner, not hard to coat hair. I ring out my hair after shampooing and let it sit for a few minutes to ensure the conditioner is used efficiently because its more on the pricy side. I loved how my hair felt and looked afterwards. Accentuated the texture in my hair, no frizz and not weighted down. The bottle did leak a bit in shipping."
37,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a conditioner I like!,"I've recently gotten into using conditioners without sulfates, parabens, phthalates, or dimethicone and this one is great. It smells like honey and it made my hair feel so nice and soft and my hair smells fantastic. This conditioner is pretty light in consistency but you don't need much to get the benefits. I have long natural blonde curly/wavy dry hair and this worked great for me."
38,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like this conditioner,"I bought this product along with the shampoo and I really like it. It smells very good and moisturizes my strands. I have about 3a-3b hair and it works really well! The only issue I have with this conditioner is how much I find myself using. The consistency is very thin and I find myself using multiple pumps to get my hair to the softness I want. The scent is also pleasant, I really enjoy it but for some it may be a bit strong. This scent’s intensity can be easily overcome by a leave in conditioner or a leave in hair oil though. Overall, would recommend buying."
39,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not moisturizing!,"When I bought this product it said it was ultra hydrating and moisturizing.. that is not the case. The product itself is really thin, not something I would typically describe a moisturizing conditioner to be. Along with it being a very thin product, I don’t think it’s very moisturizing at all. I put about 4 pumps of product onto my hair, and it felt like almost nothing was there. I’m sad to say that I didn’t enjoy this product, because I love Shea Moisture products"
40,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Dissatisfied...,This product has the Honey as 14th ingredient and it only says Honey and not Manuka Honey. The package came open and I got half of the product in the bottle. Besides those two things is a good product for now... I honestly thought it had better ingredients.
41,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Results,"This stuff, in combination with Shea Moisture Bamboo Charcoal Deep Cleansing Shampoo works very well. My hair is very thick and coarse and I had some dandruff going on before I used these two products.  Dandruff is gone, my hair has never been this soft and easy to comb. Even when my hair has dirty build-up, the shampoo always lathers up the first time. I highly recommend these two products. Two thumbs up to Shea Moisture. Oh, I am a middle aged black man."
42,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Loving it but arrived just half of it,"I love the product but only half of it arrived. Awful package (no protection). It's my holy grail but seriously, why would you send a fluid product like that?Previous review: I have a 3B low porosity hair and I'm actually using this as a leave-in conditioner. The smell is quite peculiar but after a bit, you just get used to it and I really like it, it leaves my hair bouncy with just scrunching. The only downside is that if I leave my hair just with this product for more than two days it starts to look greasy but, anyway, it's not designed to be used a leave in. It just takes really good care of my hair so as a conditioner or even to use as deep conditioner (use a plastic cap and leave it all night) it's just amazing!"

44,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was hoping for,"I think I must be slightly allergic to something in this, it burns when it touches my scalp. I bought this thinking it'd be good to rehydrate my hair after swimming... it's actually worse than my regular conditioner. My hair is frizzier and crispier."

46,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is everything,"I had a bad reaction to coconut when I used this the first time. Turns out it was the hair oil I used along with this with coconut as the first ingredient.  I have natural hair and this stuff was AMAZING.  I bought two sets of shampoo and condition because it was a great price.  GET THIS if you have a sensitivity to coconut, but you want to get something that will make your hair feel and smell amazing!"
47,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Scent is too strong,"What a bummer.  Looking at the product, I thought it had all the natural ingredients.  Somehow the scent was very strong, too strong for no reasons.

We tried this conditioner and no one in our family likes it. The scent is SO strong!! 😳 If you read in the ingredients it just says ‘fragrance (essential oil blend)’ as one of the first few ingredients. This is a big disappointment to us as it’s overpowering and triggers my allergies. Will not be purchasing and/or recommending.

52,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best conditioner ever!,I bought this along with the shampoo and leave in conditioner of the same scent. This conditioner is AMAZING! My hair was so moisturized and easy to manage and I had zero tangles. My hair was so easy to part and blow dry. I usually go to the salon but because of the weather I had to do it at home. I can’t wait for the next 3 weeks when I have to do my hair again. If you’re on the fence don’t hesitate. Buy it!
53,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work well,Did not work well.

58,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing but,"For some reason it treats my hair very well.

I am not certain of the scent, but it strikes me as smelling strongly of ""sandalwood""...?It had an overwhelming perfume smell that only subsides a bit with rinsing/drying.  I was super excited to try It due to the positive reviews and am disappointed that it is unusable for me because of the scent."

Yes others work better but no other “clean” or well rated conditioners work this well. I used to use live clean brand until I found they aren’t as “clean” as they claim to be.

73,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s alright,LOVE the smell of this conditioner. I can smell it on my hair for almost 2 days straight. Just wish the conditioner was more moisturizing. I have very fine silky healthy hair and this still isn’t enough for my liking. Leaves my hair super tangled  and it’s super hard to brush after I get out of the shower. My hair was way easier to brush when using my old conditioner. Feel like if you have super dry damaged hair you might want to try a different conditioner.
74,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells off, maybe not authentic?","This shipped quickly but the smell is not very good. Seems to be old product maybe, or not authentic? It’s hard to describe but something is definitely off since SM products usually have a strong, good smell to them. I tried it anyhow but it didn’t do wonders for my dry hair either. Disappointing overall."
75,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not purchase,I am not sure if this is the real product. My scalp was burning and my hair became extremely dry and broke off in patches in the back. Unfortunately I do not trust purchasing hair care products on Amazon anymore. Kind of scary
76,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not what I was hoping,"I wanted to try a healthier conditioner to use as a leave in and unfortunately this one wasn’t it. It leaves my hair super soft! But doesn’t define my curls at all. Would only recommend this product as a regular conditioner. Their mask is amazing tho, been using that for sometime and it’s my favorite!"
77,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Curly/Coily/Kinky Hair,"The scent is great, the condition is good to use for in between deep conditioning and it doesn't irrate my sensitive scalp. The deep conditioner is good to use every other week within this sub product line. This leaves my hair feeling soft, easier to manage my 3b-4a hair to detangle in the shower and out the shower."
78,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice but way too perfumey,"This product is not for people who don't like perfume. As I'm typing this, I can't wait to wash this stuff out of my hair. I didn't use much at all. It is way too strong! My daughter got in our pickup and asked what that perfume smell was. She said several times during our drive that it was way too strong.I do think some people would really like it. My hair feels great, soft and full of body. And my curls are curly, not frizzy."
79,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely Works on Coarse Hair,Many products are not made for my brothers and sisters who have thick and coarse hair. I've been using this for approximately 3 months every single day. My hair is beyond manageable and soft. It also smells very good! I would recommend.
80,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Mild bad fragrance,It does a good job moisturizing but the smell is awful. It's a mild smell that gives you a headache over time. I wish they had not added fragrance. I like another one of their conditioners better because of the smell.
81,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good moisture for course curly hair,I am auto delivery because I use this a lot for my curly shoulder length hair.

86,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very smelly,"Product picture is misleading, as the bottle does not have a pump. My biggest complaint is the scent, which is extremely potent. I have very short hair and can smell it through the day which is unfortunate. It would be ok if it smelled good."
87,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really moisturising,I have natural straight hair and ive been looking for a good moisturising conditioner and this I give 5 stars for what it does.  yes the scent is not very appealing but it doesnt turn me off.

No more itchiness and  dryness. Has a pleasant smell. Contains no harsh chemicals, all natural ingredients. Try the shampoo too. They both work together to keep my hair soft, fresh and clean. Great value."
89,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,Works well and makes my hair so soft! I do have oily hair so I use half a pump of conditioner instead of a full pump and it leaves my hair perfect and smelling great.

93,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Leaks👎,The product is amazing. Makes my hair 10x softer. Smells sweet like honey maybe. The only problem I had was these people clearly don’t know how to wrap stuff up so it doesn't leak/ open. They sent me a free one (because the first one i got leaked all over the place). The second one also leaked all over the place.
94,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stiff where? Here.,Left my hair feeling stiff and unworkable. Did nothing for knots. My hair is thin and this left it looking stringy... not a great look IMO
95,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product ever!!!!!!,"Made my hair really brittle,dry and knotted up!!!!! I had to pay money for a hair dresser and have my hair cut...... And I had a wedding to be in and had to spend extra money due to this horrid product!!!!!!"
96,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generously moisturizing for curls,I think this is a great product. However I bought it for my daughter and I to try and I think it was not the appropriate product for our curl type. Our curls range from type 2a-3b and this product was too heavy and just weighed them down. Would definitely recommend for curl types 3c and up.
97,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing,"Love the scent! Does a great job moisturizing my dry, curly, dyed hair. Recommend-especially since made with organic ingredients."
98,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,SOFTER HAIR,This really has helped and changed the texture of my hair and made it much softer after bleaching for the first time a few months ago. The smell is a little off to me when i first apply it but it smells fine after its washed of and dry.
99,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn’t buy again,"I have dense low porosity 4B curls, didn’t do much after deep conditioning with a cap. I wouldn’t recommend my hair was left dry."
100,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a moisturizing as I hoped,I do not see the moisturizing/hydration benefits of this conditioner. I put a good amount of it in my hair and I always feel like I need to add more and my hair still feels dry. I can’t wait for it to finish.
101,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great slippage,"In the shower, after shampooing, I work this through my hair. Then after I wash my body, I begin to comb my hair and the tangles are minimal and my hair is the most TANGLY TANGLES in knots without this product."
102,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,I love this product. I am a African American male maintaining a fro and have a very dry scalp and head naturally. This product is a great moisturizer! I do leave the moisturizer on my head for about 15 min though even though it’s says 3. Seems to be a little more efficient with results( especially if you have thick hair and live in a humid area) if it sets for a little bit.
103,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,"I’ve tried a couple other Shea moisture products but this by far has been the worst of them. It did not hydrate my hair, it left my hair feeling sticky and not soft, and the smell was horrendous. I do not recommend."

It makes my hair so soft and shiny and for the first time in years it doesn’t feel like straw- I will probably use this for the rest of my life. Also, smells amazing."
105,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Need to package better for shipping,"The product itself is great. Unfortunately, the top was not secured and about 1/3 of the bottle leaked all over the other items in the box. Previous orders had always had tge top secured or the entire bottle enclosed in a bag."
106,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!!,"Best conditioner I've ever used!

116,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,This is not a Leave-in Conditioner. STOP PUTTING Regular Conditioner in the category,This came up in the leave in conditioner section so it was ordered this in fact is not a leave in conditioner so something in Amazon's algorithm as well as the customer vendor needs to be changed so people can stop ordering a bunch of conditioner they don't need.

127,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice conditioner,Smells good. Easy on hair. Would work better on medium hair and shorter. Long hair needs to use more at a time.

I have never really found a product that isn't bought in a salon for $$$$ that works to tame my mane.  A few years ago, I started looking into these products I was using. Everything from hair care, to skin and face care, to what I was eating, soap, toothpaste, and found that many of these products were poisoning me.  Well, I started to switch out my products, but it has taken me 3 YEARS to finally find this beautiful product.  It works even better than any of the old salon products I have used to moisturize and add shine to my hair (Tame the mane!), and unfortunately, much better than any other comparatively natural products I have tried up until this point. The waitress at the local diner that I frequent even commented that my hair looked healthy! (YAY!) Anyways, I'm going to quit ranting, but I can't say enough good things about this product, and for the price, it's a steal. Try it,  you won't regret it."

390,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Love Love It!,"Absolutely the best natural conditioner I've ever used... I have thick, fine to medium, color treated Caucasian hair that has a slight wave to it. I've moved away from shampoos/conditioners that have sulfates and silicones as silicones will coat the hair shaft and keep moisture out. You can slather your hair with any moisturizer/oil but if the hair shaft is covered in silicone, it won't penetrate. I use the Shea Moisture Retention shampoo and follow with the Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Conditioner; which I leave on for a few minutes in the shower. I find it has plenty of slip (for a non-silicone product) and the scent is FABULOUS. My hair is shiny, healthy and full of body - and did I mention the fabulous scent?? I loved the smell so much I bought the Manuka Honey & Mafura bar soap at my local Fred Meyer store, which actually moisturized better than the Olay body wash I'd been using, without the harsh sulfates and chemicals. Totally love this line :)"

416,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for THICK curly hair! Must try!,"I've been using this conditioner for years prior to buying it on amazon (cheaper than Target). But I went to the reviews, and noticed that they do not do this product justice at all; so I wanted to leave an informative review! This conditioner is thick and hydrating; you want to make sure your hair is very wet when applying to create slip which allows for easy detangling (I use a spray bottle). It is great to pair with an oil - I detangle with just the conditioner and add coconut oil on my shaft and scalp afterwards to seal the moisture. Then you would want to let it sit in your hair for over 30 minutes (I understand the bottle says otherwise, and you don't reap the benefits in 3-5 minutes). I usually let mines sit in my hair overnight in a plastic cap (or at least 30 min. if I'm in a hurry). Note, a plastic cap or sitting under a dryer allows the product to penetrate the follicles even further; leaving your hair silky soft.  Before you know it, your hair will be revitalized! This is perfect when coming from protective styles and from straightening your hair; but this is my every week conditioner! I have kinky curly thick wavy curls (hard to describe I think ima a 3C/4A mix) - I actually don’t like the deep masque conditioner but this one I def recommend for 3/4 hair types. As a former product junky, I hope this helped someone!"

419,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy grail for low porosity hair,"I took care of my hair. Didn't dye it, used sulfate-free/silicone-free everything, hardly used heat on it, but one day I noticed my curls weren't what they used to be (2c, 3a). They were stretched out and limp. I tried protein treatments and ""deep conditioners"" to no prevail. I tried at least 4 different regular conditioners but none seemed to help with moisture (even the ones $30+). I finally found out that I have severely low porosity hair when I did the strand test and after an hour my hairs were still floating on top. Desperate, I tried this on a whim. I've tried other Shea Moisture products before and liked them, but never found a conditioner I loved. Enter this stuff. I paired it with their almond oil (I leave on overnight from scalp to ends then wash the next day) and my hair has transformed from broken, snapped strands and dry limp frizz, into silky strands with strength. I can't stop touching it! Those two products are the only items that have actually penetrated my low porosity hair and I'm crazy grateful to feel normal again. My curls are back and bouncy! (The almond oil has made my hair and eyebrows grow like crazy too.)"

I just combed out my locs after 5 years so I’m starting my natural hair journey from scratch and this is the only product I’ve found so far that my hair absolutely LOVES it’s so incredibly moisturizing I just want to leave it in forever and it smells heavenly. I’ve got a ton of 4b/c hair with thin strands I think low porosity? Cool water has 0 effect on my hair. Hope this helps.
422,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"Awesome stuff! It does what it says on the bottle. It conditions hair and leaves it feeling soft and manageable after washing. It feels like a light lotion and provides enough slip (well at least for me, straight hair) to detangle. My favorite aspect of this conditioner is that it rinses fast, easily, and cleanly. I hate heavy conditioners that leave residue and weigh me down. It also smells really good, like honeyed syrup. My hair is less frizzy after washing it, I will probably buy more for my mum and me."
423,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Ingredients but not worth the money,I have super dry hair and tried the conditioner which didn’t seem to help much. I realize I haven’t had my hair trimmed in over two years so I trimmed it myself and all of a sudden my hair is perfectly healthy and I don’t need to spend eight dollars on conditioner anymore.
424,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture rich detangling,"I love this conditioner  and the shampoo for that matter. For the first time, while natural (nearly 4 years now), I've found a product that adequately hydrates AND detangles my dense, 4c hair. Combing through it is a cinch. Blow drying is too. The smell, I love it. I know a few have said its a bit much but I think that is a preference thing. I am pretty discriminating when it comes to scent and the strength thereof and find the smell to be highly tolerable but then again, preference. Glad I gave it a try."
425,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes detangling so easy!,I love this conditioner! It makes detangling so easy! Even better her curls look amazing. I like the scent but wish it was a little less intense.  We have tried MANY of the SheaMoisture products and really like the line but this is by far my favorite of all their products.
426,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Your hair may require more than this product is willing to give.,"Smells wonderful...all natural ingredients...spreads easily through hair and doesn't leave hair tangled after using. Also, it's pretty fast acting in that you don't have to leave it on for longer than 5-10 minutes. It gives the illusion of being soft and able to maintain, but I feel that it could be a bit better at actually HYDRATING  the hair. So in conclusion, I would recommend this product if your hair already has great moisture retention and just needs a boost here and there. But if you need more than a boost, don't waste your money!"
427,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely and effective,Lovely and effective for my goal. I wanted something to sooth some dry skin and help detangle a bit. This is doing quite nicely. It also has a mild scent and silky texture which are a nice little treat on a busy day.
428,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best of Shea Moisture.  Best PERIOD,I am obsessed with this conditioner. my curls are bouncy and smooth.  I can go without washing for 2 days and still retain the same style without frizz. My GOD does it define my curls. More coiled ringlets than the loose springs they were before. I adore the scent. I get so many compliments on my hair while at work. I use a LOT of shea moisture products but this has been BY FAR my favorite!❤

I tried to make SURE I had rinsed it all out, but it still left it looking on the greasy side. As I blew dried my hair it was not as manageable as it was with other products. I finally decided to return it rather than throw it away, but I was about a wk. too late."
430,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,SO WORTH IT,"I can’t believe how great this product works.. I have been looking for something to help my hair because it does not hold onto moisture whatsoever, since I’ve used this my hair breaks WAY less almost nothing and my hair has felt soft and not crunchy, my hair is wavy but extremely dry and the last year it had been breaking off, nothing I tried seemed to help until this purchase. I might be a user for the rest of my life. (Great for protein sensitive hair)"
431,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good product,"I bought this after I heard it recommended by Youtuber Nappyheadedjojoba. It smells great, and leaves my hair moisturized, soft, strengthened, and luscious. I wouldn't say this is a conditioner with great 'slip,' necessarily, but the fact that my hair is so soft after rinsing it out makes up for it. I follow up with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave in conditioner to detangle, and then I'm good to go."
432,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle for bleached hair,"This stuff is amazing. You can get it cheaper in store at Ulta though. My hair is bleach blonde (I'm white, but my hair is crazy dry from the bleach) and after using this my hair feels incredibly smooth. I used my waver and the shine was amazing. It also smells really nice and it doesn't fade out fast. My hair normally is easy to make greasy, even though it's very very dry, but this product just makes my hair incredible, it's outright transforming how much nice my hair looks and feels when I use this. My only complaint is that the shampoo doesn't really lather, I'm used to lather. I keep recommending it to other women with bleached hair, that's how much I love it."

The other one I like is the Coconut Hibiscus conditioner. They both detangle the best for me and have the best scent in my opinion. I tried the Raw Shea Butter and the Rose conditioners, and those did not detangle well for me at all, and I didn't care for the scent of those either."

It has great slip, which is nice for my Type 4 hair, but unfortunately it's more drying instead of moisturizing, or maybe irritating, but by the end of the day, no matter what I try, my scalp itches like crazy when I use this. Mentioned it to other people I've seen use it and they've mentioned the same thing. Sucks cause I'm really in love with the smell. The Deep Masque Treatment did the same thing.

444,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for me!,"This conditioner is really good for dry, damaged hair.  My hair is color treated and I also use heated styling tools several times a week so dryness is always an issue.  This conditioner hydrates really well, leaving my hair soft and shiny.  It also has a lot of ""slip"" so detangling is easy and it smells like wildflower honey!  It's really rich and thick and I've found that leaving it on for about 5 minutes helps it work even better.  I also use the Manuka Honey shampoo, which is sulfate free and therefore color safe.  It lathers really well and is very moisturizing.  When I use these two products, my hair is very smooth and soft and very manageable.  I've been using them for about a month and definitely notice a big difference.  My hair is very healthy looking now and super shiny and frizz free.  These products have done wonders for my dry, lifeless tresses.  I definitely recommend them both.  However, you can purchase them at Ulta or Target for $10-$11 apiece, so don't pay the outrageous Amazon price!"

I was hesitant but it was definitely worth it.,I am so glad I got this. I've heard so many good things about this product but after trying their virgin coconut oil line (horrid) I was a little worried. (The picture is of my ends right after I woke up the next day)Pros:-smells FANTASTIC like a beautiful sweet fruit herb garden-Very thick and moisturizing just how I like my conditioners-Makes my hair curlier (2c-3a)-Makes my hair smooth and less frizzy-lightweight yet very lucious-Makes me happyCons:-there's less in the bottle than you would think. It starts like an inch below the top and isn't very densly packed so I imagine with my very long hair it will go by fast unless I suppliment with another conditioner.-Bottle is plastic (bad for the environment and hard to dispose) it would be great if it was 100% recycled plastic but I couldn't find anything like that. (Maybe I just didn't check the bottle well enough) I understand other alternatives would probably make it expensive and out of my price range though.

I was prepared to leave it on for one hour, but within  15 - 20 mins it had me coughing and sneezing. I could taste it...it smells like they  put an entire bottle of perfume in it.

I saw this method on TikTok where you condition your hair first, shampoo, and then deep condition (I’ll abbreviate it as the C/S/DC method 😜) and BABY let me tell you… my hair has never felt softer and more moisturized! I was a little skeptical at first but now I HIGHLY recommend it if you have dry, low porosity, brittle hair that breaks easily! I used to have TERRIBLE breakage! I mean like losing 3-5 HANDFULS of hair no matter WHAT I did! I’ve tried several different shampoos, conditioners, and deep conditioners… many different oils, I’ve tried finger detangling… I get regular trims from a licensed hairstylist but NOTHING would help with the breakage but baby… doing the C/S/DC method with these products has reduced my breakage GREATLY! In the pic is the amount of hair I’ve lost from START to FINISH!!! Just a palm full!!! My hair has never felt softer and so moisturized and hydrated!!!! I cannot believe that method with these products reduced my hair breakage that much!!!!!!! I’m sure you can do the C/S/DC method with any products from any company but if you’re someone like me that has super dry, brittle hair with low porosity and breaks off easily I’d recommend these from Shea Moisture!! And the manukau honey set smells AMAZING too and the scent lasts which is a plus!!! I’m super excited now I feel like my hair is really going to start growing and getting stronger now I’ll be sure to update if anything changes !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

I was looking for a conditioner that would help with dry hair and scalp and this is a game changer.  I have really long locs and lately they have been dry even after conditioning.  The first time I used SheaMoisture's conditioner, I noticed an immediate change in my hair.  My locs are soft, easy to manage and my scalp even feels moisturized!  The icing on the cake is that this conditioner smells like heaven.  I'm not even exaggerating.  I couldn't stop sniffing my hands as I put it in my hair and my hair still smelled great after a few days.  I highly recommend this for women with locs and other natural hair styles."

Le démêlage n'est plus une galère, et presque un moment de détente, si on ajoute à ça un petit massage du crâne !MERCI !Shea moisture est une marque qui a su se créer une place dans le milieu assez fermé des produits capilaires principalement destinés aux possesseurs de cheveux crépus/bouclés, connus pour être les plus difficiles à maintenir. Ce produit leur rend absolument honneur et respecte l'image de la marque qui se veut respectueuse du cheveux et transparente.Et en plus de ça, une partie des revenus de la marque vont pour soutenir des associations qui luttent contre la pauvreté, et aider des petits business.

506,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,Don’t buy this. Firstly it smells awful as your hair is drying. Secondly it didn’t hydrate my hair at all - in fact it caused so much drying out and breakage I’ve had to have 6 inches cut off.

Habe lockiges Haar und wende die Curlygirl Methode an. Als Co-Wash habe ich jetzt den hier ausprobiert und bin begeistert. Ich brauche nicht viel, er entwirrt meine Haare, der Duft gefällt mir bisher, von den getesteten, am besten. Wenn das so bleibt, dann habe ich endlich den richtigen Conditioner für mich."
520,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Of course I read the reviews and most of them were positive. I already tried their deep conditioning hair mask (which I bought from Amazon) and LOVED it! So I decided to buy the shampoo and conditioner. I have 3b curly hair. This conditioner left my hair greasy because it's very thick and very difficult to completely rinse out. It also weighted my hair down and made it impossible for my styling products to get absorbed, so it's been sitting on my hair until I washed it with clarifying shampoo.  It also didn't help with the frizz. I do not recommend it and certainly regret the high price I paid to get it quickly!"

Antes de comprarlo había escuchado que era malisimo, asi que no puedo culpar a nadie porque las reseñas eran ciertas y yo me empeñe en comprarlo. No hidrata, de hecho a medida que lo pones en el pelo este se va poniendo duro, con lo cual tienes que  aclarar y utilizar cualquier otro que sea muy hidratante para poder solucionar el estropicio.NO LO RECOMIENDO."

If you have curly hair then you’ve found the holy grail of curly or dry hair products. Pick any and you will fall in love with them after first use. I certainly did. Biggest challenge I’ve found is trying to buy them from Priceline or similar in store is they are always sold out or awaiting stock (which drives me crazy lol). So now I just order here on Amazon from I think they’re called hair and beauty mega store? Anyway, enjoy the products, you’re in good hands."
523,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"The ingredients listed are not accurate.  See the photo of the bottle I received. It contains limonene which was not listed on Amazon as an ingredient and the photo in the listing has a different ingredient list.  I am allergic to citrus so I cannot eat citrus or have it in my body products.  No limonene, citronellol,  geraniol, etc. It gives me a terrible, red, itchy rash.  This is why I check the ingredients of everything I buy because these substances are in practically everything from deodorant, body wash, laundry detergent, shampoo, etc.  I bought this conditioner after carefully reading the ingredients and then when I received the product, the ingredients were different. I did not notice until after I used it and broke out in a rash. Then I checked the bottle and there it was! Limonene!"

Das stimmt schon für den Artikel den ich geliefert bekommen habe, jedoch nicht für die angegebenen Bestandteile durch Amazon. Wenn ich wüsste das ""Fragrance"" an dritter Stelle in der Liste mit Bestandteilen steht, hätte ich den Conditioner gar nicht bestellt...vor allem gibt es in diesem Produkt mehr Parfüm als den Hauptbrstandteil mit dem die Marke vermarktet wird Shea Butter.Ich kann das kaum fassen... und sowas nicht anzugeben ist einfach eine Frechheit!"

535,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Edit: Bought the mafura oil conditioner a second time, 2 bottles this time. Have not used the new bottles yet. One of the bottles was not sealed properly and some of the conditioner spilled out into the box, a lot more than the first time (see 3rd picture). The other two products seem fine.Bought this conditioner along with the other two products pictured. These do seem authentic. The manuka honey and mafura oil conditioner smells AMAZING, which I unfortunately could smell upon opening the box because, as pictured, it spilled out. The product itself works quite well for my dry wavy hair and makes my hair smell really good all day.  Need quite a lot of product as the consistency is quite thin compared to some other conditioners. It does seem to absorb well into my hair although some reviews have mentioned that it is hard to wash out."

587,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"I have heard a lot of good things about Shea Moisture so decided to dip my toe in the water and change up my routine. I can happily report that I'm glad I did! I have mixed race wavy grade hair and decided that the ingredients would lend this to be an effective leave in, I saw no reason to wash it out. Firstly on opening the bottle I was pleased by the smell, it's gorgeous without being overly cloying. If you're a honey fan like me it's a definite keeper! The slip is good whilst massaging into the scalp and roots, and I have lots of bounce and shine after allowing my hair to naturally air dry. I paired my conditioner with a Shea Moisture shampoo and do believe I will continue with this brand for a while so I'm very glad I found it. My strands feel hydrated from scalp to tip, and my curls last for several days. I can easily detangle my hair with my fingers to keep my hair from breaking, and I have seen great results using this as my regular co wash product every other week."

608,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil deep moisturizing conditioner 24oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,This has a light pleasant scent and effectively detangles my hair in the shower (I use a tangle teaser in the shower and my fingers once I get out). The only issue I have with it is that it's not very thick - I'm used to using lots of extremely thick conditioner. This is not like that and it makes it a little difficult to tell if I've used enough.I use about five pumps for each half of my hair and then secure it inside a shower cap while I wash the rest of my body before rinsing it off.

I will definitely recommend this product!"

Now that I'm transitioning to natural from relaxed(4c), moisture is key! My hair feels so much softer immediately after putting this product in my hair.I also love the smell. It doesn't smell like shea butter, which was important for me. The scent also lingers lightly even after I rinse it out, which is nice.I think this product will last for a while, seeing as it only takes two or three pumps to get through my shoulder-length locks.Definitely a must-try!"

1,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps to revive dyed and burned hair.,This product was a lifesaver for my dyed and burned hair!
2,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic regular 3-5 minute conditioner,"I have natural 4b hair. Unlike the deep conditioner version, this version makes my hair feel so soft and moisturized. After rinsing out I have unbelievable curls, definition and shine. Its weird that the deep conditioner version doesnt work as welll. Would recommend buying this regular conditioner version. I use it with every wash day."
3,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware amazon products aren’t always Genuine!! I have had some that are great and others not!,"I’ve bought a few of these off Amazon, I have long hair and need a new bottle about every 4 weeks.The product I received this last time  was sub par.  My hair is soo dry, i kept adding more and more and it wasn’t working to condition my hair. I ended up using a product that isn’t as “heavy” and had better results.Shea Moisture manuka Honey is a Amazing Product, but sometimes you’re not getting what your buying."
4,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,good price but smell is overwhelming and causes allergy,I love Shea Moisture products and can generally tolerate smell but this was so over-the-top strong smelling that I returned it.  It also caused itching and allergy.Thank you Amazon for your great return policy!
5,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't rinse out,"This conditioner was so difficult to wash out. It took forever to rinse me hair and it felt like unless I stood under the water for 15 minutes rinsing, then it left a residue. I definitely will not buy it again."
6,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Most Moisturizing Hair Conditioner Ever,"The packaging is very nice. The colors made me feel a sense of peace and harmony. I like the colors so much.  It’s easy to use and easy to hold.  I like that it had a pump because usually the jar conditioners get water in them from the shower, but the pump keeps the conditioner un- diluted and when I  finish with the conditioner,  I  turn the spout closed to keep the conditioner fresh and free of air. I Love the scent;  vanilla - honey. I love the ingredients. The texture-consistency is thick. I have  a combination of 2c-3a-c hair andSheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Conditioner melted into my hair. It was a great experience.  It has slip and 3 minutes after  applying it to pre-sectioned hair,  I finger detangled and kept it in my hair until I finished my shower. The conditioner left my skin hydrated too. I Love this conditioner and will buy again. Definitely going to recommend."

9,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,THE SMELLLL 😳,"I’m African American with relaxed hair and I have to say this product has gave my hair a lot more moisture! The back of my head is always the driest so I’m not surprised that it’s still kind of dry back there, but the rest of my hair felt soft and moisturized. T H E  S M E L L I S  S O  N I C E, I don't even know how else to describe it! This product also made my hands very soft but beware, I received it in the mail and it kept spilling from the top so I had to wipe it down like 3 times and also because of this virus going around. After i wiped it I topped it up real tight and the problem was solved! I ordered another and these things ship really fast, the first one arrived really quick. I'm still stuck on the smell though, its so good and i will continue to use this on my hair."
10,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I was a skeptic but I really like this on my black dry hair,"I'm a black guy and never really thought about using anything in my hair, since I usually cut my hair low. But decided to grow it out this year to a little fro. So of course, now I notice my hair is dry and coarse and leaves me with dry scalp. That changed when my wife told me to get something for my hair.Decided to start with this conditioner after reading the reviews and after 2 times using it, my hair is noticeably softer, easier to manage (pick and comb) and no more dry scalp or tangles in the hair.This may have different results for other people but from going to using NOTHING in my hair for 30 years to using this, it is a HUGE improvement. I will be getting their hydrating shampoo next to test that out."
11,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best conditioner I have ever used!,"I have naturally curly hair. Maybe 2C or 3A/3B, I don't know. I could never figure it out. It's dry, it's frizzy. It's thick, long, curly hair. I use a wet brush in the shower after putting in this conditioner, and it's like a magic elixir. Knots slip away. And it's not like a detangler....no. It doesn't feel slippery(or somehow dry) at all like that. I've been using it for about a year and it has transformed my hair. So much less frizz. I don't even use a frizz product anymore. I use a little of this as a leave in. In fact, I only barely wash it out when I wash my hair. On days I don't wash my hair, I wet it a bit and add a few pumps of this conditioner.  I have no more breakage and my hair is super soft and smells divine. All this PLUS it's not tested on animals (very important to me) nor does it have harmful chemicals. And they give to charitable causes.I will use this forever if possible!"
12,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for long straight hair prone to tangle,"With all the high reviews, I wanted to like this conditioner, but it did nothing to condition my very long straight hair that is prone to get tangled.  Perhaps this would be good for someone with a different type of hair, but for me it was a big waste of money as I still needed other conditioning products afterwards to actually condition and detangle my hair.  Plus I thought it smelled strange, like some kind of patchouli or musky smell, not what I want my clean hair to smell like."
13,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells fantastic,"This stuff smells amazing and, true to its word, makes my hair crazy soft. I have to use T-Sal shampoo for a scalp condition, which dries my hair out to straw, and this counteracts that in a way a lot of other conditioners don't.I will say that I use a ton of this every time because it doesn't lather and seems to kind of disappear as I try to work it into my hair ... it's about the consistency of hand lotion so in thick or long hair a little bit doesn't seem to go far. Also I have 2c/3a curly hair and while this seems to prevent frizz, it loosens the curls up instead of defining them, so they have about half the volume I'm used to. Could be a good thing, depending on your hair type; for me it means I use an additional product to get the shape back.Seriously, though, I'd buy it for the smell."
14,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hair softer than it has been in months.,"So I have dry damaged hair that needs some love. I've tried various products and none of quite delivered. I need a few more dollars for free shipping and this had high reviews so I tried it out.I just got it today so here is my first impression.The smell is good but super strong. If they halved the smell it would be perfect.I just got my hair wet in the shower and applied root to tip. I Saturday every strand and put a shower cap on. Lefted on for 20 minutes and rinsed with cold water. I then took a small pump and worked it into my damp hair as a leave in.Now nothing is a miracle conditioner so my hair still isn't the best, however it feels better than it has in a couple months. I'll keep using it and update how my hair feels after I finish my first bottle"
15,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle and pump need improvement,"Love everything about this product and other similar conditioners from this company... except the pumps. I’ve bought this and others several times and I always have to take off the pump and dispense without it when I’m barely halfway through using the bottle. It’s like the pump won’t support the thickness of the product. A squeeze bottle with cap would work much more effectively. In fact, I took a cap from another bottle (I believe a shampoo) and it worked perfectly up until the end. Improve the packaging and this would be a perfect product."
16,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,It smells nice and my natural hair was soft and manageable after ...,It smells nice and my natural hair was soft and manageable after using but it also caused some minor itching and irritation.
17,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best,I won’t buy any other shampoo. Since using this for a month less frizz my hair looks healthier feels soft and for the 1st time since I’ve decided to grow my hair out I love my hair. I have thick hair. With both shampoo & conditioner I can tame my crazy hair. Best part it’s not dried out and more. It has took a month to see a difference but wow. I’ve always hated my hair. Not now. Shampoo does make a difference and how u use it. I highly recommend

It smells like something...at least one of the ingredients has gone putridly BAD. I still tried to use it, followed by another better smelling conditioner, but I'm not sure it even works well anymore."
19,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Helped my damaged hair,Wasn’t expecting to like this conditioner as much as I do! My son sat next to me and asked me what smelled good and it was my hair lol Also my husband is super sensitive to scents and usually hates all the perfumes and body washes I get but he liked this. Before I got in the shower my hair was a bit tangly and afterward it got all the tangles out just from conditioning it. Definitely hooked me with that.
20,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,From Desert to Rainforest.,"I had been using a co-wash (I won't name it) that I'd thought to be good. It made my hair look and feel great the day of, and day after washing. However, I began to notice after those two days, my hair and scalp were dry. Sahara desert dry. I'd oil my scalp and the dryness would ensue.I needed a change. I decided, after remembering success with previous She Moisture products, to give this line a try: It changed my life.My hair went from parched to lush. My curls are more defined. My follicles are silky and strengthened. The shine factor is on 100 (People have been asking me if I had my hair dyed).Suffice it to say, this will be my go-to line of hair products. It works for me. The price is right. And it smells amazing."
21,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these products,"I have used many of Shea's products and none of them have disappointed me. I utilize their leave in conditioners as well as the ones you rinse out. I have curly hair that tends to get frizzy easily. My only dislike is this pump bottle. When the product is almost finished, it is difficult to retrieve the bottom contents. I end up having to take the pump off and bang the bottle or add water and use the rest. Same issue with their body lotions. They are thick and well made but difficult to retrieve from the bottles."
22,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure if it the true product,"I’ve bought this product several times from Sally’s and Walmart, however due to the coronavirus I’ve not been out so I bought this online. It doesn’t smell the same or feel the same at all! I really hope it’s the true product as I STRICTLY follow the curly girl method and do not put products in my hair that’s not curly girl approved"
23,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Softens, Moisturizes The Co. donates 10%  to Community Commerce",It has a nice honey smell.  It's color safe. The only thing I didn't like was the way it arrived. It should have been wrapped in bubble wrap or a bubble pouch. The top push dispenser arrived broken off because they just threw the item in the box it seems. Fortunately it didn't leak or spill and all of the contents are there. When I use it I will just have to remove the cap which is not a big problem or anything.  13 ounces for under $10 so this will last for some time. Overall I am happy with the product and this purchase.
24,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, definitely ""conditions"" but sticks to my hair like none other...","I really want to like this conditioner, and for reference I have 3A curls, but for whatever reason this product weighs super heavy on my hair. Not only that but it makes my curl pattern extra strange and seperate more in a weird way so they are thinner vs thicker by the end of the day. My biggest grip would be the leftover residue after a shower. It's as if I had put in a leave-in but instead of softness it has more of a waxy feel.I'd imagine this product works well for someone with very very fine and dry hair. I personally have very thick, not to dry strands which may be why this didn't work for me. The smell is great and it feels good to put in my hair and detangle during the shower but thats it..."

The scent is subtle and so wonderful. I once used use a cheap shampoo and my hair felt sooooo dry and stripped so I decided to give this conditioner a try and oh my words it’s the best decision I’ve ever made. It melted into my strands and immediately my hair felt so moisturized and looked healthy and shiny. I love love love this conditioner and the hair mask in this line is heaven sent as well. Don’t second guess just purchase ! You won’t regret it !
26,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy,"This smells fantastic, but unfortunately no amount of rinsing worked to get it out, I rinsed for about 3 minutes the second time I used it and it still left my hair greasy and gross, it even made it shed out way more than normal. My daughter had the same problems. Thankfully they refunded me no problem."
27,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,This product has protein in it!,"I have 3C/4A high porosity virgin hair and I follow the curly girl method. I was not aware that this had protein in it. I used it right before I did a protein treatment and one side of my hair came out crunchy. Luckily, I noticed and performed two deep condition treatments to fix the issue. I would not recommend this product to individuals who have hair like mine."
28,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's really thin, about the consistency of cheap lotion",I only bought this because it was recommended as a beard co-wash by one of my favorite Youtubers and i regret spending the $7 lol. It's really think so idk if it's counterfeit but i do know that most Shea moisture products i'm familiar with seem to have a thicker consistency. I'm bout the whole She Moisture Men's beard line and a lotion and them were all thick and had a weight to them. This product is very thin and has no real moisturizing or conditioning properties. You're better off either buying it from a real store or going trying a different product altogether.
29,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have coarse & dry hair, this conditioner won’t cut it","I have coarse, wavy Asian hair that has been chemically processed (balayage and dyed). My hair is pretty dry and I had high hopes for this conditioner, but it was pretty disappointing. It was thin and not very moisturizing. I used about 2 big handfuls to cover my hair and I had to add a different conditioner, because it just wasn’t cutting it. Smells lovely though!"

Ive been searching for an amazing conditioner for so long ! This is it, this conditioner changed the game for me ! I use this conditioner with this type of shampoo, hair masque, and use curl cream and Dippity Doo gel :) i have good hair days now :’) I used to be insecure of my birds nest looking for the right products to use !"
31,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells lovely!,"My favorite thing about this conditioner is the smell. There are lots of great conditioners out there but what makes this one distinctive is its wonderful scent. It even lingers throughout the day after you have rinsed it off (which some people may or may not want in a conditioner). In addition to the scent, it makes my hair smooth but not greasy looking. My hair definitely feels healthy and full after using it.Update: The dispenser on the conditioner broke after about a week. This is the second time that it's happened with this product (I assumed the first time was a fluke). It doesn't bother me too much--it's easy to just take the cap off and use it that way but it is worth noting. Still a great conditioner though."
32,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Crunchy Hair,"I tried this and the paired shampoo as a high moisture shampoo/conditioner as a replacement for the Devacurl Decadence line (made my scalp itchy). I have high porosity, 3b/3c curls that need a lot of moisture, so I thought for sure that this ""intensive hydration"" combo would be a good fit. Not the case, unfortunately. After the first use, my hair is crunchy, dry, and rough. Really bummed, but will be looking for other products."
33,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Love Love!,Smell is amazing and so are my results. You only need a little of this amazing stuff. I’ve been natural for 8 years and since I’ve been using Shea Moisture Products my hair has responded completely different in terms of moisture and growth. This works especially well for those of us that suffer from dry hair (a lot of natural women do) Try it and see for yourself. Love this stuff!
34,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Is it the glycerin?,"I don't know what it is about my hair and Shea Moisture, but the brand does not work for me (with one exception). I have fine, color-treated, long 3A curls, and I co-wash. This was too heavy and left my hair both greasy and frizzy. I had a similar problem with the much-recommended coconut-hibiscus line. In contrast, the JBCO leave-in does work for me. In short, fine-haired curlies look elsewhere."
35,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stinks,"The smell. Horrible! The most strongest perfume scented conditioner I've ever used. I bought it to use on my daughter's ethnic curls and the smell lasts for DAYS. Even others have made comments, like, ""what is in her hair, that's so strong!"" I make sure to rinse it really well, but it doesn't help."
36,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite so far.,"Light conditioner, not hard to coat hair. I ring out my hair after shampooing and let it sit for a few minutes to ensure the conditioner is used efficiently because its more on the pricy side. I loved how my hair felt and looked afterwards. Accentuated the texture in my hair, no frizz and not weighted down. The bottle did leak a bit in shipping."
37,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a conditioner I like!,"I've recently gotten into using conditioners without sulfates, parabens, phthalates, or dimethicone and this one is great. It smells like honey and it made my hair feel so nice and soft and my hair smells fantastic. This conditioner is pretty light in consistency but you don't need much to get the benefits. I have long natural blonde curly/wavy dry hair and this worked great for me."
38,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like this conditioner,"I bought this product along with the shampoo and I really like it. It smells very good and moisturizes my strands. I have about 3a-3b hair and it works really well! The only issue I have with this conditioner is how much I find myself using. The consistency is very thin and I find myself using multiple pumps to get my hair to the softness I want. The scent is also pleasant, I really enjoy it but for some it may be a bit strong. This scent’s intensity can be easily overcome by a leave in conditioner or a leave in hair oil though. Overall, would recommend buying."
39,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not moisturizing!,"When I bought this product it said it was ultra hydrating and moisturizing.. that is not the case. The product itself is really thin, not something I would typically describe a moisturizing conditioner to be. Along with it being a very thin product, I don’t think it’s very moisturizing at all. I put about 4 pumps of product onto my hair, and it felt like almost nothing was there. I’m sad to say that I didn’t enjoy this product, because I love Shea Moisture products"
40,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Dissatisfied...,This product has the Honey as 14th ingredient and it only says Honey and not Manuka Honey. The package came open and I got half of the product in the bottle. Besides those two things is a good product for now... I honestly thought it had better ingredients.
41,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Results,"This stuff, in combination with Shea Moisture Bamboo Charcoal Deep Cleansing Shampoo works very well. My hair is very thick and coarse and I had some dandruff going on before I used these two products.  Dandruff is gone, my hair has never been this soft and easy to comb. Even when my hair has dirty build-up, the shampoo always lathers up the first time. I highly recommend these two products. Two thumbs up to Shea Moisture. Oh, I am a middle aged black man."
42,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Loving it but arrived just half of it,"I love the product but only half of it arrived. Awful package (no protection). It's my holy grail but seriously, why would you send a fluid product like that?Previous review: I have a 3B low porosity hair and I'm actually using this as a leave-in conditioner. The smell is quite peculiar but after a bit, you just get used to it and I really like it, it leaves my hair bouncy with just scrunching. The only downside is that if I leave my hair just with this product for more than two days it starts to look greasy but, anyway, it's not designed to be used a leave in. It just takes really good care of my hair so as a conditioner or even to use as deep conditioner (use a plastic cap and leave it all night) it's just amazing!"

44,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was hoping for,"I think I must be slightly allergic to something in this, it burns when it touches my scalp. I bought this thinking it'd be good to rehydrate my hair after swimming... it's actually worse than my regular conditioner. My hair is frizzier and crispier."
45,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Quick review,"I’ve stopped using product because of its thickness.  If you have low porosity  hair you can mix it with water which will help. However, it’s too much work doing it all the time."
46,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is everything,"I had a bad reaction to coconut when I used this the first time. Turns out it was the hair oil I used along with this with coconut as the first ingredient.  I have natural hair and this stuff was AMAZING.  I bought two sets of shampoo and condition because it was a great price.  GET THIS if you have a sensitivity to coconut, but you want to get something that will make your hair feel and smell amazing!"

Looking at the product, I thought it had all the natural ingredients.  Somehow the scent was very strong, too strong for no reasons.  If you are sensitive to strong fragrance, I would not recommend this.  It made me a little sick."
48,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Scent is TOO Overpowering, very disappointed.",We are a family that enjoys using Shea moisture products. We tried this conditioner and no one in our family likes it. The scent is SO strong!! 😳 If you read in the ingredients it just says ‘fragrance (essential oil blend)’ as one of the first few ingredients. This is a big disappointment to us as it’s overpowering and triggers my allergies. Will not be purchasing and/or recommending.

52,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best conditioner ever!,I bought this along with the shampoo and leave in conditioner of the same scent. This conditioner is AMAZING! My hair was so moisturized and easy to manage and I had zero tangles. My hair was so easy to part and blow dry. I usually go to the salon but because of the weather I had to do it at home. I can’t wait for the next 3 weeks when I have to do my hair again. If you’re on the fence don’t hesitate. Buy it!
53,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work well,Did not work well. Smells amazing but the masque works better. This conditioner did not hydrate at all (it was used on two hair types 2b and 3b both untreated/not dyed).

58,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing but,"For some reason it treats my hair very well.

I am not certain of the scent, but it strikes me as smelling strongly of ""sandalwood""...?It had an overwhelming perfume smell that only subsides a bit with rinsing/drying.  I was super excited to try It due to the positive reviews and am disappointed that it is unusable for me because of the scent."

Yes others work better but no other “clean” or well rated conditioners work this well. I used to use live clean brand until I found they aren’t as “clean” as they claim to be.

71,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best conditioner I have ever used,The difference this conditioner made in my hair has been miraculous. My hair went from continually being dried out every day to being softer and holding in more moisture than ever before. I even had people notice the difference in the feel of my hair. I'll continue to use this for awhile.
72,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,I reallt like the moisture and softness I get with this product.

73,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s alright,LOVE the smell of this conditioner. I can smell it on my hair for almost 2 days straight. Just wish the conditioner was more moisturizing. I have very fine silky healthy hair and this still isn’t enough for my liking. Leaves my hair super tangled  and it’s super hard to brush after I get out of the shower. My hair was way easier to brush when using my old conditioner. Feel like if you have super dry damaged hair you might want to try a different conditioner.

As I'm typing this, I can't wait to wash this stuff out of my hair. I didn't use much at all. It is way too strong! My daughter got in our pickup and asked what that perfume smell was. She said several times during our drive that it was way too strong.I do think some people would really like it. My hair feels great, soft and full of body. And my curls are curly, not frizzy."

80,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Mild bad fragrance,It does a good job moisturizing but the smell is awful. It's a mild smell that gives you a headache over time. I wish they had not added fragrance. I like another one of their conditioners better because of the smell.

86,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very smelly,"Product picture is misleading, as the bottle does not have a pump. My biggest complaint is the scent, which is extremely potent. I have very short hair and can smell it through the day which is unfortunate. It would be ok if it smelled good."

93,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Leaks👎,The product is amazing. Makes my hair 10x softer. Smells sweet like honey maybe. The only problem I had was these people clearly don’t know how to wrap stuff up so it doesn't leak/ open. They sent me a free one (because the first one i got leaked all over the place). The second one also leaked all over the place.
94,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stiff where? Here.,Left my hair feeling stiff and unworkable. Did nothing for knots. My hair is thin and this left it looking stringy... not a great look IMO
95,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product ever!!!!!!,"Made my hair really brittle,dry and knotted up!!!!! I had to pay money for a hair dresser and have my hair cut...... And I had a wedding to be in and had to spend extra money due to this horrid product!!!!!!"
96,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Generously moisturizing for curls,I think this is a great product. However I bought it for my daughter and I to try and I think it was not the appropriate product for our curl type. Our curls range from type 2a-3b and this product was too heavy and just weighed them down. Would definitely recommend for curl types 3c and up.
97,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing,"Love the scent! Does a great job moisturizing my dry, curly, dyed hair. Recommend-especially since made with organic ingredients."
98,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,SOFTER HAIR,This really has helped and changed the texture of my hair and made it much softer after bleaching for the first time a few months ago. The smell is a little off to me when i first apply it but it smells fine after its washed of and dry.
99,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn’t buy again,"I have dense low porosity 4B curls, didn’t do much after deep conditioning with a cap. I wouldn’t recommend my hair was left dry."
100,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a moisturizing as I hoped,I do not see the moisturizing/hydration benefits of this conditioner. I put a good amount of it in my hair and I always feel like I need to add more and my hair still feels dry. I can’t wait for it to finish.
101,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great slippage,"In the shower, after shampooing, I work this through my hair. Then after I wash my body, I begin to comb my hair and the tangles are minimal and my hair is the most TANGLY TANGLES in knots without this product."
102,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,I love this product. I am a African American male maintaining a fro and have a very dry scalp and head naturally. This product is a great moisturizer! I do leave the moisturizer on my head for about 15 min though even though it’s says 3. Seems to be a little more efficient with results( especially if you have thick hair and live in a humid area) if it sets for a little bit.
103,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,"I’ve tried a couple other Shea moisture products but this by far has been the worst of them.

105,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Need to package better for shipping,"The product itself is great. Unfortunately, the top was not secured and about 1/3 of the bottle leaked all over the other items in the box. Previous orders had always had tge top secured or the entire bottle enclosed in a bag."
106,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!!,"Best conditioner I've ever used!

116,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,This is not a Leave-in Conditioner. STOP PUTTING Regular Conditioner in the category,This came up in the leave in conditioner section so it was ordered this in fact is not a leave in conditioner so something in Amazon's algorithm as well as the customer vendor needs to be changed so people can stop ordering a bunch of conditioner they don't need.

I have never really found a product that isn't bought in a salon for $$$$ that works to tame my mane.  A few years ago, I started looking into these products I was using. Everything from hair care, to skin and face care, to what I was eating, soap, toothpaste, and found that many of these products were poisoning me.  Well, I started to switch out my products, but it has taken me 3 YEARS to finally find this beautiful product.  It works even better than any of the old salon products I have used to moisturize and add shine to my hair (Tame the mane!), and unfortunately, much better than any other comparatively natural products I have tried up until this point. The waitress at the local diner that I frequent even commented that my hair looked healthy! (YAY!) Anyways, I'm going to quit ranting, but I can't say enough good things about this product, and for the price, it's a steal. Try it,  you won't regret it."

390,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Love Love It!,"Absolutely the best natural conditioner I've ever used... I have thick, fine to medium, color treated Caucasian hair that has a slight wave to it. I've moved away from shampoos/conditioners that have sulfates and silicones as silicones will coat the hair shaft and keep moisture out. You can slather your hair with any moisturizer/oil but if the hair shaft is covered in silicone, it won't penetrate. I use the Shea Moisture Retention shampoo and follow with the Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Conditioner; which I leave on for a few minutes in the shower. I find it has plenty of slip (for a non-silicone product) and the scent is FABULOUS. My hair is shiny, healthy and full of body - and did I mention the fabulous scent?? I loved the smell so much I bought the Manuka Honey & Mafura bar soap at my local Fred Meyer store, which actually moisturized better than the Olay body wash I'd been using, without the harsh sulfates and chemicals. Totally love this line :)"

416,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for THICK curly hair! Must try!,"I've been using this conditioner for years prior to buying it on amazon (cheaper than Target). But I went to the reviews, and noticed that they do not do this product justice at all; so I wanted to leave an informative review! This conditioner is thick and hydrating; you want to make sure your hair is very wet when applying to create slip which allows for easy detangling (I use a spray bottle). It is great to pair with an oil - I detangle with just the conditioner and add coconut oil on my shaft and scalp afterwards to seal the moisture. Then you would want to let it sit in your hair for over 30 minutes (I understand the bottle says otherwise, and you don't reap the benefits in 3-5 minutes). I usually let mines sit in my hair overnight in a plastic cap (or at least 30 min. if I'm in a hurry). Note, a plastic cap or sitting under a dryer allows the product to penetrate the follicles even further; leaving your hair silky soft.  Before you know it, your hair will be revitalized! This is perfect when coming from protective styles and from straightening your hair; but this is my every week conditioner! I have kinky curly thick wavy curls (hard to describe I think ima a 3C/4A mix) - I actually don’t like the deep masque conditioner but this one I def recommend for 3/4 hair types. As a former product junky, I hope this helped someone!"

419,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy grail for low porosity hair,"I took care of my hair. Didn't dye it, used sulfate-free/silicone-free everything, hardly used heat on it, but one day I noticed my curls weren't what they used to be (2c, 3a). They were stretched out and limp. I tried protein treatments and ""deep conditioners"" to no prevail. I tried at least 4 different regular conditioners but none seemed to help with moisture (even the ones $30+). I finally found out that I have severely low porosity hair when I did the strand test and after an hour my hairs were still floating on top. Desperate, I tried this on a whim. I've tried other Shea Moisture products before and liked them, but never found a conditioner I loved. Enter this stuff. I paired it with their almond oil (I leave on overnight from scalp to ends then wash the next day) and my hair has transformed from broken, snapped strands and dry limp frizz, into silky strands with strength. I can't stop touching it! Those two products are the only items that have actually penetrated my low porosity hair and I'm crazy grateful to feel normal again. My curls are back and bouncy! (The almond oil has made my hair and eyebrows grow like crazy too.)"

It does what it says on the bottle. It conditions hair and leaves it feeling soft and manageable after washing. It feels like a light lotion and provides enough slip (well at least for me, straight hair) to detangle. My favorite aspect of this conditioner is that it rinses fast, easily, and cleanly. I hate heavy conditioners that leave residue and weigh me down. It also smells really good, like honeyed syrup. My hair is less frizzy after washing it, I will probably buy more for my mum and me."
423,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Ingredients but not worth the money,I have super dry hair and tried the conditioner which didn’t seem to help much.

424,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture rich detangling,"I love this conditioner  and the shampoo for that matter. For the first time, while natural (nearly 4 years now), I've found a product that adequately hydrates AND detangles my dense, 4c hair. Combing through it is a cinch. Blow drying is too. The smell, I love it. I know a few have said its a bit much but I think that is a preference thing. I am pretty discriminating when it comes to scent and the strength thereof and find the smell to be highly tolerable but then again, preference. Glad I gave it a try."

Also, it's pretty fast acting in that you don't have to leave it on for longer than 5-10 minutes. It gives the illusion of being soft and able to maintain, but I feel that it could be a bit better at actually HYDRATING  the hair. So in conclusion, I would recommend this product if your hair already has great moisture retention and just needs a boost here and there. But if you need more than a boost, don't waste your money!"

It smells great, and leaves my hair moisturized, soft, strengthened, and luscious. I wouldn't say this is a conditioner with great 'slip,' necessarily, but the fact that my hair is so soft after rinsing it out makes up for it. I follow up with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave in conditioner to detangle, and then I'm good to go."

I used my waver and the shine was amazing. It also smells really nice and it doesn't fade out fast. My hair normally is easy to make greasy, even though it's very very dry, but this product just makes my hair incredible, it's outright transforming how much nice my hair looks and feels when I use this. My only complaint is that the shampoo doesn't really lather, I'm used to lather. I keep recommending it to other women with bleached hair, that's how much I love it."

The other one I like is the Coconut Hibiscus conditioner. They both detangle the best for me and have the best scent in my opinion.

My hair is color treated and I also use heated styling tools several times a week so dryness is always an issue.  This conditioner hydrates really well, leaving my hair soft and shiny.  It also has a lot of ""slip"" so detangling is easy and it smells like wildflower honey!  It's really rich and thick and I've found that leaving it on for about 5 minutes helps it work even better.  I also use the Manuka Honey shampoo, which is sulfate free and therefore color safe.  It lathers really well and is very moisturizing.  When I use these two products, my hair is very smooth and soft and very manageable.  I've been using them for about a month and definitely notice a big difference.  My hair is very healthy looking now and super shiny and frizz free.  These products have done wonders for my dry, lifeless tresses.  I definitely recommend them both.  However, you can purchase them at Ulta or Target for $10-$11 apiece, so don't pay the outrageous Amazon price!"

I was hesitant but it was definitely worth it.,I am so glad I got this. I've heard so many good things about this product but after trying their virgin coconut oil line (horrid) I was a little worried. (The picture is of my ends right after I woke up the next day)Pros:-smells FANTASTIC like a beautiful sweet fruit herb garden-Very thick and moisturizing just how I like my conditioners-Makes my hair curlier (2c-3a)-Makes my hair smooth and less frizzy-lightweight yet very lucious-Makes me happyCons:-there's less in the bottle than you would think. It starts like an inch below the top and isn't very densly packed so I imagine with my very long hair it will go by fast unless I suppliment with another conditioner.-Bottle is plastic (bad for the environment and hard to dispose) it would be great if it was 100% recycled plastic but I couldn't find anything like that. (Maybe I just didn't check the bottle well enough) I understand other alternatives would probably make it expensive and out of my price range though.

483,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved my hair ❤️,"The whole Manukau honey set (the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner) did WONDERS for my hair! I saw this method on TikTok where you condition your hair first, shampoo, and then deep condition (I’ll abbreviate it as the C/S/DC method 😜) and BABY let me tell you… my hair has never felt softer and more moisturized! I was a little skeptical at first but now I HIGHLY recommend it if you have dry, low porosity, brittle hair that breaks easily! I used to have TERRIBLE breakage! I mean like losing 3-5 HANDFULS of hair no matter WHAT I did! I’ve tried several different shampoos, conditioners, and deep conditioners… many different oils, I’ve tried finger detangling… I get regular trims from a licensed hairstylist but NOTHING would help with the breakage but baby… doing the C/S/DC method with these products has reduced my breakage GREATLY! In the pic is the amount of hair I’ve lost from START to FINISH!!! Just a palm full!!! My hair has never felt softer and so moisturized and hydrated!!!! I cannot believe that method with these products reduced my hair breakage that much!!!!!!! I’m sure you can do the C/S/DC method with any products from any company but if you’re someone like me that has super dry, brittle hair with low porosity and breaks off easily I’d recommend these from Shea Moisture!! And the manukau honey set smells AMAZING too and the scent lasts which is a plus!!! I’m super excited now I feel like my hair is really going to start growing and getting stronger now I’ll be sure to update if anything changes !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

Even if I was twiceIt doesn’t take moisture out of my locks. This is some kind of special! The condition pairs obv really well and leaves my hair perfectly soft, smelling good, over all I am happy with the texture after washing and that is rare.

I was looking for a conditioner that would help with dry hair and scalp and this is a game changer.  I have really long locs and lately they have been dry even after conditioning.  The first time I used SheaMoisture's conditioner, I noticed an immediate change in my hair.  My locs are soft, easy to manage and my scalp even feels moisturized!  The icing on the cake is that this conditioner smells like heaven.  I'm not even exaggerating.  I couldn't stop sniffing my hands as I put it in my hair and my hair still smelled great after a few days.  I highly recommend this for women with locs and other natural hair styles."

My hair used to knot and matt quite badly in the past but since using Shea Moisture Conditioner and Conditioning milk I have noticed a massive improvement in my hair. It adds moisture and makes my hair quite soft but at the same time has improved my curly pattern and brought life and bounce back to my hair. Buy it!!

Firstly it smells awful as your hair is drying. Secondly it didn’t hydrate my hair at all - in fact it caused so much drying out and breakage I’ve had to have 6 inches cut off.

I already tried their deep conditioning hair mask (which I bought from Amazon) and LOVED it! So I decided to buy the shampoo and conditioner. I have 3b curly hair. This conditioner left my hair greasy because it's very thick and very difficult to completely rinse out. It also weighted my hair down and made it impossible for my styling products to get absorbed, so it's been sitting on my hair until I washed it with clarifying shampoo.  It also didn't help with the frizz. I do not recommend it and certainly regret the high price I paid to get it quickly!"

Antes de comprarlo había escuchado que era malisimo, asi que no puedo culpar a nadie porque las reseñas eran ciertas y yo me empeñe en comprarlo. No hidrata, de hecho a medida que lo pones en el pelo este se va poniendo duro, con lo cual tienes que  aclarar y utilizar cualquier otro que sea muy hidratante para poder solucionar el estropicio.NO LO RECOMIENDO."

If you have curly hair then you’ve found the holy grail of curly or dry hair products. Pick any and you will fall in love with them after first use. I certainly did. Biggest challenge I’ve found is trying to buy them from Priceline or similar in store is they are always sold out or awaiting stock (which drives me crazy lol). So now I just order here on Amazon from I think they’re called hair and beauty mega store? Anyway, enjoy the products, you’re in good hands."

See the photo of the bottle I received. It contains limonene which was not listed on Amazon as an ingredient and the photo in the listing has a different ingredient list.  I am allergic to citrus so I cannot eat citrus or have it in my body products.  No limonene, citronellol,  geraniol, etc. It gives me a terrible, red, itchy rash.  This is why I check the ingredients of everything I buy because these substances are in practically everything from deodorant, body wash, laundry detergent, shampoo, etc.  I bought this conditioner after carefully reading the ingredients and then when I received the product, the ingredients were different. I did not notice until after I used it and broke out in a rash. Then I checked the bottle and there it was! Limonene!"

Have not used the new bottles yet. One of the bottles was not sealed properly and some of the conditioner spilled out into the box, a lot more than the first time (see 3rd picture). The other two products seem fine.Bought this conditioner along with the other two products pictured. These do seem authentic. The manuka honey and mafura oil conditioner smells AMAZING, which I unfortunately could smell upon opening the box because, as pictured, it spilled out. The product itself works quite well for my dry wavy hair and makes my hair smell really good all day.  Need quite a lot of product as the consistency is quite thin compared to some other conditioners. It does seem to absorb well into my hair although some reviews have mentioned that it is hard to wash out."

587,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"I have heard a lot of good things about Shea Moisture so decided to dip my toe in the water and change up my routine. I can happily report that I'm glad I did! I have mixed race wavy grade hair and decided that the ingredients would lend this to be an effective leave in, I saw no reason to wash it out. Firstly on opening the bottle I was pleased by the smell, it's gorgeous without being overly cloying. If you're a honey fan like me it's a definite keeper! The slip is good whilst massaging into the scalp and roots, and I have lots of bounce and shine after allowing my hair to naturally air dry. I paired my conditioner with a Shea Moisture shampoo and do believe I will continue with this brand for a while so I'm very glad I found it. My strands feel hydrated from scalp to tip, and my curls last for several days. I can easily detangle my hair with my fingers to keep my hair from breaking, and I have seen great results using this as my regular co wash product every other week."

608,"SheaMoisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner for Dry, Damaged Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Nourish and Soften Hair 13 oz",Size: 13 Ounce,Verified Purchase,This has a light pleasant scent and effectively detangles my hair in the shower (I use a tangle teaser in the shower and my fingers once I get out). The only issue I have with it is that it's not very thick - I'm used to using lots of extremely thick conditioner. This is not like that and it makes it a little difficult to tell if I've used enough.I use about five pumps for each half of my hair and then secure it inside a shower cap while I wash the rest of my body before rinsing it off.

Now that I'm transitioning to natural from relaxed(4c), moisture is key! My hair feels so much softer immediately after putting this product in my hair.I also love the smell. It doesn't smell like shea butter, which was important for me. The scent also lingers lightly even after I rinse it out, which is nice.I think this product will last for a while, seeing as it only takes two or three pumps to get through my shoulder-length locks.Definitely a must-try!"

0,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for 4b/4c hair maybe any hairtype,Loooove this stuff it made my dry ends so much more moisturized. I left it in for 45 minutes with a shower cap with no heat and my hair felt so great especially during this cold wintery month. Its smells sooo good too!
1,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like Honey,"Review update: It’s been about two weeks of using this and I am in love!  I have found if I use it in my hair before I step in the shower and leave it for about five minutes, then wash and condition like normal - no smell and no weighing down my curls!My hair (with the protein treatment discussed below every 6 weeks and my leave in conditioner) has been restored to all its curly soft glory!  I can’t believe how much I love this! So happy that I took a chance on this conditioner!Previous review:If I could tell you about my journey through deep conditioner it would be a book and I could tell you some things.My long hair is down to my lower back, course texture, and naturally curly (2b) dark hair. So keeping this mane moisturized is a whole thing, especially when I don't want something to weigh down my curls.I use Aphogee protein treatment first and then I am looking for the deep conditioner in between. I had to try this out after my friend recommended it.1. I loved the way was easy to put on, both thick and easy to apply, not too gooey and thick.2. It smells like Manuka Honey and that scent last, so if you're not into that don't use this. I am still very much on the fence about the smell itself because it's not in my wheelhouse, but it's something you should know if you are sensitive to fragrances.3. Jar is easy to open and close. You would think this is non issue, but when your hands are covered in conditioner and you're paying to keep water out of the pot - this matters way more than I'd like to admit.4. I let it sit for 5 minutes in a gorgeous steam shower, my hair drank it up!5. Rinsing was lovely, it wasn't hard to rinse out and didn't leave a lot of residue on my hair.I air dry after a new deep conditioner to see how it reacts with frizz. So far, I am pretty happy with this. Minimal frizz, but please note my climate is Southern California with little to no moisture in the air.I will be trying another line of conditioners in order to find another smellHappy shopping everyone!"
2,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I have 3a/3b hair and this worked wonders!! 💕,The pic of my wife does it no justice. here’s her take:I LOVE THIS MASQUE! used it as a deep conditioning treatment with my thermal hair care hot head cap and it was wonderful! Put in moisture into my hair. I sealed it with some cold water and BOOM! It's been insanely humid for some time now and my hair has been getting ball of frizz but this masque improved that greatly! My curls were moisturized and shiny. This pic is my day 4 hair and I only needed to refresh it ONCE! And I normally have to lightly refresh everyday and didn’t need to do a thing but fluff and leave. I’m very happy with this purchase! 🌸
3,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Brittle hair beware!,Be careful about how you use this product. My hair needed some moisture after a couple years of damaging color jobs. This mask seemed worth a try after lots of research. Left on my hair ends overnight for two nights.My hair came out in clumps. Actual clumps. I thought I would go bald then and there. Now I'm left with hideous hair ends from a protein overload.Make sure this is what your hair really needs!Pros:Hair was soft after useMask is great consistencySmell is great
4,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Too good to be true!,"I saw this product for such an amazing price I thought I'd order two, since it would still cost less than what I normally pay for one! I thought I was scoring a deal and was excited. Wrong. It smelled different than the one I normally buy, but it was still just as thick so I figured they had just changed the scent. After rinsing I out, it made my poor hair feel gross and waxy. I couldn't return this fast enough! Lesson learned! If it seems too good to be true, it usually IS."
5,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nourishing and lovely.,I Use many of the products. I think it’s a great line. This particular product is very nice for my 4c Hair!It is rich  enough to control the curl pattern. Yet not too greasy. I like that a lot. I alternate with this and a protein treatment every other week to balance and protect! A little goes a long way.
6,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Play dough?,"Pros: softens, thick,Cons: smells like play dough, isn’t nourishing or intensively hydrating.Conclusion: there’s way better deep conditioner by this brand just not this one."
7,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My New Go-To deep conditioner!,"This conditioner, though! I have used it twice as a once-weekly deep conditioner, and I just love my wash day look! Soft, juicy curls with great definition are actually a thing!  I have really fine, thin 3b curls and this conditioner is great! Week two looked better than week one, but that, I think, is due to a noticeable increase in moisture! I believe my hair to be fairly porous, and hadn’t regularly deep conditioned in a good while, so I am looking forward to week three! Week one, the ends of my hair kept trying do dry, so I had to keep re-wetting. This morning? The ends stayed as damp as the mid-shaft. I highly recommend this product!"
8,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great moisturizer,"I had been struggling with my daughters hair... it seemed like nothing would moisturize  it, after watching tons of videos came upon someone using this mask and decided to try it. Used it in combination with Cantu curl definer- did not rinse it off her hair I used it as a leave in. Loved it"
9,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Strips hair of moisture! Avoid at all costs!,"This product was terrible for my low porosity, high density 4a/4b curls. It had nearly no slip when I put it in but I hoped with some heat and time it would be as great as the reviews say. My hair did get soft with this, but as soon as I washed it out, I immediately felt that dry, filmy feeling coming. By the time I got out the shower, my hair was dry and tangling fast. I had excess shedding when detangling my hair after using this. Needless to say I won’t be using this again. The search for a deep conditioner continues!"
10,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Read the directions (Honest review),"I've been dying my hair since I was 13 (which was a minute ago) and that plus stripping the color can do tons of damage. Recently, I've gotten on board with getting it healthy, again. I want the weight, the elasticity, the strength of it when I pick it up and let it fall. So, I found this and it seemed fairly decent.PLEASE READ THE DIRECTIONS! When it says ""rinse out after FIVE MINUTES"" do so. DO NOT leave it in your hair for an hour or overnight, no matter how bad your hair is. You will cause more damage that way. People giving bad product reviews because they can't read directions is pretty sad. It's easy. Wash your hair, use the mask on WET hair, not dry and DO NOT leave it in for more than intended, then, rinse out. This is NOT an immediate fix but it does work. And, no, my hair is not waxy and has not fallen out in clumps."
11,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"I don't usually leave reviews, but I had to because I love this conditioner so much.I have EXTREMELY dry 4c hair. It's very picky with products. After getting to know my hair, I noticed that my hair only like products that get absorbed into the hair right away. If it leaves a coating over it, then my hair is not going to like it. It might even feel super soft for a day, but then it get extremely dry after. Even though this product is super thick (so thick that the cream stays in the jar when you flip it upside down), my hair absorbs everything and it stays super moisturized for 2-3 days after. I used this on my hair about 2 days ago. Today, I touched my hair expecting it to feel dry like always, but it felt like I just moisturized it. MIND BLOWN.It also smells AMAZING. It smells more like a fruity, sweet, and creamy perfume fragrance rather than a hair conditioner. It almost reminds me of Mon Guerlain. Literally the nicest smelling hair product I've ever used. 10/10"
12,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best conditioner I’ve ever used :),"First off, I am not associated with this brand economically nor did I receive the product in exchange for my review....This is a smooth, creamy hair moisturizer / pack. I’ve used a great many over the years and this rates second to only one other, and that one cost $45!!!My hair is very fine and thinning. Yet I can use from my scalp down. Makes hair soft and thick feeling, with no weight on my roots. Additionally  I have a regularly irritated scalp and this helps. Highest recommendation."
13,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"Great product. Colored my hair (highlights) recently and used it before and after, has been great, hardly any breakage. Love that they don't test on animals and their products are locally and ethically sourced. A percent of your purchase also goes to charity. Don't forget to recycle the tub!"
14,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Unsealed and may have been used,My product came unsealed and it looks like someone might have used a bit.
15,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about it! HIGHLY Rec. for Shiny, healthy, hair, bonus- love the fragrance.","I found this in a top 10 masque on-line review. This one rated 2 or 3, and so affordable. I needed for my silver long curly hair. Only have to use a very little. Wash hair with clarifying shampoo, rinse, apply a little to my ends only, wrap my hair in hot towel, sit for 20 min. Rinse.  The fragrance is divine and lasts for a couple days. I air dry, and the shine, the soft curls, the product gives me a healthy beautiful head of hair, and I only have to use it once a month.  I'm sure I could use with heat tools, and be protected. I'll probably use it even more often than once a month, just because I love it so much.Finally, a product that works like its high-end.. that I can afford, large quantity will last a long time."
16,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved my dry bleached hair!!!!,This is the most moisturizing deep conditioners I have ever used! The whole manuka honey & mafura oil line is incredible!!! I have bleached (highlighted blonde) hair and my hair has been so dry and damaged since..until I started using this line of products. Seriously they are SO moisturizing and saved my hair!!! This deep conditioner is the best! I use the shampoo and conditioner and after that I put this deep conditioning mask on for 5 minutes then rinse it out in the shower. I highly highly HIGHLY reccomend this and the whole line..its perfect for dry damaged hair!!! The scent is also very nice and lingers in hair. I love this product!!!!!!!!
17,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Hydration,"Update 12/27/2021: This order was shipped directly from Shea Moisture. Packaging (jars) are back to normal. It remains my 'go-to' DEEP hydration hair masque. The fragrance is pleasantly soothing yet not overwhelming with long lasting results.Update 11/11/2020: This is still an amazing moisturizing product yet my lastest conflict is the product package shipped. The jar slightly graduated to a smaller based making the label poorly wrap and bubbled. I am no chemist, yet the product appears to have the same look, feel and amazing scent. This hiccup gives me pause has to whether or not this is the actual Shea Moisture product I've ordered & used in the past or a faux product. I am considering returning.Perfect for my (sectionally mixed 3b/4ac) natural hair. Throughly moisturizes my thirsty coif. Hair remains conditioned even after hard sweaty workouts. Leaves my hair touchable with a decent sheen. The fragrance is ok yet works well with my other final product which smells terrific."
18,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shea Moisture Intensive Gets the TANGLES OUT!!!!  YAY!!,"Shea Moisture Intensive Gets the TANGLES OUT!!!!  YAY!!  I have tried all of the Shea Moisture conditioners, masks and spray detangler.... but after all of my experiments.... THIS IS THE ONE!  This one will get your tangles out, in the shower, before you go to comb out your wet matted hair.  You gotta leave it on for at least 5 minutes, and spray a little water just enough to make it work thru all the hair, don't rinse out yet.... then wait as long as you can.  Try to comb out your wet hair with a bit of water running on your head to help shake out your tangles while combing.... I have GREAT results doing it this way!  (My hair type is blonde, thin, straight, and extremely tangle-y, almost like matted spider webs.) THIS WORKS!  Highly Recommend!"
19,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,No moisturize it causes tangles,"Hair was very ,dry, and it was snags in my hair strands as I try to finger comb it!  The masque stayed on top my hair and it was stiff feeling as though it was making it about to lock into knots! The hair stuck together like snags in a nylon stocking! Also causes my hair to have breakage along with the shedding made more hair loss! I'm very disappointed and it is a waste of money!  The ingredients changed in Shea Moistures conditioners and masques that it will not work for low porosity hair! It is too thick and stiff. The only thing nice to say is it smells nice. I have to now find conditioner and shampoo with BTMS 50 which is a quaternary ammonia salt. Chemically, it has a positively charged head and is classed as a cationic. It is used as a conditioning emulsifier and will add slip and glide to hair. This will certainly help low porosity hair type."
20,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells horrible with average hydration,"I have to use a lot of this product and mix it with water so it actually spreads onto my hair. The hydration is pretty average and I end up using it as a conditioner. It leaves my hair very soft and manageable but the smell, man. It smells like olive oil. I hate the smell of olive oil. It's like they didn't add any fragrance at all. Unless that is the fragrance???? This is me petitioning for Shea to make this smell like vanilla. Nonetheless, it's the only product I've found that makes my very fine very dry hair moisturized enough that I don't rip my hair out on accident attempting to brush it so I'll continue to use it until I find something better. Ugh."
21,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,NEXT LEVEL!!!!,Living outside of the US for years in a country that didn't have a significant ethnic hair population or Amazon access. my hair has suffered.The only upside about being back in the US is access to the products I need(the duality of my love/hate for American consumerism is a whole other topic).Im a guy so I started with the sheamoisture shampoo and conditioner from the same line. Figure that was enough to start my hair repair journey and it was. Both products are amazing.Then a friend suggested a hair masque for deep conditioning . No clue what either of those were. Bought the masque and deep conditioned.OMG this MASQUE!!!! The normal conditioner was great and will continue to use that for my wash and go's but the masque is a must have for my weekly deep conditionThe difference was immediate. Your hair instantly feels healthier and softer and smells amazing100% Recommend
22,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I used this deep conditioner alongside a color deposit mask and left it on for one hour and my hair is silky smooth. I have used this conditioner on its own and my hair feels moisturized soft manageable. This is definitely my go to deep conditioner after color or protein treatments. I also use it weekly to keep my hair healthy. I have thick curly hair so to have it sleek and straight is a blessing. Get this conditioner you will not regret it. I suggest using this 1-2 times per week if you have dry hair."
23,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing you could do for your hair!,"I have thin white girl hair that dries out & breaks very easily. I've been on a journey to grow it out & take better care of it for the past few years & only just started looking in to hair masks (I know, I'm disappointed in myself too).I was looking for something that would be simple for a beginner & I found this beautiful product. I love the smell of coconut, so that was very persuasive, but I was not expecting it to smell THAT amazing. Honestly, sometimes I'd just open the jar & sniff it just for the sake of sniffing it.You get a hefty amount for the size of the container. Mine was filled to the brim & I used a decent amount of it on my hair at least once a week; didn't even make a dent. Granted, I don't have super thick hair, so that might vary for other people. It's a little tricky to apply if you don't go section by section to really rub it in, but that's a given because it's so full of moisturizer. Put it up in a clip, leave it in for as long as possible, wash it out with lukewarm water & my hair would feel softer than any conditioner I've ever used, & I'd smell like coconut for days after the fact. Again, I cannot stress enough how delicious it smells.My only complaint is that when my first container came, the paper seal on the inside was broken for some reason. Luckily it hadn't made any kind of mess on the lid or in the package box, but just a thing I felt needed to be mentioned.Also, something I learned the hard way; you are not able to comb/brush through your hair with this mask on. It does it job & hangs on to your hair until washed out with water. I though I'd put the mask on & braid my hair to keep it locked in longer, but that didn't pan out like I though it would & I ended up breaking my hair quite a bit trying to figure out why I couldn't comb through it (completely my fault, I have no one to blame but myself). However, if you braid your hair BEFORE putting the mask on & then slather the braids up after, it works perfectly fine.Over all, I absolutely love this product & am looking to get another if I don't manage to find the tub I somehow miss-placed about a week ago. 10/10 would recommend to anyone with any type of hair looking for some major hydration & sweet sweet coconut smells."
24,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle: Repaired Damaged Hair!,"I bought this hair masque for my grandma because her hair was becoming extremely dry and brittle. In addition, her scalp was itchy and it was overall and unpleasant experience. Previously, I bought her other products because I assumed it was dandruff. As a last resort, I got the hair masque and I’m glad I did.Within 2 weeks, her hair regained its wavy texture and became softer and even shiny! Her hair transformed so much to the point it’s literally a miracle. So, I advised her to scrunch in the hair masque right after coming out of the shower (on wet hair) and to just leave it until her hair dries.I also got a chance to see the hair masque in person...and wow. It smells amazing, like in a natural way, rather than a chemical way. Also, the product is really thick and dense. It took a good minute to wash the product off my hands. That, in my opinion, is what makes this product top quality. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a very moisturizing product."
25,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Caution: I received not genuine product,"What I received was already opened.  The safety seal was cracked and broken at the halfway mark with dirt on the edge of it, and the product inside the container had been scooped out and replaced with ?  It smelled really bad and I wasn't about to use an unknown product that had been tampered with.  Was hoping the other negative reviews were anomalies, but they were not.  :("
26,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you bleach, it’s a must!","As you can see from my profile pictures I like to color my hair with vibrant colors. I have Native American hair so bleaching takes A LOT out of my hair. I use this product daily a week before starting the bleaching process and immediately after. My hair feels great! Usually after bleaching my hair feels like a rubber band wig, but after using this mask you can barely tell that I have bleached my hair from the feel of it. My hair is soft, strong, and healthy as can be. I highly recommend this product! It smells good, it works great, and it’s not overly pricey."
27,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well!,"I have medium-thick curly hair and was a little worried to try this after some of the reviews. My hair gets very very dry in the winter time especially with it being curly. This deep conditioner smells like vanilla and yes it does have a fairly strong smell. To me it’s not overwhelming but the perfect amount, you can definitely still smell it the next day. If a stronger scent isn’t your thing, I don’t recommend this at all. Another thing is that this is a thick deep conditioner and it does take awhile to wash out. I highly highly recommend using a brush while in the shower to brush it through your hair at least a little bit. Overall, this conditioner works pretty well!  My hair felt nice and smooth afterwards and helped with the tangles. Doesn’t leave a residue as long as you wash it all out of your hair."
28,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's not bad, but....","This product is not bad.  I usually use it as a deep conditioner on my locs. I put it through my entire hair from root, to ends and sit under the hair dryer for about 45 min to 1hr. I don't deep condition it every time I wash it but maybe every 2-3 months. I've also used this and just sat with a shower cap on,  slept in it and washed it out in the morning. It does soften my hair, and I can tell it puts moisture in my hair.  My problem is residue. Even after being washed out if leave residue in my hair that won't come off unless I take a wash cloth and rub it out of my hair.  It's actually frustrating bc I have locs, I try not have things that leaves residue behind. It also makes my hair look grayish or whitish in the area where the residue is. The conditioner it's self is kind of thick in nature and clumpy,  not like cottage cheese but like Greek yogurt maybe idk. Maybe the v results will differ without locs but I doubt it."
29,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Essential for curly hair!,"I love this product. I just love it. I don't think I'll ever stop using it.I have fine hair, and my curls did not have much definition before I started consciously caring for it. I follow some aspects of the Curly Girl Method, and I try to avoid harsh chemicals on my hair. It seemed like this mask was recommended by so many 'curly girls' , and was free of those harsh chemicals, so I decided to give it a try. I wash my hair twice a week, and use this mask once a week. So in my second wash of the week, I apply this mask after cleansing with low-poo shampoo. My results last into my second wash. My curls are SHINY and defined.I've noticed my curls are not as tight or shiny when I don't use this mask. It definitely makes a difference in my hair. I highly recommend."
30,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Mask,"This product doesn’t feel like it’s doing anything to my hair. I have tried to love this product so badly, but I just don’t see a difference. After I rinse this out it feels like I just shampoo and it leaves my hair frizzy and brittle. I think it also contains protein, which might be the cause of why my hair felt dry and brittle.UPDATE: This mask is actually a REALLY good mask. I’ve been using it wrong however. When I was experimenting with this product one last time, I noticed my hair was extremely defined, moisturized, and strengthened. I used this product with the Miele Organics Rosemary Mint Strengthening Mask and used a deep conditioning plastic cap. The definition I got was so unexpected. I love this mask now. I use it once every 3 weeks-once a month."
31,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Moisturizing and Smells Great!,"I absolutely love this deep conditioning mask. I use it once a week or every two weeks as a quick 10 min hair mask and it keeps my hair soft, moisturized and detangled. I was dealing with a ton of dryness and bad texture but after I started using this regularly, it’s been so much easier to keep my hair moisturized and healthy.I haven’t used this as a longer 30 min mask so I don’t know if there are any benefits for using it longer. I tend it use it more like a regular hair conditioner but it’s made a big difference and I’ve repurchased it twice.One thing to note: if you have a lot of hair or really thick hair, you’ll run through this pretty quickly so keep that in mind. If you’re very generous with deep conditioners or need to use a lot of product to cover all of your hair this may not be a great product because you’ll need to buy this too frequently."
32,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Frizz-Free, Fuss-Free Product Leaves Hair Luxuriously Baby-Soft (No Kidding!)","This conditioner really works superbly to detanglize, soften, and moisturize my very dry, color-treated, naturally-curly hair! It prevents frizz and leaves a very noticeable difference after every use that lasts far better than gazillions of other products I've tried.I like to apply it thoroughly after washing my hair, before tightly wrapping a warm towel around it for a while. I then go about my usual household activities before finally rinsing it out in the sink. It leaves my hair baby-soft, and allows my curls to thrive - without the unwanted frizz & fuss! It's amazing how soft it makes my aging hair, and leaves me feeling great.I had been buying this at the drugstore in smaller, individual packets that ended up costing me more, but was so happy to find it in a larger, more economical quantity on Amazon. Thank you! 😁👍"
33,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Deep Conditioner!,"I have relaxed hair & I have been experiencing the worst case of ""dry winter hair"" that I can remember ever!  I've been trying different products to try to alleviate this problem, in addition to wearing a bun & silk scarf most of the time & even wearing the same under my winter hat.  This product is a wonderful deep conditioner!  After leaving it on my hair for about an hour, my hair was hydrated & felt extremely soft.  Also, detangling was a breeze!  I would definitely buy this again.  Side note:  I mixed this product with olive oil before applying & I wore a Plastic cap & a heated cap over that.  Good buy!"
34,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same as original Shea Moisture product,I’ve used this product many times but this one from Amazon is not the same. It smells different from the original and it did not define my curls like it normally does. Returning to Amazon and going to buy from store.
35,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for Low Porosity Hair,I’ve done a A LOT of research on my hair type. This is the best stuff. I do dilute the conditioner before I put it in my hair but that’s what the internet said to do and it works.
36,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,It's just not intense at all,"Sadly, this does about as well as my regular drug store conditioner. I followed directions and used this for 30 mins with a warm wrap on my head. After rinsing and rinsing...my hair just felt limp. I didn't see any decrease in static or fly-aways. I'm Caucasian with dyed brown hair that is fairly fine but there is a lot of it. My hair smelled lovely, so there's that. But I wouldn't buy this again, thinking it is some miracle cream to return shine to my hair, or smooth while leaving it swingy."
37,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect deep conditioner to maintain protein and moisture balance,"This is is my first deep conditioner (thats not a sample) and you might not think you can take my word that it's truly good but let me tell you this is my 2nd time going natural and i've been doing a whole new routine that incorporates this deep conditioner and it def works. It smells amazing and it leaves my hair soft (but not overly moisturized) and strong; perfectly ready to take in my leave in conditioner. My natural hair has been stagnant to my shoulders and it's now slowly but surely making it's way to bra strap length. I have been tempted to try more deep conditioners but as high school musical said, stick to what you know! And also, what's not broken, don't fix so I'm not going to bother with anything else."
38,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,BEST LOW COST HYDRATING HAIR MASK OUTTHERE!!!,"To be honest, I bought this hair mask because I didn't have money to go for a more expensive one (Milkshake's integrity hair mask was my top choice), so I read all the good reviews for this one, checked the ingredient list, and thought, why not? well, I found GOLD!!! this hair mask isn't so softening and doesn't leave my hair so good looking like the milkshake one, but it definitely hydrates!!!It leaves my hair soft enough, shiny, and manageable without leaving it heavy or greasy. It lasts a long time because it's really concentrated, and the smell is really good. However, if you're looking to straighten your hair just like I do, be sure to use a good termination product because this mask doesn't help much in adding the needed softness you look for in a blow out; despite that, I would recommend this hair mask to everyone who is looking for a good shot of hydration and shine for a low cost."
39,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Use it for 2 purposes,"Yes it’s good to keep hair ends smelling great, healthy, soft and conditioned. But it’s also amazing for shaving sensitive areas. It’s so moisturizing and slick that I haven’t had nicks or bumps once since I ran out of shaving lotion and thought to give this a try."
40,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,This product is fake??,"This product is different from the one I bought at CVS. When I opened the new bottle I noticed that the safety seal had been removed and that was the first red flag. It smells, feels, and looks different. The one that is almost empty is the one that I bought at CVS. I took this picture right when I bought it but just now making the review. I tried out the product and it is not as useful as the one I bought at CVS. The formula is different so I don't think it works as well. Don't buy from Amazon!"
41,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for low porosity, strong smell","I'm pretty happy with this product. I have low porosity hair, so I was a bit concerned about all the heavy oils in it, but if you cover your hair with a shower cap and heat it with a hairdryer for 15 minutes or so (as directed on the packaging), it gets absorbed without leaving any grease or oils behind. My hair feels nice and soft, and it really helped my elasticity.My one problem is that it has a really strong smell. It's not a bad smell, but it's strong, and it's taken me a while to get used to it. If strong, heavy fragrances really bother you, or give you headaches, DO NOT buy this product! As is, I don't think I'll buy it again, but I don't mind it enough to return it. Hope this helps!"
42,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Has made a huge difference in my hair - love it,"My hair was very dry, lifeless, and would get tangled so easily. I was looking for an affordable hair mask that would make an actual difference. After reading some reviews I decided to give this one a try and it has made an enormous difference in my hair. It is soft, shiny, and it actually feels healthy like it did years ago."
43,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,There's something off about this product.,"Normally, I purchase this conditioner at target and have loved this product for years. This is the first time ever purchasing off amazon and I'm a bit suspicious about the product I received. It doesn't smell the way it should and the consistency is a little off. I don't want to accuse the seller of any shady dealings, but as I mentioned before, I have used this product for years and this one seem different. In the future I will stick to buying this a target. I did use it and it made my hair feel nice that's why I gave it 3 stars, but I was suspicious the whole time it was in my hair."

I need like half a tub of hair mask. With that being said this hair mask is the absolute best. Smell wise, texture wise, healing wise. My hair is strong, healthy, shiny and smells amazing. It is super buttery and thick but doesn’t make your hair greasy. I will never buy another hair mask."

I don't use heat on my hair and sometimes my hair needs a little drink. This reduces the amount of frizz on my head and sometimes I use this as a regular conditioner, its that good. This hair masks is nice and thick, I have long thick hair and I don't need too much of this stuff to cover my head. This can last me a few months and then I have to order a another one."

50,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for bleached curly hair,This is my absolute favorite hair mask. I have bleached curly hair and it does get dry fairly often. I’m able to put this in for a few minutes and my hair is magically soft and moisturized again. It has a scent although I can’t put my finger on it. The scent in general isn’t very strong with I was pleasantly surprised when I first tried this. I’ve tried other hair mask and I always go back to this one. A little goes a very long way so I don’t feel like I’m wasting money on it

All the shampoos I use dry out my hair and give it a weird texture, but as soon as I use this conditioner it immediately becomes soft and easy to comb through. Nothing has ever worked better on my hair. It smells sooo good and I must admit it’s kind of fun to scoop it out of the container."
53,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my favorite Mask from Shea Moisture,"One of my favorite Mask from Shea Moisture- Works well for my type 4 (a-c), low porosity, fine hair"
54,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"This hair mask is amazing. I only had it on for 5 minutes in the shower and it made my hair super soft and shiny. It also smells great. Did not leave my hair greasy at all. I have thick, long, wavy hair that gets frizzy after I wash it. No frizz after using this mask."
55,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great deep conditioner.,"Great product, this is my favorite deep conditioner from Shea moisture. Not much slip, my hair always feels well hydrated and moisturized after deep conditioning under my heat cap for 30minutes. This is also a great base conditioner for doing a Henna gloss; it really balances the strength of the henna with moisture. Packaging was great, shipping was fine."
56,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Made hair drier and tangled,"This product was very disappointing. I tried this and it made my hair so dry and instantly tangled. Even when wet, my hair felt brittle after using this. I waited a few days and my hair went back to a bit more normal so I tried it again, same thing. Very dry, brittle, and I have no way to prove this but I swear I got more split ends. Save your money and go with a different product."
57,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,This mask is great! It does not smell like play dough like there other masks. It makes my hair soft and helps to clump the curls. I have 4b/4c hair
58,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The boing is back, very soft","Love this deep conditioner. I have 3B curly hair that is going grey in places and is damaged from bleach and dye. This seriously moisturized my limp, dull curls, now they are shiny, soft, and have their boing back. It doesn't have the silicone or mineral oil common to deep conditioners I've tried, so my hair is not weighed down at all. Try it, it seems to suit multiple hair types."
59,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Soooo soft!,"The scent was very strong and overwhelming at first. I thought I wasn't going to be able to get used to it, but now I absolutely love it. My hair is naturally sooooo dry (2B waves, fine, high density). I use this as a regular conditioner and just leave it on for a minute or two in the shower. My hair feels great, now."
60,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry hair,"I am 69 years old with long hair.  It tends to be very dry, even though I only wash every couple of weeks.  This stuff is great.  I used it on my hair for 30 minutes and was amazed how much softer my hair was.  My hair is on the curly side, so it seems to frizz easy.  This product made a huge difference,  I would highly recommend it!"
61,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,awesome,"the smell is amazing, but quite strong. It works amazing on my 4c natural hair, though. It's very moisturizing and something I've been looking for to keep my hair soft after wash day!"
62,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this....,I have bought this brand on and off amazon many times. I love love love. I even mixed with other products to make it last longer. I have a lot of hair. And very dry scalp. This product works wonders. I totally recommend.
63,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Completely is helping my hair become healthy again!,This mask is amazing! My hair is dry and damaged and after a few uses 2x a week its soft and manageable and just feels healthier. The smell isn't my fave but its totally bearable especially with how amazing my hair feels after I use it!!! Load your hair up with this stuff and throw a plastic bag on your head to trap the heat from your scalp and leave in for about an hour at least and your hair will thank you for it!
64,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so Good & Good Slip,I use the shampoo & conditioner from this line and loved them. So I figured I would like the deep conditioner too. The consistency is good - not too thick and not thin either. I left it in my hair overnight and rinsed out. It smells AMAZING! The slip on it is great too. I have 3c low porosity hair - also colored with blonde highlights. Its amazing so far.
65,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Too strong a fragrance for people sensitive to smells.,"The fragrance was soo strong, I has a headache in a few hours. Could not wait to come home and shampoo it away. Not good for people who are sensitive to smell. Have had no issues with other conditioners from this company before. Was surprised."
66,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Scent, slip and softness",Love everything about this conditioner! The scent is not overpowering. Great slip! My hair is so soft after using this but not flat afterwards.
67,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Easily one of the most moisturizing products in history.,High porosity game changer. It’s thick and cool and takes some working it but once it’s melts in it’s like a rain forest.I would only use on type 4 hair that’s coarse. I’m 4a and get that juicy swing but it might weigh down type 3 hair.
68,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Instantly works!,"I am a firm believer in this brand, this is the BEST hair mask! Instantly you can feel the difference in your hair while just lathering it in. A small amount goes along way too. I have been using it for about two weeks and can see the different in my hairs health"
69,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing,I have super dry low porosity hair and this product leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it with either a shower cap or my hair steamer. It smells very nice however it is a bit thick so i just add a little water and it's perfect.
70,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,NOT for humid climates,"I have fairly dry hair, but this does nothing but make my hair limp. If I use this and it’s humid outside, my hair gets super frizzy and goes straight. I prefer the blue protein mask. also I do not like the scent at all. this is TOO moisturizing for my hair type. For reference, I have 3A hair."
71,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,It came opened?!,"The product is great its self. When I opened the amazon package, the product was also wrapped in plastic. The plastic was ripped, and the styrofoam seal was opened. Amazon didn't really have anything to help besides returning the package. I really didn't care too much it was just concerning. Besides the packaging issues, the product is great and I love it."
72,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Feels and smells great!,Omg! This stuff is amazing! I use it every other week because I alternate with a protein hair mask. this stuff works and feels so luxurious. It leaves my curls so soft. I use it as per the recommendation on the jar and also always add product after using it. Great stuff and I will be repurchasing.
73,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is the BEST! I have thick, coarse hair and have tried about every conditioner there is (expensive stuff to cheap stuff) and this is the best I’ve found!!"
74,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,How awesome this hair mask is and great price!!!,I loved this product first the smell was amazing second you could actually feel how moisturizing it really was. And when you placed it through your hair it sinks In and you need only about quarter size amount. The results were fantastic my hair never looked so good or felt so soft in a long time. I have curly hair and man did it take away frizz and made my curls look like dreamy curls everyone would want. def. Get it and you will love it. I will be buying again!!!!!
75,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,fake,Do bot purchase!! this is a fake.... scam!!!! look at the packaging and the smell is off. dont waste your money.. irder from target you will get the real one
76,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for all hair,"Not for 4c hair! It made my hair tangled and curlier, I will be returning. Aussie 3-minute miracle is better."
77,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, horrible package delivery","Love Shea Moisture products! This is just another great product of theirs to add to my list. Love the smell and it does wonders to my hair. My only complaint and I guess a heads up to others who are looking to buy, it may come horribly messy!! I never have a bad delivery experience but this was my 1st! A lot of the product was smothered into the packaging envelope. Top to the container somehow popped off and product spilled out. A mess to clean up."
78,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hidden treasure but not for much longer!,"SheaMoisture products are a hidden treasure, or at least they were but their popularity is definitely on the rise thanks to how great their products are! I fell in love with their hair products and I just did a skincare haul on their line and can’t wait to try them too!"
79,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Great! Super moisturizing!,This smells sooo good! I left this product in my hair overnight with braids and a shower cap. My hair was super soft the next day. I'm sure it would have worked fine if I rinsed it out the same day but we ( curly heads )  know the longer the better;) Highly recommend.
80,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great deep conditioner for my thick, coarse, frizzy curls.","Nice and thick deep conditioner! I'm starting to wear my thick hair naturally curly and this is just what I needed to prep my curls in the shower. After shampooing I put a generous amount throughout my hair then detangle with a wide tooth comb. I put my hair up, put a shower cap on and rinse out with cool water at the end of my shower."
81,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for high porosity and normal porosity hair.,I love this deep conditioner for my youngest daughter’s type 4b high porosity hair as well as my oldest daughters type 4a normal porosity hair.

84,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,This product did not work at all for me and my daughter. It basically just sat on our strands and did not penetrate and I left mine on overnight. We also used a heat cap....sooo.... it was a no go for us.
85,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"EXCELLENT brand, love all of their products","Love, love, LOVE Shea Moisture products.  Always impressed with how well they work, even compared to pricey salon brands. All of the products are free of harmful ingredients which is great for anyone with already over processed hair."
86,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend,I bought this conditioner because it does NOT have any dimethicone like the others that claim to be the best. This one is acutally the best by far.
87,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls Hydrated,My 2c & 3a curls had not been curling well especially the top layer. I used this Hydration Masque first time for 30 min wrapped head in a hot towel. Hair was soft and had more curl. I have continued to use it whenever I wash my hair and leave it in for 10 to 15 min. My curls have just been getting curlier and more defined.
88,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bomb!,My favorite product from shea moisture. It just makes my hair so soft and manageable. I use it with my steamer and detangling is a breeze.
89,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for baby fine, low porosity hair.","The smell is off, almost like a fried food, but it really does make my hair soft. I have baby fine, low porosity hair. I recommend it."
90,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like a dream,"I love this stuff. I try  to do a mask at least once a week. When It's been longer, or I've been terrible to myself and my hair has gotten dry, I apply and leave it on for a day before rinsing it out. Smell absolutely AMAZING. Oh and the softness? My hair feels loved.Def would buy again."
91,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Moisturizing but has a strong smell,I use this product regularly and it is a great moisturizing conditioner. But I wish the smell wasn't as strong
92,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite Shea Moisture mask!!,"When I got this  my 4b hair was DRY and in need of some great moisturizing. It's my first time trying this one cuz my holy grail is the jbco mask but this just became number one! The mask is thick and buttery, which is how I like them and it brought back that cloud like fluffiness and softness to my hair. I was even able to finger detangle in the shower and yes the scent is good kinda like Shea butter. 10/10 will definitely buy again!"
93,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry 3c curls,"Works REALLY well for my frizzy 3c curls. I use it with heat (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZHLVDW4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?) for 30 min and rinse with cold water. I get shiny, soft, frizz-free curls!"

98,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product,"I started just using the shampoo and conditioner at first, that worked greatly then i started to look in on all the product. I am currently using mostly all of the hair products. ( shampoo, conditioner, gel, mousse, leave in conditioner  and course the Masque. Love Shea Moisture product. it bought life back to my hair."
99,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing and conditioning,I love this deep conditioning treatment. It makes your hair so soft and really conditions and moisturizes. I definitely recommend. Also this company does not animal test which is extremely important to me.
100,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Impressed,Disappointed. I tried Shea Moisture. I really did. Gotta cancel all your products. Get it together and I might come back. For now it's a NO for me.

102,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW, my curls turned out so soft and pretty!",I really loved how soft and pretty my curls turned out.  I got so many compliments and I know it is due to the moisture this masque gave my hair.  I love it and it smells awesome.
103,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing,Works great on the dry streaks on the back. I use it everyday because my hair is wavy and dry. I leave it on around 5 minutes and then shampoo it out. It helps my hair by moisturizing and makes it softer.
104,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hair mask!,"I’ve used many high end hair masks from redken, pureology, etc. This mask is better than salon brands and it’s natural. I have wavy, long, dry and damaged hair. This works so well and makes my hair so soft and my hair always looks so good after I use it. I use it once a week for around 15 minutes. The smell is so good too."
105,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Hair Mask,I am a swim instructor so before I get into the water I always put a hair mask on my hair so my hair does not dry out and this mask has done an amazing job of keeping my hair moisturized throughout the day and feels so soft whenever I take a shower after my shift

And it worked! I recommended it to all of my friends and they loved it as well. I totally love this mask and I'm writing the review after one year of using it (I finished my fouth or fifth bottle) !

I kept it on for 15 minutes while I soaked in the tub. My hair feels so soft now. Before I used this mask my hair was so dry that it felt rough to the touch like straw!

113,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Eh…,"Personally, thought it smelled a little strong. There was little to no change in my hair. My scalp liked it, but it didn’t work miracles. Spend $10 more and get something that works."
114,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nada hidratante,Compre esta mascarilla por recomendación de una influencer.  Aunque siento q rellena muy bien la hebra de mi cabello pero lamentablemente no me hidrata.  Siento que el cabello me queda empegotado.

   Perfect moisture for your hair and it does not leave a heave residue! Put enough on your hair after washing it and let it dry naturally!! My hair is  moisturized after this! I use it as a daily leave in conditionerUpdate: I have been using this solely now for a year!! It’s a winner 06.14.2020You will notice a difference immediately!! But over time your hair will be soft and perfect. Great for dry hair. My crown is no longer dry with this.1-23-2021 I am still using this daily! My crown is rarely dry anymore? You hair repairs overtone."
469,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,First deep conditioning product I've enjoyed!,"I haven't really been taking care of my hair over the past year due to long hours at work, stressful family issues, etc. I use a basic shampoo with sulfates, but I've tried sulfate-free shampoos and the result is always the same: as my hair dries, even if I don't touch it, it starts to frizz and feel very rough and coarse. Once in awhile I'll try and blow-dry it which seems to help slightly but it never really feels good to the touch and I'm sure the heat isn't helping long-term so I just end up putting it up due to how bad it looks.I saw this at the store and got it on a whim, and I'm so glad I did! I wasn't really expecting much out of it but after one use my hair is noticeably softer and silkier. I didn't even leave it on that long, so I'm pleased with how much less dry and frizzy my hair feels. It's actually very soft to the touch and after it dried, I didn't even put it up because it actually looked nice! It's the only thing I changed up in my hair routine so I know it's this product that's causing the improvement. I basically just shampooed my hair, put a generous amount of this product in and finger-combed from roots to ends, then did the rest of my shower routine before fully rinsing it out. It was probably on my hair for under 10 minutes.Since I've only used it one time, I'll update the review in the future if I notice any negatives. But for now I definitely will start using it more often. It also smells amazing which is a huge bonus!!"
470,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing conditioner for swimmers hair 1c type,"Swimming is not kind to your hair or skin. This conditioner is amazing! Don't waste your money on hair products marketed for ""swimmers"". I used Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo and left the mask in my hair  to shave and wash off a facial mask, about 10 minutes. Its as soft as it was before I started swimming again. Once I run out of the current shampoo I will give the shampoo in the same collection a try. Will be stocking up on this product. Again, amazing."
471,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Left my hair feeling nice and soft.,"Used this once so far and my hair feels softer.  I have very thick, course hair and regular conditioners just make my hair limp.  I applied it to my dry hair, put on a plastic cap [or you could wrap your hair in plastic wrap], left in on for 20+ minutes and then showered and washed my hair.It's nice and thick so there's no running or dripping.  Will probably just use it once a month.  Doesn't have much of a scent but nice enough."
472,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Acts more like a protein treatment, made hair hard!","I was in the market for a moisturizing hair masque. Something to make my 4b hair feel soft and hydrated. Read the reviews and bought. It came and the seal with already broken which was already a red flag. It smells like typical shea moisture products, not fruity at all more like essential oils which I expected. Put it on my hair and left it on for half an hour. Rinsed it out and my hair felt hard and was extremely hard to detangle. Would not recommend. Will stick to the Raw sugar avocado and banana oil masque, it works like a dream & is 10 bucks at target!"
473,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked as promised,"I rarely leave reviews on here, but this hair masque is worth every penny.My hair ( mostly the bottom four inches) was pretty damaged from the summer. I was out playing golf in the sun four days a week or more and the sun really bleached out my hair.I haven't been going to the salon due to COVID, and my hair literally looked and felt like straw.I dampened my hair and worked a good bit of the masque into the damaged portion, ran it through with a wide tooth comb, and let it sit for about an hour.Rinsed it out, washed my roots/scalp, conditioned the ends and rinsed thoroughly, then blow dried.The difference is HUGE. Silky soft ends, no more straw hair.  This went way beyond my expectations, I'm thrilled!Highly recommend. 10/10."
474,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hydration Low Prosity Hair Must Have !!,"This is a must have for low porosity dry damage broken hair!!

475,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Espectacular!!,"Hidrata muy bien, ya sea que lo dejes solo 5 minutos o 30 minutos con un gorro y calor. Tengo el pelo rizado 3a 3b y no le pesa a mi cabello (claro hay que cuidar las cantidades) Con un poco de producto, tamaño de una almendra, es suficiente. El olor es exquisito. Me encanta"
476,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"3c, 4a, Low Porosity, Medium density","I have used this product 2 times in 1 month and my hair feels like it did when I was 10 yrs old. The softness and moisture has been restored and I cannot keep my hands out of it. I have used the Jamaican Black Castor Oil treatment for a year and saw very little difference unless I sat under the dryer. Hands down, the Intensive Hydration Masque will always be what I reach for!"
477,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It does the job,I can’t say it goes above and beyond but it gets the job done.

487,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I love this stuff, but my hair loves it even more. The moisture, the softness, the smell... pure heaven! Highly recommend"
488,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonders,"This masque leaves your hair so soft, manageable and moisturized. Works perfectly on my 4c, low porosity hair. I will purchase this again."
489,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I hate title lines,"HOW TO USE :wet hair in the shower and massage generously from scalp to endsdo everything elsethen apply shampoo directly (I usually use a 'conditioner shampoo' but it works well with a regular one too) and rinse with cold waterI learned about shea moisture when I worked at a beauty supply store. I do not personally have ethnic hair, but I liked the ingredients and story behind the company and began using their products.This one in particular was difficult to work with because of how thick the texture was. It felt like slathering straight up nivea on my head til I figured I could water it down in the jar and use it on wet hair. It was a game changer. If you're having issues with this product, try it this way.I have thick asian hair (plus its heavily bleached), ranging from 1b-2a,  so not the target audience for these products, but I believe theyre quite universal.I don't think it's a bad product, it is probably specifically targetting a certain hair texture and seems to work fine for that, but for most 1a-2c, this method gives the best results.Update : so apparently this is in fact only made for type 4 hair as I predicted HOWEVER you can still use it if you're not a type 4 by adding a lot of water. I find that it works well because it maintains the structure of my super porous hair"
490,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product! Smells so good!,"My first month using this conditioning product and I could not ask for more! I love it! I use it almost every day. Some people wash their hair a few times a week; it does not work for my hair. My hairs actually misbehave when I wait a few days. before I wash. It also took much longer to brush or comb out. It feels softer and behaves much better when I wash it daily; and this product helps me keep my hair soft and luscious. It smells so good to me, the product works on my hair and the price is amazing too for what you are getting! I Will buy it again and I highly recommend it!"
491,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,"I’ll start by saying I am a woman of color but I have very “different” hair. I generally have loose coils, thick roots, and somewhat of thin but still kinda thick hair.Well… This is the product I’ve been missing all of my life. I used a new shampoo and conditioner by another brand and I was not impressed. My hair felt less moisturized, dull, fragile.. just everything I didn’t want it to feel like. I decided to try this masque to bring my hair back to life, and boy it did. Very satisfied with how well it took to my hair."
492,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"ONE OF THE BEST FOR DRY, CURLY HAIR!","Really has worked very well on my incredibly dry, long salt 'n pepper curls.  One note: need to rinse VERY VERY WELL, or it can make your hair *seem* oily when it's not. Leaves my hair full of moisture & springy curls that bounce back into place w/out having to add additional moisture or leave-in conditioner like I usually have to.The first time I used it, thought I'd rinsed ok but then it seemed to collect all the dust in the air,  (we live in a place that was near huge fires last year, the dust has become so bad that if you dust something, a few hrs later it already needs to be dusted again.). If I rinse w/ the intent of REALLY rinsing well, its better."
493,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,So Far So Good - Don't Cut Yourself,First night I used it was for a quick 5 minute mask replacing my conditioner. The next morning my hair was much less frizzy and looked more smooth and was manageable. Only complaint - is second time I used it and gripped the lid with my fingers extending beyond the underside of the lid is that the twist motion actually cut my finger on the sharp underside or the lid like a nice paper cut. Use a flat hand and apply pressure on top of the lid to open it.
494,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Regret buying this with shampoo and conditioner,Didn’t hydrate as the review said that this and the shampoo and conditioner would. I got a lot of breakage and fall out. My hair became very dry and brittle using Lotta body works better and it actually moisturizing/hydrating.
495,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I haven’t found better yet! Love this conditioner! My hair is 4b and I know this is conditioner is the reason I get so many compliments on how healthy my hair is.
496,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a variety of hair types,"First of all, the scent is AMAZING. The smell stayed in my hair until the next wash. It made my 3a hair feel amazing without being too heavy (I made sure to rinse well). My boyfriend has 4c hair and he absolutely loves this as well. We've always loved this brand but this one is definitely a new favorite."
497,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cabellos suave e hidratado,"Me encanta... me deja el cabello super suave y manejable. Tenia un problema de resequedad en mi cabellos se me estaban saliendo y partiendo mucho, desde que la empece a usar noto el cambio. La alterno con un acondicionador de milk shake y la diferencia es mucha en cuanto a como queda el pelo. Solo se necesita un poco y hace el trabajo. Me la aplico todas las semanas despues del lavado. 100% recomendada"
498,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"I use this product about once every two weeks. I use the hair masque after using the SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Marfura Oil shampoo and left it on for only a few minutes, I'd didn't see much improvement. However, when I decided to ""occlude"" my hair with a shower cap and apply heat, it really shut down the breakage in my hair. My hair felt healthy, thicker, and softer. I didn't have to fight with the pick to untangle my hair. I'm pleased with the results. Great product!"
499,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for naturally curly hair that needs some extra tlc.,"This conditions my hair beautifully. It's really thick as a deep conditioner treatment should be. Doesn't make my hair feel overly heavy or too oily afterwards. I have thick, curly and coarse hair so managing it can be a nightmare but this has helped me so much. I love the smell. So natural and clean not overly perfumed."
500,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfection,"I left this mask on after washing my hair, put a plastic cap on and went about my business for about 30-45mins. My hair was butter. Extra soft and moisture was amazing. Great for thick curly,koily or kinky hair."
501,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT!!,"My daughter, who is 6, has extremely thick, curly, dry and frizzy hair. Her hair type is 3B. I have been searching for decent products that actually do what they are supposed to and don't break the bank. This is it! It moisturizes and keeps her hair soft. I do use a combo of other products, but with help from this intense mosturizer, we are no longer dealing with frizz! So thankful I found this product."
502,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,You cannot beat this product,"Works amazing on all hair types. I have 3b and 3c even some 4b/c mixed in and this detangles, softens and keeps it smooth and tangle free for the next couple days even. Works the same on my girls wavy hair. Keeps their tangles and mats at bay!"

504,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"No, not at all.",Average at best. Did zero to help my processed long hair and the scent is sickening. Had to wash my hair afterwards to get rid of it. Sorry but this one is a no go.

543,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",Size: 12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Me encantó esta mascarilla para el cabello, tiene una textura muy cremosa y se distribuye muy fácilmente por todo el cabello. Huele delicioso y desde la primera aplicación ví la diferencia. Le devuelve al cabello la suavidad, brillo e hidratación sin dejarlo pesado o grasoso. Además, deja una sensación como si le diera más volumen y grosor al cabello. En mi caso, antes de la aplicación, se sentía delgado y muy frágil, (mi cabello estaba muy seco y se quebraba con facilidad) y después, se sentía grueso y fuerte, suave e hidratado y peinarlo resulta muy fácil, ya que no se enredado para nada.En conclusión, lo recomiendo y sin duda lo volveré a comprar."
544,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",Size: 12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Si se ve una diferencia entre el antes y el después, el único inconveniente es que el envase venía roto, y el producto se estaba saliendo, hasta dejo el empaque lleno de producto. Tengan más cuidado con el embalaje o con el tipo de material con el que van a empacar, que proteja realmente el producto."

Espero les sirva mi comentario. :'D"
546,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",Size: 12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"la mala calificación es por su pésima forma de entregar los productos, venía en un sobre, el producto venía roto y el contenido estaba por todos lados, amazon es muy responsable en su logística de cambios y reembolsos, por lo que antes de que yo regresara el producto, muy amablemente me reenviaron otro para el día siguiente.

563,"SheaMoisture Intensive for Dry,12 oz",Size: 12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Se me hizo raro que el empaque viniera muy equis. Cero sellado y al abrir el contenedor sin ninguna tapita blanca de esas que normalmente traen este tipo de envases. Pero en teoría todo bn. El envase lleno. No podría asegurar que es original y/o nueva. Me dejo con dudas esto del empaque... no me convenció.

0,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Twist-defining Custard Moisturizer for Unisex, 12 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Does nothing - formula changed,"I recently wrote a similar review for another Shea Moisture product that I had used loyally for almost a decade. As I feared, this product formula has also changed. It used to have this rich scent, intense moisture, and great slip that my thick, dry, tight curls loved. This project arrived yesterday and it's essentially hand lotion. It did nothing. I could hardly get it to separate in my hands to smooth on my hair - it just stayed in clumps. And after putting it in my hair, I could hardly get a comb through it. Very disappointed. Shame on Sundial and Unilever for messing with perfection and insulting a very loyal customer base."
1,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Twist-defining Custard Moisturizer for Unisex, 12 Ounce",4.0 out of 5 stars,1) The stuff is absolutely amazing when it comes to making your hair soft,"I'm giving this a four star review for a couple of reasons:1) The stuff is absolutely amazing when it comes to making your hair soft. Holy crap. I'm a 3c and this stuff made my poof ball feel so good! I didn't need a ton of it, and yeah... love it.Why not five stars?2) The smell. I hate, hate, hate the smell. It is sharp and has a ring of cologne. Granted, I have a pretty sensitive nose, but this stuff... whew. Were it not for the amazing way my hair feels, I'd not use it again. Even as it stands, as part of any nightly ritual, I think I'm going to leave it out and stick to the curl enhancing smoothie. I wash my hair twice a week, once with a clarifying shampoo, the other with something far gentler (also by Shea Moisture). I'm likely going to have it just be after my clarifying wash since it tends to leave my hair a bit dry.Other than that... the stuff is like gold as far as moisture and styling. I was delighted by that aspect. If only it smelled like the smoothie. I would be in heaven!"
2,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Twist-defining Custard Moisturizer for Unisex, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smooth for extra dry hair,I love this hair twist moisture product because it's adds moisture to my dry hair especially when it comes to twisting it. Now I have not tried the wet method as of yet but I will the next hair day. The dry method make sure not to put too much or too little and it will take time to figure that solution out but once you get that omg the curls are popping. Now there is a but of a flaking but thats when working with the hair putting it up  or even maybe too much product. But I highly recommend this product for extra dry hair 4c maybe even 4b hair. I don't really have coils I just have zigzag type hair so if this helps I hope it does.
3,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Twist-defining Custard Moisturizer for Unisex, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hold and moisture.,"I like this product for my locs because it's lightweight, holds nice, and doesn't leave that white flaky crust like some other products do. I use it all the time, even when I'm retwisting and styling my locs on my own."
4,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Twist-defining Custard Moisturizer for Unisex, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great twist out cream for 4b/4c hair.,My favorite twist out cream after years of trying many. Hair stays soft and defined which has been hard with my 4b/c hair. I’m currently having a hard time finding it and I really don’t want to have to search for a new cream.
5,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Twist-defining Custard Moisturizer for Unisex, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love is product!,I love this product for my wash n go’s. Add a small amount and mix it with my eco styler gel then shingle my hair and my curls pop everytime.
6,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Twist-defining Custard Moisturizer for Unisex, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for my dry hair.,Can be compared with the Multi vitamin Frizz Taming Smoothie but with less water.It is thick and keeps hair moisturized.Good for high porosity hair  that is dry.The cream is heavy and have nice fragrance.Both 2 bottles will last a very long time.Just use a some bit.
7,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Twist-defining Custard Moisturizer for Unisex, 12 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of white flakes in your hair,Leave’s your hair very flaky!!! No Go!

You can not mix certain products together. Sometimes that’s the reason why it doesn’t work as intended. But with my twist out it was really springy and soft and smelled lovely. I also use it to just hydrate my Afro and pick out sometimes. A little goes a long way because the creme is white and like a custard. I don’t know my hair grade yet so I can’t tell you unless I upload a picture.

On the flip side, it is not that great in comparison to the curl enhancing smoothie for keeping the hair moisturized and juicyfor a long time.The smell is Ah-mazing just like the manuka honey masque.

0,"SheaMoisture Hydrate and Replenish Shampoo, Conditioner and Hair Masque for Curly Hair Manuka Honey and Marfura Oil Deep Conditioning Hair Treatment to Hydrate and Replenish Hair 3 Count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This comes as a boxed set with the shampoo, conditioner, and masque (conditioning treatment).I’ve been a SheaMoisture fan for years now so when I had a curly haired child I knew where to go! I first tried the Raw Shea masque and unfortunately something in it broke him out in a rash but it worked sooo well on my toddler’s 3b hair. I was so excited to try this line and it didn’t disappoint!!First off the smell is heavenly. I wasn’t sure what to think of it at first, kind of a honey floral smell, hard to explain, but it really grew on me and now it’s delicious and I could smell my toddler’s head all day. Seriously! It’s delicious and I want a matching lotion.Anyway, the shampoo is white (not see through or clear) and very conditioning while still cleaning and sudsing on his hair. I actually found it pretty detangling on its own for his thin hair. The conditioner isn’t too thick and has decent slip. I like using a wide tooth comb to detangle with it. The shampoo and conditioner on their own work amazingly on his hair and make it so much more manageable. On days where we don’t wash I use the treatment masque. It’s thick and very hydrating and his hair just sucks it right up. As a great bonus, this set does not cause him any rashes and is very gentle on his hair and skin! I will definitely purchase and recommend to others 😁I hope you found this review helpful"

Although I try to pull out from the sets the ones that are curly girl approved, not all of SheaMoisuture products are, the only one in the set is the Shampoo.I love using this as a deep conditioner once a week and can get 4-5 applications when generously used. I wash my hair and apply a nice amount, quickly comb though and put my heated head wrap on, leaving it over night sometimes. Then, cool rinse in the morning and my hair is very manageable.I’ve used several of the SheaMoisture products and have had great success without spending a ton of money. The only thing is the scent, I like the scent but it’s a tad strong for me."

I’ve had really good experiences with this company and I like their quality products. This product though was not exactly what I was expecting. The product is a little bit on the heavier side due to the type of ingredients that’s in there. I have curly hair type 3b/3c baby fine hair and so it weighed my hair down a little bit too much. If your hair is not baby fine but normal or thick or coarse hair I think this would be a better product for you than it was for me. I liked the scent on it.

She has used other products from this company in the past and she said they always made her hair feel so soft.  In addition to the shampoo and conditioner, you also receive a hair masque.  All 3 smell wonderful because of the Manuka honey.  My wife said these products are a great deal at the current price and highly recommends them."

This is a great value set for the shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask. Despite how ""heavy"" these products are, my hair still felt clean and residue-free afterwards.

This review is for: SheaMoisture Hydrate and Replenish Shampoo, Conditioner and Hair Masque for Curly Hair Manuka ...My hair is now mostly silver/gray/white. As many of us older folks know, gray hair does not act like regular hair. It's more wiry and hard to tame or at least it is for me. This set has helped me get my hair more under my control. I have less fly-aways, less frizz, and more manageability.I especially love the hair mask. It smells wonderful, (I think the entire set smells great), and the difference in my hair after I use it is almost miraculous. It's softer, easier to style and it looks so much healthier!The price is reasonable for this set and as such, I might make it a permanent addition to my hair care regimen."

Just not enough and not as immediate as I prefer."

I did not put anything it after washing,I just let it air dry so I could see how much of a difference it did or didn't make. My hair has been so dry and breaking off lately, I usually have very dry scalp and dandruff so the shampoo I usually use is harsh on my hair. I was a little worried my scalp would suffer if I switched shampoos, but my scalp was super dry and itchy anyways,and the dandruff shampoo did not seem to be helping anymore so I figured it wouldn't hurt, AND MY SCALP ACTUALLY STOPPED ITCHING!! Idk what that has to do with but maybe the dandruff shampoo was TOO harsh and that's what was causing the dryness in the first place? Idk I'm no hair expert. Bit my scalp feels moisturized, my hair is bouncy and silky and it smells sooo good. And i'm super excited, I'll update if my opinion changes"

2,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl.

As a matter of fact, I like their products very much. Yes, I read other people's reviews and just assumed the people who experienced problems were susceptible to sensitivities. However that said, I had problems with this pair of products. I used the set twice. The first time I felt the shampoo left my wavy/curly hair coated. The conditioner seemed to weight it down top of my hair already feeling coated by the shampoo. The next morning I awoke to redness around my hairline as well as some splotches on my face. I also experienced patches on my scalp. I attempted to shampoo my hair with my regular SheaMoisture products but still felt my hair ""coated"" and scalp itchy. So much so I went to the store to purchase a gentle clarifying shampoo. I washed my hair twice the same day until it felt somewhat normal again. I see by the reviews many people have had very successful experiences with this combination. I'm sure it's a wonderful product, it  gave me a scary reaction. I returned the product thanks to Amazon."

I have coarse and dry wavy hair and I made the mistake of dying my hair after already bleaching it. My hair was so damaged it felt like straw when I ran my fingers through my hair and it easily became tangled. After first use of this product my hair feels soft and looks shiny and healthy.

I had pretty much written off SheaMoisture. Then, I tried this Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration version. Game changer. SheaMoisture redeemer!  I love this version and have now repurchased the shampoo, conditioner, and hair masque 2-3 times. The products are extremely moisturizing and leave my hair moisturized and free of tangles. Plus, I am very sensitive to fragrances, and I absolutely love this fragrance! I hope that this product remains consistent and that my hair continues to respond well to it.(The only product in this line that I do not care for is the leave-in milk. The one that I received didn’t have the “signature” fragrance, and it didn’t seem to be particularly moisturizing. However, since this review is for the shampoo and conditioner set, I am not rating the leave-in milk here.)"

Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Products Have Changed,"I was excited to use this shampoo and conditioner. I don't like to write a negative review, but this is my experience.  I have used Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner before. I used it because it's cruelty free, fair trade and because of the pure and natural ingredients. And I liked how it cleansed and conditioned my hair. It stated on the previous bottles that the ingredients are sourced globally. I noticed right away that the scent of this shampoo and conditioner smelled very strong and it didn't smell natural. The company said it's scented with essential oils. I decided to try them. I developed a headache and I also noticed a lot of hair coming out and in the drain. I also noticed that the new bottles have a lot of ingredients that aren't so natural as before ,and that it does not state that the ingredients are sourced globally either. The scent is very strong and doesn't smell natural to me. I had to wash my hair several times to get the scent out. Unilever owns Shea Moisture now.  I do not feel that the products are natural like the were before. I returned the shampoo and conditioner and will not be purchasing their products."

Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Keratin Treated Asian Hair,"I was searching weeks for a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner to use after my first Keratin treatment. After weeks of reading reviews, i decided to go with this brand. First use: the shampoo is not foamy at all - which is a good indication of the absence of sulfates. The conditioner was light and not greasy, something i really enjoy. My hair is originally fine, very frizzy and overly processed. This combo works well on my hair, it is gentle and light. Hair is not weighed down. The scent is like figs and oils mixture but not over-powering. Will order again!"
10,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you are debating on buying this...get it..now!!!!!,"First off, before I tell you how amazing this stuff is, let me say that I transitioned from a perm. My hair was damaged. And following my pregnancy my hair became more brittle and dry by the day. This time last year I shaved most of my head and restarted the growth process. I thought it would help me with a new start. Nope, my hair was still dry and brittle. The past month, I did endless research on what start using in my hair to get it back healthy. My hair does not fall in to 3 or 4 abcdefg or whatever else these curly people classify for their hair. Its naturally just kinky straight with a slight wave, but can be hard to maintain unless it is wet or have leave in conditioner. I didnt want that anymore.So I came across this shampoo and conditioner...this was my last resort before I went back to a perm...oh my heavens!!!!!!!! This stuff is amazing!!!!!!! I knew from the moment I used the shampoo I would love it. It lathered right away, I rinsed it out and my hair was already smoother and softer. I combed through my hair, and put the conditioner in then combed it through my hair again. Immediately my hair felt even better. Then once I rinsed it out, I almost cried. Lol!!! My hair was soooo soft and hydrated, for the first time in almost 2 years. I did not even feel like I needed to add any lotion or hair oil, it was that soft and moisturized. I do not blow dry my hair. Never have..once my hair dried, it dried in its kinly straight texture still feeling hydrated!!! I have never been so impressed by a shampoo and conditioner. But if you have been in my situation then you definitely understand how I feel at the moment.Lastly, i love the smell!!!!! For some it may be too strong, but for me it's amazing. I washed my hair 2 days ago and it still smells amazing. My hair is still soft and manageable. I can comb through it with no issue. I immediately ordered another set because if this stuff runs out, I need it on hand!!!"
11,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair can shine!,"Ok I have thin over colored , over permed , post menopausal hair.  I never thought I could find a shampoo and conditioner that could help it.  Yay I found it.  I read all the reviews and I was scared to try this after all the negative reviews.  I am so glad I tried it.  1 st let's address the smell many reviewers said it was to strong in the bottle it is indeed.  After using it is not as strong.  2nd lets address  ""it dryed my hair out""  I did not have this experience my hair ONLY EVER had shine if I oiled it , I looked at my hair after shampooing twice and conditioning once and it was shiny , oh my this was amazing!  My longest hair at the back of my head clumps when wet , as I said over processed.  This still happened after shampooing and conditioning with this product.  The shampoo is rich and silky and felt more like conditioner than the conditioner did.  The conditioner is thick but is not creamy and slippery as I am used to most conditioners feeling.  I was worried that this would mean my hair would feel brittle and not soft when it dried.  I was pleasantly surprised that my curls were curlier and the SHINE !  I could have cried it has been 30 plus years since my hair has been shiny with nothing but shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is sooo soft and silky this is incredible to me 30 years of trying every product imaginable and my hair has NEVER been this soft.  I do not blow dry I have always let my hair dry naturally.  Hope this review helps anyone in doubt.  I have thin easily weighed down hair (this is why I perm) this product did not weigh my hair down.  The picture is what was my most dry ,brittle straw like ends.  This is what they looked like after 1 use.  Very pleased."
12,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,matted my hair/ read ingredient list,"Hair type: 4a/ low porosity. I really wanted to like this product. Unfortunately this product line matted/ dried out my hair. I could not detangle/ comb through. I tried the entire product line (shampoo, conditioner, masque) and followed the directions listed. I used consistently for about 2-3 months just to make sure it was the product and not me doing something incorrectly. Same issue. FYI, for those with low porosity hair you might want to check the ingredient list on the back. I know that some people with low type of porosity have a sensitivity to protein. I noticed their is hydrolyzed rice protein in some/ most of Shea Moisture products and it may be why my hair reacted so badly. Hope this can someone else!!"

14,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Left “stuff” on my hair.,"I was using Nature’s Gate shampo and conditioner; however with them going out of business I had to find something to switch to. This came up as a suggested product on Amazon.The poduct came fast and in complete packaging without leaks.I noticed right away that the shampoo left some “stuff” on my hair after rinsing. My hair did not feel clean. The conditioner made my hair feel soft and it felt hydrated. About a week into using it, I started getting pimples on my scalp. I stopped using it and the pimples healed and went away immediately. I’m glad it works for others, it didn’t work for me."
15,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm used to using other products,"I used this one because I'm transitioning and it was the most recommended. I had hard water so it didn't take to my hair at first. After I got a water filter, it took better to my hair. Although, the generic Paul Mitchell tea tree conditioner I was using was much softer for my hair than this product. I'm thinking of switching back. This product did moisturize my hair but not nearly as much as my old conditioner. I usually have to leave 90% of the conditioner in my hair for it to absorb it the way I want. Even still, my hair would still be dry by the end of the day no matter how many moisturizing products i put in after wash and conditioning. I was disappointed that I switched to this brand because of the way my hair doesn't absorb it the way it did my generic brand. I was looking for something more natural and better for transitioning hair, but this didn't completely fulfill my expectations. I still required a lot more moisturizing products than what I'm used to.Don't get me wrong, it did do its job, just not 100%. It meet about 70% of my expectations. It's not entirely bad, but just not for my hair."
16,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it!!!!!!,Left my hair so soft and after deep conditioning my hair it even enhanced my curl pattern which doesn’t always happen
17,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Completely strips my hair,"I'm not sure if this product is intended to strip your hair of all oils, but it really does for me. I've been using this for about three weeks now and my hair is SO dry. After using the shampoo/conditioner my usually smooth hair feels dry and haylike. Trying to brush my hair afterwards is a nightmare, because it's SO dry it gets extremely matted and tangled. Lastly, this shampoo strips my hair so much that it's pulling the dye out of my hair. I normally only have to dye my hair once every 2-3 months and that's usually just to touch up the roots only (even when using store brand sulfate shampoos). This has turned my hair from red to orange in three weeks. Definitely not the shampoo/conditioner for me."
18,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,I had to cut my hair after using!,I was really excited to try these products but it ended in disaster. The first time I used both of them my hair ended up very tangled . I thought it was just user error. The second time I used both the shampoo and conditioner it literally fused my hair at the ends!!! I couldn’t detangle it at all. It was like it had glue mixed it with the products. I literally had to cut all my hair off!!! Ladies I’m talking shoulder length hair to like cut at my scalp!  I was so upset I thought I had a product that would work great for my 4c hair . I wasn’t trying to go for a hair cut!
19,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great other than shipping, few pumps of conditioner squirted out.","I have been having problems finding a great shampoo for my fine, 3a/3b curly blonde hair that also works for my scalp. I'm a woman ""of a certain age (45)"" on HRT who also has some pretty extreme bouts of eczema. My scalp, since ""the change"" has decided to join the eczema party as well. I don't put products at my roots, and I only use a leave-in conditioner and flaxseed gel for styling. However, by the end of the day after I wash my hair, my scalp is itching like mad. I tried a different shampoo before this one mainly because of the reviews of the items arriving damaged. But the other shampoo/conditioner didn't do the trick, so I decided to give this a try. It's amazing, and I'm glad I did try it, however, it did come open during shipping and the conditioner squirted all over the inside. About 3 pumps worth. However, I am really loving the product, and after just 2 washes I notice a huge difference in my scalp and my hair. It works awesome for my curls and I can wash my hair every other day without scratching all night the night before I shower. I'm pleased, and I recommend!"
20,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not so great,Was hoping for a great new product to try with more natural Ingredients but didn’t have a good experience here. First the package arrived damaged and the shampoo was leaking but I just let it go. After many uses I realized the product was leaving heavy residue in my hair. I thought maybe I wasn’t rinsing properly but not the case after several washes. It leaves a heavy feel in my hair and makes my hair look dark and dirty when it is in fact clean. The smell isn’t the best either and the bottles are teeny tiny. I won’t be repurchasing.
21,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,it was like I had a new head of hair,"I was looking for a product that would get rid of product buildup. Prior to using Shea moisturizer, after showering, my hair felt sticky and would look greasy when dry. After my first use with Shea moisturizer, my wet hair felt incredibly soft.  And after I dried it, it was like I had a new head of hair. I’m in love with this set.  It smells like it’s would be good enough to eat. The only con, and it’s very minor, is that the shampoo doesn’t lather up a lot. I had a hard time feeling like it was getting to my scalp. But otherwise, 5 stars all the way. I’ll definitely be buying more when I start to run low."
22,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing but leaves a bit of a film on my hair always,"This set contains some fig scent and it's amazing. My hair smells so nice in and out of the shower. But I have been underwhelmed with how my hair feels when I use this product. It usually feels like it didn't quite rinse out all the way, like someone forgot to rinse the conditioner out or something. I have tried using much less, tried rinsing more, tried rinsing in cold, tried it with and without a hair dryer afterwards, etc. It always has a kind of waxy feel that isn't very nice. I do live in the south and it's very humid. But I have had this same trouble with other varieties of Shea Moisture products and I don't have it with some other brands.If you generally get on with this brand, though, this one smells SO good. I'm really sad it isn't working out for me."
23,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,"EXCELLENT product for dry, bleached, curly or fine hair","First, this stuff smells absolutely AMAZING. Next, it has worked wonders on smoothing and conditioning my 12-year old son's shoulder length curly hair (he's a rock band drummer ;) It has also worked wonders on smoothing and moisturizing my platinum bleached, fine hair. I've noticed A LOT less breakage and a bunch of new growth around my hairline. I highly recommend this product for anyone that has curly, fine, bleached or just generally dry/frizzy hair."
24,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but regrattably not for me.,"This is a great shampoo and conditioner combination for my type 4 combination high porosity hair.Didn't too much care for the texture of the shampoo but once the conditioner hits your hair, it makes up for it. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a strong scent that I didn't care too much for.I would have easily continued using these because of how moisturized and soft they made my hair but one (or more) of the ingredients leaves my face and neck with a rash every time I use it.While I won't continue using, I will recommend trying these products given how great they make your hair feel."
25,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a product that WORKS for natural black hair.,"I have natural kinky hair and usually wear a twist out or basic Afro. When I washed my hair in the past I had difficulty managing it to style and care for my scalp. The first time I used this shampoo, I was able to immediately feel how soft my hair was. I could run a comb through it. Then I conditioned and rinsed and my kink looked amazing. Still kinky (as I wanted) but my curls had BODY. I could part and twist with no resistance or much breakage when styled wet or dry. I wash every 9 days and my hair is thriving. It's no longer dry and my ends are properly moisturized."
26,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,Spilled in the bag a little.,"The two of them were together in a vacuum sealed piece of plastic.  Unfortunately some of the conditioner managed to get out of the bottle and were all over them, but it wasn't very much and the plastic was enough to keep it from getting on anything else in the box.So far it's working as intended and I think it's doing a little better for my hair than my last shampoo/conditioner combination, but I have really difficult hair so it's not a complete solution.  It smells nice and doesn't leave any residue as far as I can tell, and I tend to use a lot of it.  I don't know how well it works if you use it as a leave-in conditioner, it doesn't really seemed designed for that so I just put it on first thing and then wash it out before I leave the shower."
27,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,This brand is going downhill fast!,"The scent is the only amazing thing about these products. I have 4A type hair. This mess turned my hair 4C. The shampoo felt like it was stripping my hair when I was washing it, I thought the conditionioner would make up for that. My hair has never been so dry and unmanageable. My leave in conditioners couldn't even moisten my hair after I used this. I always air dry my hair after putting in a leave in conditioner. This routine leaves my curls soft and bouncy. After using this shampoo and conditioner combo in my routine, my hair was crunchy and dry. I'm throwing this crap in the garbage. I don't want my daughter to ruin her beautiful hair like I did mine."
28,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's Everything!,"I use Shea Moisture's other line, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Line for damaged hair, I really liked that, but I find that the Intense Hydration line works better for my hair. It's more manageable (sleek, moisturized). It smells sooo good! It's everything. I wish there was more in the bottle though. Their Jamaican Black Castor set usually comes with more product in the bottle. I have kinky afro textured hair, but I'm sure it'll work for anyone needing more moisture and/or hydration."
29,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! It Destroys your hair; word of mouth Advertising is EXTREMELY MISLEADING,"The absolute WORST product for my hair. Deceitful word of mouth, has been doing their advertising. DONT believe the HYPE. This product  will DESTROY your hair. Your hair will become brittle, extremely dry and DULL"
30,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very Mild,"I really would give this shampoo and conditioner 3.5 stars.  It is good gentle shampoo, lathers oaky and has a nice scent.  My only con to these products is that they did not keep my hair clean for long.  For some reason, my hair was dirty the next day and I don't like washing it everyday.  I usually wash every other day, which I thought was healthier for my hair.  So, having said all of that I think this shampoo and conditioner does not strip your hair of its natural oils so that is a big plus.  I am happy with this shampoo and conditioner as very mild and gentle on my thin hair."
31,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not my cup of tea,"This is just not a good product for my hair, especially the shampoo.  It leaves a very heavy waxy film (sp?) on my hair.  It is so heavy that I could not even dry my hair all the way with my hairdryer - the wax covered my wet hair (especially close to the scalp/at the roots) and trapped the moisture in.  My hair at the scalp felt super coarse and oily and left a residue on my hand.  Now, I know how to rinse out my hair and I actually try to use very little shampoo, so it's not like I put on too much product and didn't rinse properly.  It took a good 2-3 shampoos with head and shoulders shampoo to get the film off of my hair.  I've tried other SheaMoisture products, but this was one was so different and I returned it right away."
32,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too Drying,"I use a lot of SheaMoisture products. I've had great luck with body wash and lotions, but no luck with hair products. I have tried many hair product options and have been disappointed. This one was no exception. I found this product dried out my hair. It did not leave it soft at all and when left to air dry or blow dry, the result was a mount of frizz. I was hoping the manuka honey and mafura oil would provide intensive moisture, but for my hair - which was only slightly damaged from color and heating tools became drier, more frizzy and took on a severely damaged appearance, and left it feeling like straw."
33,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl.

I have 4A hair and I have always struggled to keep my hair hydrated. Since I have been using this product I have seen a lot of progress in my hair. It looks healthy and is growing since it's not breaking off. The product has a great smell as well!"

Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!!!,"I recently had been using an awful shampoo and conditioner that was making my hair fall out, so while doing some research online I found this brand. Immediately looking at the reviews I see the mixed reactions, I also notice that this shampoo and conditioner are made for type 4 hair, which I do not have. Also while looking at the review I see that this is a cleansing shampoo/conditioner so it will take all of the things that drug store shampoos/conditioners make your hair shiny out. I took a chance on this and after a few washes I notice my hair is still soft and smooth (I’ve had it about 2 weeks). It gives my hair great volume, leaves it moisturized but not greasy, and looks great between washes longer than any other shampoo/conditioner combination I have ever used before. Also my hair is no longer falling out (thank goodness)! I HIGHLY recommend this product!"

I love that because my hair is nice!!Get this if you have wavey or curly hair and I promise you you'll be satisfied.

When we first bought it, we had more of his old shampoo left over but when we ran out of the old shampoo, I was reluctant to use something new. I just did a quick wash with this shampoo, and I was completely blown away at how soft and hydrated his hair was! And the scent is lovely! We will never use anything else."

It's about 4-5 inches long.Starting with the shampoo, it's pretty mild, but great at getting rid of buildup. It only takes 1 shampoo to get my scalp clean. It doesn't leave my hair too dry either.The conditioner worked well too! It left my hair fragrant and soft. Rather moisturized as well."
41,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely saved my hair!,"I have been bleaching my hair for 20+ years and as such, they were in rough shape. Very thin, breaking constantly, no amount of trimming would prevent split ends, and absolutely no shine. Shea products changed that immediately! Gave my hair that rescue it desperately needed. My hair is slowly transforming and never looked better. Note to those with thin hair: since it provides so much moisture, it can make your hair a bit oily quite fast, however nothing dry shampoo can’t fix. Also, you can apply the conditioner to the ends only to prevent that. But trust me, you will love this combo if your hair is truly desperate for cure :))"

The SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner has made my hair soft, shiny and bouncy! : )  I am going on 70 years old and my hair is fine with a little natural waviness.  Even though  I don't use dyes, hairspray or heated styling tools my hair started feeling dry and becoming frizzy.  After using these products my hair now looks sleek and has weight to it.  As mentioned previously, it has a bounce to it and after using spongy rollers my hair keeps the curl.  FABUULOUS!! Thank you. : ) Joanne"

First time I used this shampoo and conditioner, it was fine, but now, by the third or fourth time, my hair feels rather dry. Not really keen on the scent, either, as it tends toward a strong musk, and I prefer citrusy or floral scents."

My hair has minimal heat tool exposure and is naturally processed with henna hair dye from Lush. Dry hair and some dry scale as of lately. I swim in the pool so some sun and bleach exposure recently. I use soft scrunches to tie my hair.The conditioner leaves my hair flat at the top and dry at the bottom even if you only use 1 pump and only put at the bottom of my hair. I have more split ends but not sure why. If you have thick dry hair than this is perfect but if you have fine to medium hair this may be too heavy for you. It was for me."

Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, left my hair soft and moisturized","I like all of this line of shampoo and conditioner and they are the only one I use. This is not my favorite of this brand but its still very good- moisturizing with healthy ingredients, just did not give me the body I need for my fine hair, but still is great.

Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but low on scent,"I love how these products make my hair feel!  My only complaint is the size of the bottles and the scent.  The scent is too subtle. I was hoping for a very fragrant scent. That being said, no scent is better than a terrible or over powering one.  Second, the bottle seemed on the small side. The actual product felt great, lathered well and left my hair feeling very hydrated."

After all I tried for my dense low porosity 4c hair (which we all know is one of the driest hair types) I used Cantu, Creme of Nature, etc, but nothing comes close to how soft and moisturized this product left my hair. And the conditioner smells AMAZING. Everything else usually would leave my hair feeling stripped, dry, and tangled, but this is definitely coming through. The definition I seen in my curls after using just the shampoo kinda blew my mind lol. The reviews did scare me a bit, but hey, everyone's hair reacts to things differently, and mine just so happen to love it. Issa yes."

Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,This shampoo and conditioner has done AMAZING things for her hair,"I purchased this for mine and my 4 year old's curly hair, trying to add some moisture. While my hair feels healthier, it holds water forever after I wash now, it feels greasy as soon as it dries. My 4 year old's hair feels crunchy and gunky when it dries.However, my 6 year old has stone straight, stringy hair that frequently gets a frizzy spot in the back moments after its brushed. This shampoo and conditioner has done AMAZING things for her hair. It's smooth, feels healthier, and stays polished looking after its brushed. Her hair does not feel greasy or gunky in the slightest. I suppose it's all about the hair type. I will definitely continue purchasing it for her and will be recommending it to her grandmother who has similar hair."

Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,I was having dry scalp problems but after one wash and condition with this I was so much better!

65,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ehh,I think that for the right person this product might work well but for my wavy hair it seemed very heavy and the smell was overpowering and unappealing.

Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,VERY moisturizing-,"I think it is a great product overall, though in my opinion it really is for dry hair. It is very moisturizing. If  your hair is already oily prone, I would not recommend it. smells great and using a little hair conditioning especially on the ends feels very nice on my hair. My hair is not oily prone but I have to be mindful of the amount I use so it does not get oily."

Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Shea Moisture line ever.,This is the favorite Shea Moisture line ever. The shampoo is so moisturizing. My hair feels wonderful and soft when finished. The conditioner is just as wonderful. I don’t experience a lot of shedding. There is a light scent. When I’m done my hair is super soft and not dry or stripped like some other shampoo/conditioners. The products are thick.
70,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected.,"In all fairness I have to say “it comes down to personal preference and lack of fulfillment for the customer”. Its not bad just not what I expected.  It takes a little while for the suds so be sure your hair is very wet and you’ll use less. It’s very rich in suds once it gets going. Could be expensive in the long run for thick, long hair."

Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,About to scratch a hole in my head.,This product made my hair/scalp worse. I first purchased this item because based on the reviews it will help with my itchy scalp. NOPE it didn't help it actually made it worse. I feel like I'm about to scratch a hole in my head. My hair feels like when you been swimming in the pool and get out it has that rough sticky texture.... yes that's how my hair feels now. I wish I can get my money back for this crap.

Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for my curls.,I'm a caucasian male with some pretty tight ringlet-curls. This is the 1st conditioner I've used that actually feels like it moisturizes my hair.

76,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far it’s great!,My hair is a mess right now and on the road to moisture recovery but after one wash I noticed a big difference especially being able to brush thru my hair with little to no tangles. I’m still forming my option on it but so far so good! Also the smell is amazing and lingers on your hair for a long time.
77,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl.

I’ve had relaxers for years, and I’m attempting to transition to natural hair. I’ve had this product for about two weeks and I’m happy. The scent is amazing. My new growth is soft. I can actually run my fingers through my hair. I’d recommend this ."
78,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big fan,I changed to this set after using really cheap stripping shampoos (like the $2 Suave bottles) I noticed a difference after the first wash with an increase of softness and decrease of frizz. My waves are much more uniform. I'm excited to see the difference after more consecutive uses.
79,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells nice BUT,"I loved the smell of this duo and bought it because I’ve heard so many good things about it but it didn’t make my hair soft, moisturized, shiny or anything good. My hair ended up being frizzy and straw like. Probably not the right kind for my hair type but I definitely wasn’t happy with the results."
80,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells good, defines curls without weighing down.",So far I am IN LOVE with this duo. It makes my hair shiny and soft and textures without weighing it down and making it greasy. My only advice would be to keep rinsing a little longer even after you think it’s all out. My husband who is black and has super curly hair also loves it for HIS hair. I love that we only need one shampoo and conditioner for us both. If you have thin hair I’m not sure you would have the same results...but as for us with thicker and curly hair. It’s amazing!! And smells great.
81,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,"No more ""Fragrance"" please!!","So, this is just my experience, but I've been staying away from most Shampoos for about 5 years now. For a long time I used stuff only scented with Essential oils, but I decided to try this stuff. Now, it my fault because I didn't pay attention to this having fragrance oils as the main scent. BUT, I didn't think it would be this strong... The smell is good, don't get me wrong. It's been years since my hair has smelled good so I enjoyed that aspect, but every time I use this product I wake up with asthma at night. I haven't changed anything else... So this is all I can think of that is causing it- fragrance can cause people to have asthma attacks in general. So, while everything else about the product seems great, I used it for about 6 days and my hair is soft and it has stopped falling out/breaking off as much (that will be the topic of my review of another brand of shampoo, haha!), but as soon as I stop using the stuff I can sleep without waking up to clogged airways. Otherwise, seems like a decent product, just wish they'd take out the fragrance!  So, again, this is my experience, I have no idea if it will cause anyone else to have problems, but I just can't give it a good rating if it causes this much of an issue for me."
82,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for me,"Using my boyfriend's account here. I have long 3A/3B type hair and was hoping this would help make my hair be healthier and repair the damage, however, it did not work for me. It made my hair frizzy and did not moisturize it. I wanted to return it but decided I would stick through with it and see if it made a difference but it did not. Maybe it depends on the person but for me it was a waste of money."
83,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thick hair,"This product is amazing for one daughter and not so great for the other.

84,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not the best scent, don't know if it's worth it","I really dislike the scent, I used it once and I said nope not for me.

85,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Make sure to get the formula with essential oils.,I noticed a huge difference by the 3rd wash. My hair was less frizzy and more soft.

86,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl.

I have 4c natural hair and I tend to feel the difference in my hair after products. The shampoo made my hair feel really soft and clean. While other shampoos make my hair feel dry, I didn’t know shampoo was capable of making hair feel so soft. And the conditioner was great too, I didn’t feel as if it made my hair as soft though."

115,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,These products are a natural hair treasure!,"These products are for those who want to wear their hair curly. The shampoo cleans really well, but the conditioner softens and detangles the hair making it manageable. I’ve been using these for about 2 years and love them. If you decide to wear your hair straight after using these products, I’d advise combing the curls completely out and roller setting or braiding it down to air dry. Blow drying seems to make the hair dry and brittle. Air drying locks in the moisture."

382,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,HORRIBLE CHEMICAL FRAGRANCE THAT GAVE ME AN AWFUL HEADACHE!,"For anyone that is sensitive to chemicals and fragrances, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! I ordered this shampoo and conditioner because the description said it was all natural and the fragrance was from essential oils. When I looked at the label later I realized this is untrue as it states fragrance in the ingredients. It took me a full week to get the stench out of my hair and that was only after shampooing it about 10 times, and that includes twice with scent blocking shampoos!! None of those worked so then I soaked my hair in olive oil so I couldn't smell the horrible fragrance. When I rinsed that out I could still smell it so I soaked it with olive oil again. Then I rinsed it, shampooed, covered in baking soda and rinsed in apple cider vinegar. When I got out of the shower I couldn't smell it as badly, but once my hair dried it was super stinky again. I even drove around in our Jeep for an hour, hoping the wind would blow the stench out! My husband who is not sensitive could barely stand to be around me. The smell was so strong that any time I would move at night it would wake me up!!! It gave me the worst headache. You have to wonder what in the world they are putting in it to make the smell last so long. Definitely nothing natural!!!! Extremely disgusted with this product!"

597,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product if your hair has oil but skip this one if your hair is dry,"This product did not work well for my hair but my daughter loves it for hers.  I have naturally blonde, fine, curly hair and oil is basically non-existent on my hair.  I need something that really moisturizes.  I love their soaps as they really make my skin feel great and I thought this product would do for my hair what the soap does for my skin.  Unfortunately, my hair was ok after first use, dry after the second and horrible after the third use.  My daughter has oilier hair so I gave the product to her to try.  She loves it.  She says her hair feels great.  I will say the smell is amazing.  So my recommendation would be if you have hair that has oil for this to work with you will love it.  If your hair is dry, try another product."

When I used the shampoo for the 1st time did expect a greater lather so I kept applying more. After continual use, I realized it wasn't necessary. I researched which product to use for my hair type prior to purchase. After reading the reviews I think some people didn't research before applying to their hair type, hence some experiencing disappointing results."

Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,If you want to see more hair in the shower than on your head this product is for you,"I have used this product exactly two times and I will tell you this is the most horrible thing I have ever washed my hair with. I thought it would moisturizer my hair and all it did was dry my hair out and make it so unmanageable that I can't even comb my hair with a wide tooth comb. I don't know who this product was made for but it sure  wasn't made for my extra curly 4c hair. If I could return it I would but I have already used it twice, only to see if it would get better (it didn't). Also, and I thing this is the most important thing, it made my hair fall out!!!! I wouldn't give this to my worse enemy, well maybe worst enemy because I'm petty like that."

Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Bundle Pack,"I've been using this product for two weeks now and I must say, it is quite moisturizing when used in conjunction with other products. The key to this (as with any other hair routine) is to lock in that moisture.Pros: Smells great, not too strong. Lives up to the ""intense moisture"" claim. No harsh stripping of the hair follicles. Lightweight on hair.Cons: small-ish bottles.Overall, great bundle package for the price, and will probably be purchasing again as Summertime approaches."

633,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mmm honey,"Can my hair being too soft be an issue?I really like this shampoo and conditioner combo. My hair is very very soft after I use this stuff and although that's what most people desire, I can't get as much volume as I'd like. If you're looking to control frizzy curls, this stuff works great. If you need a bit of frizz to keep your style, then this works a little too well. Now I need more product to achieve my signature look, but it's worth it.I like this combo much more than the coconut/hibiscus one. The shampoo actually lathers when I use it and the conditioner does a great job at detangling and moisturizing afterward. And although this might be arbitrary to the experience, the smell is AMAZING. It smells like honey and oil: very fragrant but not overwhelming.I've only used it a couple of times so far, but so far I'm pretty happy with the results. Also, at $10 each, I think it's a great deal."

This is the BEST set I've tried my hair is extremely dry n damaged from heat and in the past doing relaxers. Ive always used treseme,garniar,dove, suave etc. But for me it was OK for the moment but Nothing compares to this exactly what my hair needed. It was soft smooth and detangled after it dried that was rare for me . I also purchased the hair Mask thing basically it's a deep conditioning you rinse off after like 10 min.

It does not take a bunch of product for outstanding results.  I wash every other day and roots only, then follow with conditioner, ends only. On days no wash, still use conditioner on the ends. My hair stylist has commented on the improved health of my hair. Even after years of over processing! Not a highly scented product and can tell the higher quality over store brands and many salon brands. Highly, highly recommended!"

664,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Heavenly scent of the tropics,"I bought this set after reading some very positive reviews.  My hair is very thick and leans toward being coarse.  I used this for the first time after being in the hospital for several days.  My hair desperately needed a shampoo.  After the first lather, my hair felt clean and soft, but I wanted to be sure, so I lathered up again.  My hair felt really good then!  I like the consistency of the shampoo as well as that heavenly scent.  Men could easily use this product, and I hope some do.  The conditioner leaves a bit to be desired, but it's okay.  It's not as thick as I would have liked, and it didn't quite smooth my hair out as much as I would have liked.  That said, I will continue to use it.  I really liked the fact that the pump on the conditioner locks so it can be taken when travelling.  I wonder why they didn't put one on the shampoo?"

672,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,SCENT IS GIVING ME A HEADACHE! Way too strong.,THE SMELL IS SO STRONG IT'S GIVING ME A HEADACHE! I used this for the first time 7 hours ago and the scent is still incredibly strong. I have to say that this was a complete waste there's no way i'll ever be able to use this again. My hair feels clean and soft so I understand the beauty award but for someone with a sensitive nose and head I would steer clear from these products.

675,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dry Over-processed Hair,"My hair has been lightened fried and cook in the sun then dyed black so over the years my hair has had its share of over-processing so I am giving it a break. I originally found the intensive hydration moisturizer in Wal-Mart so I figured that I will give it a try once I opened this product the lovely scent of frankincense and myrrh hit my nose and I fell in love with this product I applied it to my hair and my hair loved it, it made my hair so soft I couldn't believe it my hard crispy fry ends were so moisturized and soft it felt like my old hair again so with that being said this is now my product of choice ....I just wish it was in a larger bottle."
676,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,2.0 out of 5 stars,"May Work For Some, But Not For My Fine, Wavy Hair","I purchased these based on reviews and am unfortunately disappointed. I have finely textured, naturally wavy hair. I hate the way this feels while shampooing. I hate the way my hair feels after it dries. It's not the product for me.I thought this product would replace my Bumble and Bumble Gentle or my Surface Trinity and it isn't going to work out."
677,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Will this work on 2c hair?,"I recently purchased this item, and i was hearing how using products that are not for your hair type could make your hair fall out. I really want to try this product but i'm really nervous, if anyone can let me know if it'd be okay that'd be great thank you :)"
678,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not cleaning, breakage, frizz, doesn't wash out","I used this for over a year, because I tend to have skin reactions to a lot of stuff and had started getting an itchy scalp. I finally got so frustrated by the amount of breakage and frizz in my hair from this, so I switched to a mainstream brand which claims to have less added bs (ever pure). After one use of a different brand, I was blown away by how horrible this product line was for my hair. It also never seemed to wash out, always having bubbles leftover in the tub after Conditioning. I've also noticed that I now don't need to wash my hair as much because it's ACTUALLY getting cleaned by using a different brand finally. I feel so poorly leaving such a bad review, but also tried other variations from this brand and they were equally bad. I can say I do love the body wash, which is why I gave the hair products a try. Please consider the body wash and other products, but this was worse than I had thought. It left me feeling like I needed more crap in my hair to fix the frizz and breakage, which then never got washed out and built up. 😔"
679,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Causes major buildup!,"I have a ton of hair, very curly but fine (i’m caucasian - italian) in texture and i was working on fixing my curl pattern postpartum - at first this really helped manage the new frizz i had but the amount of buildup was terrible!! after 4 weeks i wouldn’t even have to use product to style my hair because my curls had a sticky gel like texture. Forget about blow drying it! It looked super greasy. If you do use it i suggest taking a break once a week to use clarifying shampoo. Hope this helps!"
680,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,The best one ever. 6 of 5 stars
681,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my mixed course curls,"Leaves your hair moisturized, bouncy and light. Smells amazing and doesn't take much to get the job done. I now can rock my natural curl pattern without weighing it down with heavy products."
682,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was terrible. I had to use a curling iron to ...,"This conditioner saved my naturally curly hair. My hair started to get dry and the curls started to straighten out and look frizzy. It was terrible. I had to use a curling iron to fix all the half straight parts, which then dried out my hair more. I started using this conditioner after a saw how shiny and silky it made a friend of mine's hair. Her hair is thick and curly like mine. I have to say, it changed my hair. I don't need to curl it anymore. Because my hair is so thick, after I rinse it out, I leave in an ever so small amount just to keep the curls soft and protect from the diffuser heat. It just needed the hydration that this product provided. Once a week I use the hair mask while I shower for extra hydration. I have recommended it to all my friends with thick, curly hair."
683,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Left hair greasy and unmanageable,"I purchased this shampoo and conditioner after dying my hair for the first time and getting a keratin treatment.  I was told I should look for something sulfate-free, and this product seemed like a great fit.  Except after 2.5 months of using it, I can confidently say this product RUINED my hair.  I naturally have thick, voluminous hair, and after using this product I would constantly be left with greasy, oily, flaky, unmanageable hair that kept falling and wouldn't calm down.  I could never wear my formerly fun and curly hair down...always tied it up because it was that bad.  I thought for a while that it was because I died my hair and my hair was damaged.  But after finally switching to another product, my problems subsided.  Maybe this shampoo won't affect everyone the same way, but once I switched, I realized that it made my hair the worst it has ever been."
684,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,USED not New,"Sorry it has taken me a while to post a review, but both my bottle of shampoo and conditioner were used.  No seal on top of shampoo, plunger in conditioner and around top of bottle had dried conditioner.  BOTH bottles were down by a quarter to a third and you could see the 'squeeze' mark on the shampoo container.  Unfortunately, it is too late for me to return.  Next time I'll look closer before assuming I was delivered a new and unused product."
685,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great moisturizer/had a reaction,"I have dry natural hair and I wanted to try this shampoo and conditioner because of the high reviews. I was a little disappointed by the smell. It kind of had a bitter smell to me and I’m used to using coconut smelling hair products. I saw one review that said it made their scalp itch a lot and I didn’t think much of it. After I got out of the shower, my scalp was itching a lot like I was having an allergic reaction. So be mindful about that. For the positives, my hair was very soft and moisturized. Due to the scalp irritation, I won’t be using this product anymore which really bums me out because my hair felt amazing after I used it."
686,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair super oily,Maybe I just have the wrong type of hair for this product. I typically use the Shea Moisture jamaican black castor oil product line and I love them so much. Thought I'd give this one a try but it left my hair feeling super greasy and weighed down. I wont be using this again and am going back to my other shea moisture products that work much better for me.
687,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves a film in hair!,"I started using the shampoo and conditioner together for about a week. The first day, I let my hair air dry and i noticed that it left a gunky film in my hair. At first I thought that maybe I didnt fully rinse the product out. I then tried again a couple of days later and the same thing. My hair was getting all bunched up and tangled from this. My hair just felt tangly, heavy, and gunky. I loved the smell and it did revive my hair a little, but it felt gross from the film it was leaving."
688,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,I use this brand a lot. I have thick hair and have always had an issue with products. This brand is amazing. I have yet to find one of their products I don't like. This shampoo and conditioner specifically leaves my hair extremely soft and easier to deal with. Even my boyfriend uses it and he has fairly thin hair.
689,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great products!,"I love this combo.  Shea Moisture is a great brand and this set is great for dry, damaged hair, leaving it soft and manageable.  I love that they are paraben and sulfate-free.  I did take off a star, however, for the conditioner.  I love it, but it is so very rich and thick, I nearly pop a vessel getting it out of the bottle.  It needs a pump, I think!"
690,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Baby soft hair!,If you have curly hair than its lacking moister. Other shampoos claim they give moister but they are filled with harmful chemicals that strip your hair and damages your hair and sulfate which absorbs moisture. This is the only shampoo that has actually made my hair soft. My hair feels baby hair soft. I love it and I love the smell and it lasts for days. I've never had a shampoo that kept my hair smelling so good for so long. I'm hooked and I'm never going back.
691,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used! I have super thick, dry, frizzy red hair. The conditioner adds so much moisture and it smells so good! The only problem is that is can weigh my hair down and look a bit greasy. But I can just spray in some dry shampoo and that helps. I love this stuff!"
692,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Waste money. Low porosity, 2C","This did nothing for my low porosity, 2C hair. Absolutely nothing."
693,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for my 4C hair!,"I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for almost a year and it gives my low-porosity 4C hair life!! Moisturizes and it doesn't strip my hair of its natural oils. I also use the deep conditioner and it's one of the best deep conditioners I've used. If you are lucky, Target sell 50% more bottles of the shampoo and conditioner! They are 19.5 ounces! Be on the look-out."
694,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t recommend,"Ugh. Worst hair products ever.

698,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the smell!,"First of all, I didn't buy this on Amazon, I bought it at Target for about $10 each, so it's cheaper there and you don't have to wait to get it. Second of all, the smell this shampoo leaves in my hair is amazing. It almost smells like I've used a conventional shampoo and conditioner which are chemically designed to smell good, but this one is all natural. I love it and my hair feels so soft! Highly recommend trying it out for yourself. The coconut hibiscus one is also one of my favorites."
699,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,For thick coils and 4c hair!,I have 4c very thick hair and I was able to comb thru with the shampoo. I would highly reccomend this to those with 4c course hair!
700,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite shampoo and conditioner,My favorite shampoo.  I have a thyroid condition that causes my hair to be dry and brittle. This shampoo and conditioner hydrates so well that my hair is finally able to grow past my shoulder.  I love the way it smells.
701,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, be caution of negative reviews",This shampoo works wonders on natural curly hair for African Americans! It made my hair so soft and bouncy and cleaned my scalp and hair and did not leave behind any residue. It would help if the people who had issues would identify themselves or their hair type. Black hair absorbs moisture so shampoos geared toward black hair will leave other hair types greasy. This is not the fault of the shampoo. It is designed and works as intended! It left my hair and scalped so moisturized.
702,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,... this shampoo and conditioner set at Walmart and I LOVE the way it smells,"I bought this shampoo and conditioner set at Walmart and I LOVE the way it smells. I have fine textured strait hair but lots of it and it makes it so soft. I can't say enough good things about this brand as it is and you all just wowed me with another great product line.Things to keep in mind if you're a new customer switching over from commercial shampoo brands:Your hair is going to go through a 1-2 week detox period if you're used to using brands like Pantene or Treseme. It might feel heavier at first but pretty soon it will feel normal again and much healthier.If you shampoo, you must condition with the conditioner. I've tried using just the shampoo and my hair doesn't feel right.Make sure you lather and rinse your head thoroughly with both products or you may get a built up feeling. I use a pick to ensure that I've covered my whole head.Hope this helps!"

715,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved My Very Dry Hair From Winter Cold,"I was a bit worried as I impulse bought this and seen some people say it weighs their hair down or makes it greasy/leaves a film. I have 1b hair and I know this is meant for curly hair, but I’m honestly glad I bought this. I live in Minnesota and the harsh cold literally sucks all the moisture out of my hair and makes it feel like straw. It’s made my hair so much more hydrated and manageable again. Doesn’t weight it down or make it greasy or a weird film. The scent is amazing too! So happy with the outcome but I don’t think I can use this outside winter. I think it’ll definitely leave my hair greasy but who knows. I’ll update the review later if I remember :)"
716,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,5.0 out of 5 stars,TURN BACK THE CLOCK ON YOUR HAIR!,"This product works wonders! I’m 51 with color treated hair that has become coarse with age. I’m of Mediterranean decent and have a natural wave to my hair. Unfortunately over the last several years those waves have become coarse and dry. This product has worked magic! Its has added moisture, shine, softness and manageability! The other thing that is great about it is that it breaks down buildup on your hair while managing to do the impossible, make your hair look and feel younger! I was skeptical but my daughter insisted we try it because it’s a very healthy formula. I can’t see me using anything else now that I’ve found it. I use the shampoo and conditioner and I really love it!"
717,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,1.0 out of 5 stars,Regret buying this,Made my hair unmanageable and brittle. I regret buying this product. I also wasted money buying the hydrating mask. I tried twice to see if maybe it was because I just took my hair out but the second time I lost more hair and I don’t usually get breakage or loss of hair. I attached pics after the hair was balled up. After I washed the second time. First was from one side and I thought that was it and I couldn’t believe how much hair was coming out so I took the other picture.

The packaging says that it is a family business.I recently found out that the company is owned by UNILEVER.Besides the fact,that the marketing is only a big lie to customers,Unilever is the biggest Company using palm oil and therefore is illegally clearing rainforests in Malaysia! That for, they are also not afraid to evict indigenous People from they’re forests and homes! I will never buy those products again and make sure to support companies which have morals and ethics! We have a responsibility, everyone of us can help to boycott such businesses and stop the destruction of our planet."

775,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Ok, so I have Mixed race hair and I come from a Spanish, Caribbean background predominantly, but also we have with Chinese, African and German mixed into my Caribbean family, so I have THICK spring coil curly hair - probably around a Type 4 Curly.I was using MIELLE products prior to the ""pandemic"" and they are Outstanding but were difficult to get a hold of online at the time, so I was apprehensive at first but, finding out SHEA Moisture are black owned and use Natural products boosted my trust in the brand.Im most of the way through the INTENSIVE HYDRATION - MANUKA HONEY set and my hair and scalp have loved all of it. Worst case, if you find the shampoo is stripping every bit of oil out of your hair, you can Add a little almond oil to it but either way, the Conditioner is fantastic in terms of Hair and Scalp treatment.I usually work it from roots, length and ends - tie my hair up - get out the shower - brush my teeth - body lotion, etc - maybe have a quick cuppa - and finally, I gently rinse the conditioner out of my hair and it smells Foopin AMAZING mate!HOWEVER, I found the Pump Cap on the conditioner bottle to be a little faulty - mine kept leaking conditioner after a few presses, but it did continue functioning throughout usage.ADVISE: Always price check this product - it goes up and down in price quite Wildly and it Is available more locally nowadays as well - Boots and Superdrug sell it as well as Black & Asian hair stores - but if the seller keeps a decent price (say £20ish) & the (Amazon) free delivery, this is Definitely worth having delivered and Shea Moisture have Loads of other great hair products too."

807,SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Shampoo & Conditioner | Set of 2 | 13 fl. Oz. each,Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Benutze die Kombi jetzt seit fast 2 Monaten und habe vielleicht etwa die Hälfte verbraucht. Ich habe zuvor bereits die coconut hibiscus Serie von Shea moisture ausprobiert, jedoch trotz der vielen tollen reviews war der mir der Geruch einfach viel zu intensiv und ich kann ihn auf Dauer auch immer noch nicht ertragen, obwohl es auch an sich ein Produkt mit toller Qualität ist.Deshalb habe ich mir die manuka honey Reihe bestellt und bin begeistert!Es versorgt mein Haar noch viel besser mit Feuchtigkeit als die coconut Linie. Es hat einen sehr leichten angenehmen Geruch nach feige und Honig, der sich auch nach dem waschen und nach dem auffrischen am nächsten Tag hält, ohne penetrant zu sein. Habe auch bereits Komplimente für den guten Duft bekommen. Das shampoo enthält Tenside, die auch in babyshampoo verwendet werden, ist also demnach sehr leicht und gut verträglich. Außerdem schäumt es auch in einem angenehmen Maße. Die Spülung topt das ganze aber. Ich lasse die gut über 5 Minuten auf dem kompletten Haar verteilt einwirken. Beim ausspülen fühlt sich mein Haar seidig glatt an, die Kämmbarkeit des nassen haars ist sehr einfach. Nach langen ausprobieren, habe ich so nach und nach wieder zu meinen gesunden naturlocken gefunden, die schön glänzen und ganz geschmeidig sind, kombiniert mit Leinsamengel erhalte ich ein tolles Ergebnis (würde mich selber ungefähr als 2c locken Typ einschätzen).Ich denke, die coconut Linie ist für mein haar vielleicht auch etwas zu schwer gewesen, funktioniert aber im Grunde auch ganz gut.Manuka honey von Shea moisture ist für die jenigen empfehlenswert, die nach einer tollen (locken) Pflege suchen, die das Haar gut hydriert. Das Produkt ist auf jeden Fall eine gute Alternative für alle, die sich zu den empfindlichen Nasen zählen und den ständigen Kokosnuss Geruch in sämtlichen Locken Produkten satt haben. Für mich war es gut investiertes Geld, die Kombi ist bei regelmäßiger Nutzung (alle 2-3 Tage) nach 2 Monaten zur Hälfte verbraucht, obwohl ich reichlich Produkt verwende.Tolles Produkt mit super Inhaltsstoffen!"

Meiner Meinung nach sind meine Haare nach der ca.20. Wäsche nicht wirklich hydrierter als bei den NoPoo Produkten von Deva Curl. Der Geruch ist absolut nicht meins und ist echt eine Qual (möchte die Produkte aber nicht wegschmeißen deswegen brauche ich sie auf) die jedes mal zu benutzen. Was aber am schlimmsten ist, ist dieses Produkt verknotet!! sehr dolle meine Wellen/Locken. Meine Haare sind vorher nicht wirklich verknotet, da ich fast nur einen Zopf trage aber beim shampoonieren verknoten sie und selbst mit dem Conditioner bekomme ich die nicht wirklich auseinander (war bei den Deva Curl absolut kein Problem, die haben sich Quasi automatisch entknotet) und habe schon mehrere Haare /Strähnen verloren!!! Ich empfehle für lockiges Haar eher die Deva Curl Produkte (sind in der gleichen Preisklasse aber je nachdem wo man es bestellt ist die Lieferung teurer). Ich brauche die Shea Moisture Produkte noch auf aber werde sie nicht mehr kaufen...(Wie aber auch einige andere Rezensionen schon beschrieben haben war eine der Flaschen nicht richtig verschlossen und lief aus..)"

Den einen Stern, den ich ja vergeben muss, bekommt die schnelle Lieferung von UremboDas Produkt bekommt null Punkte.Erster Minuspunkt; der Geruch. Ok, ist subjektiv, aber das stinkt dermassen nach OmaParfüm. Ne, geht garnicht. Wer geruchsempfindlich ist, Finger weg.Zweiter Minuspunkt; viel zu viele Inhaltsstoffe,  das kann Shea Moisture echt besser . Und bei fast 20 Inhaltsstoffen ist an 4. Stelle Parfum..... auweia.Dritter Minuspunkt;Null Hydration. Im Gegenteil.  Meine Haare waren total frizzig danach. Hatte extra Shampoo und Condi zusammen genommen. Keine Chance. Als sie komplett trocken waren,  sah ich aus als hätte ich mal nen dezenten Griff in die Steckdose gewagt.....Vierter Minuspunkt;Ich reagiere leicht allergisch drauf. Ich habe trockene Haare UND Kopfhaut. Das schafft normal ein andrers Shampoo von SM, nur leider hat man von dem nach ein paar Wäschen einen deftigen Build up. Von diesem Set hier bekomme ich brutal juckende Kopfhaut.Also, war wieder ein Griff ins KloIch hab in den letzten Jahren sehr viel Geld ausgegeben für mein 2c/ 3a Lockenhaar.

0,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hair masque I've tried,"Upon initial application of the manuka honey & mafura oil masque I was not impressed. I found there was not a lot of slip with the product. I have type 3b/3c/4a hair. However after 35 minutes under a heating cap, I couldn't believe the moisture level and the definition of my curls. Best masque I've used to date. The masque is worth the hype, so much so that I purchased the remainder of the hair care line."
1,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,I WILL BUY THIS UNTIL THEY STOP MAKING IT!,"I have used many conditioners specifically for more hair moisture.  Of that lot, the best were Organic Root Stimulator's (ORS) Olive Oil Replenishing Conditioner and Nexxus Humectress.  Both have more chemicals than I would like, and I was searching for something more natural as I am now relying on keratin treatments.I decided to try good old Shea Moisture.  I am more familiar with their body washes, scrubs, and lotions than hair products, but as this was a package deal that gave 2 conditioners, I decided to give this a try.Wow what a difference!  No matter what I have done to my hair, it is soft.  And I can use it with my daughter's natural hair, too. She has a great deal of it, very long, with a looser curl pattern.  You don't need much of it to saturate your hair with it, and it is mostly (all?) natural!"
2,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Intense Moisture,"This is a very, very moisturizing deep conditioner.  I purchased it to ensure I put moisture back in my hair after a recent relaxer.  It did not fail me at all.  It has a lot of slip, doesn’t take a lot to coat your strands, and it smells amazing.  I sat under a dryer for 30 minutes to get the most out of the conditioner.  Once rinsed, comb out was a breeze.  I recommend this to anyone with relaxed or natural hair in need of intense moisture.  I will definitely buy again."
3,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Mask,"This has been my go-to hair mask for a long time now. I have fine (diameter of each hair shaft is small) but thick (a very large number of strands) hair, which is also wavy, curly, frizzy. It is very difficult to manage, in my own opinion and that of professional hair stylists too! I use this mask *after every* shampoo, rather than conditioner. I'll concentrate the mask at mid to ends of my hair, and then run the remainder of the mask across my roots, to give them some moisture without weighing down my roots too much. I then gently run a wide tooth comb through my hair and gently massage each section  to work the mask into the strands. After that I pile my hair on top of my head, loosely with a clip and cover my hair in a plastic shower cap and do the rest of my showering (exfoliating, shaving, etc.) Every now and then, if my hair needs extra moisture and softening, I'll put a towel turban over the plastic shower cap, to trap some of the heat from my head which helps the mask penetrate into the hairs, then get out of the shower, letting the mask sit for a half hour or so before rinsing with cool/cold water. This mask has definitely helped a lot with keeping each strand moisturized and preventing breakage, which occurs for me when my fine hairs are overly dried out. It does the most work for minimizing frizz, so then I only need my everyday styling products to do the rest.For my hair type, this mask is NOT too heavy but I have friends with thin (quantity of strands) fine (diameter of strands) hair, who said it made their hair look oily and weighed down.It smells *delicious*, with a hint of honey. The formula itself is very thick and is in a soft, solid form in the tub, which makes it feel very luxurious and nourishing. This is one of the only products I buy in bulk with automatic orders!"

6,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing price for quality,I have very coily 4a hair which needs a lot of moisture since its has high porosity so this definitely helps.

It detangles your hair while putting it on. I have curly medium to course wait length hair if that helps you understand. I would not use any other MASK on my hair, and to be fair I even use it as a conditioner most days as it's so moisturizing.You feel the quality of product when it is on your hair and not just a mask of product! It is almost as if you see your hair soak it in ( Don't know this statement until you try it! )I even suggest using this as a leave-in conditioner at times for those with very dry hair as it works amazing for my curls and looks great!Overall 15 out of 10!!

First tried it with a sample size they sell at Walmart (probably could get it from Amazon too), and I loved it cause it's so hydrating and nurturing. My hair was super soft in the end, definitely a silky result! My hair is thin and curly, and it's oily at the scalp but I tend to have dry ends because I always hot-style my hair. But this product has really worked for me making my hair stay hydrated and shiny! If you have oily hair, don't leave on for too long. I normally leave for 5 minutes, no more than that."

It leaves my hair feeling super silky, soft and moisturized.

175,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for my transitioning hair,So it really didnt do much for me. I'm in the transitioning phase. I used it while deep conditioning my hair and i did nit get tat hydrating result from it. Maybe its more for full blown natural persons but it wasnt for me : (
176,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome deep conditioner,The only deep conditioner I consistently keep in my arsenal. Im African American with bra strap length natural thick kinky curls and my hair is color treated. Super moisturizing and smells amazing. So happy I found a two pack deal even tho they've gone up on the price since I first purchased 😒 keep the price consistent please.
177,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",3.0 out of 5 stars,I can’t find silicones in the ingredients but it seems like there is,"Ok. First things first. I’m a dude. I have low porosity hair that is like 4a, coily!  So, i have a blend of textures that range from curls ( Beaty beads) to coils that look like springs. The leave in conditioner from This line, if i apply it and use a little heat from the blow dryer , it is amazing! I figured this would be too.The first time i used it, i was like “ wow”. My curl pattern was extended and though my coils weren’t what they usually are my hair with gel would sort of clump and then disperse. I was kinda into it because it looked like a different style. Well that was day 1. Day 2-5, it was clear that whatever is in this stuff doesn’t come out without a fight. I work out daily so i would Come from the gym rinse my hair and apply more leave in and gel and it was like my hair couldn’t absorb any other product , AND, this left my hair dry.I tried it the next week and the results weren’t even close. Even with the shampoo from this line it can’t get this stuff out my hair. I figured if it did , maybe i needed to reset/wash my hair midweek? Nope. I cannot find silicones in this but if you read the properties of silicones and how they interact with hair , SOMETHING in this does that to my hair in that it repels any other moisture or product fromAbsorbing into it for weeks at a time. Also, the so called moisturizing effect is short lived. It feels like there is clay or putty in my hair that i cannot get rid of. I literally went out and bought some neutralizing shampoo as i hope it gets this out.I’m still in the market for a good deep conditioner cause this, ain’t it."
178,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally,"I'm not a huge Shea moisture person I've tried some of their popular products and didn't work for my hair. As well as trying other products from other brands after all these years the line that I was using was the reason for my dry desert-like hair so, I needed to revamp everything. I was very surprised that there's a Shea Moisture product that actually worked for me. This has made my hair so soft and silky for days and it did an excellent job at detangling my hair. The smell; however, is not very good, but given the fact that it made my hair feel very moisturized for days makes up for it. This masque definitely does what it says its supposed to do. This is now a staple in routine every week. The consistency is very thick and it does leave residue, but I did put too much and didn't rub it in very well so maybe next time I'll will put less. But overall despite the terrible smell very impressed with this masque."
179,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ehhh...Could Be Better,"Alright y’all, this one did not do it for me. I am currently in my curly hair transition from straighting my hair for over 20 years. I saw this and I thought it would be great!However, although it did most moisturize my hair, I felt that my hair was greasier than going into the shower. It just felt very oily and I’m not sure if it’s suppose to do that or not. I could feel the oils go all over my face and shoulders when I would sleep or throughout the day and it made me want to take a shower again. I’ve tried having it on over night, 20 minutes, 10 minutes, and even 5 minutes with the conditioner on and I still got the same results. Greasy.Also, it had this smell to it that I just did not like. Even after thoroughly washing it out that smell would stay with me for the next two day. It eventually made me nauseous. Overall this just wasn’t for me. Maybe it’s great on someone else. But I wouldn’t use this again."
180,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",4.0 out of 5 stars,Really great!,"Haven't used as a masque yet, but rather as a leave in conditioner for my ends.

190,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,YES YES YES!!!,"The whole Manukau honey set (the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner) did WONDERS for my hair! I saw this method on TikTok where you condition your hair first, shampoo, and then deep condition (I’ll abbreviate it as the C/S/DC method 😜) and BABY let me tell you… my hair has never felt softer and more moisturized! I was a little skeptical at first but now I HIGHLY recommend it if you have dry, low porosity, brittle hair that breaks easily! I used to have TERRIBLE breakage! I mean like losing 3-5 HANDFULS of hair no matter WHAT I did! I’ve tried several different shampoos, conditioners, and deep conditioners… many different oils, I’ve tried finger detangling… I get regular trims from a licensed hairstylist but NOTHING would help with the breakage but baby… doing the C/S/DC method with these products has reduced my breakage GREATLY! In the pic is the amount of hair I’ve lost from START to FINISH!!! Just a palm full!!! My hair has never felt softer and so moisturized and hydrated!!!! I cannot believe that method with these products reduced my hair breakage that much!!!!!!! I’m sure you can do the C/S/DC method with any products from any company but if you’re someone like me that has super dry, brittle hair with low porosity and breaks off easily I’d recommend these from Shea Moisture!! And the manukau honey set smells AMAZING too and the scent lasts which is a plus!!! I’m super excited now I feel like my hair is really going to start growing and getting stronger now I’ll be sure to update if anything changes !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
191,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,We love it for high porosity 3b/3c hair!,"My daughter's hair is very very dry naturally.  She is only one and a half years old. I use this as a mask and also as conditioner. When we wash her hair this is what is used for conditioner because nothing else will work. It is very very thick and although a little goes a long way, I put a lot to get the slip I need to comb out her tangles.  She has very sensitive skin and this hasn't broken her skin out thankfully. It is very highly perfumed and even though I'm not one for strong scents- I'm okay with this one.I mainly wash her hair just once a week.  But because she a toddler, she will get food in her hair while feeding herself.  I will use this when I rinse her hair after dinner if it's necessary.  Its extremely moisturizing and leaves her hair with a softness I cannot otherwise achieve."
192,"Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque, with African Rock Fig & Baobab Oil, 12 Ounce - 2 pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,BUY IT!!!,"I've been using this as my regular conditioner for 3 years (won't advise but has worked for me)!!! I have wavy, fine, thick, and notably textured hair, and have always struggled with dryness and frizz. This makes my hair the softest of any product I've used before, and it's sweet smell is not only great but lasts nicely too. A little bit goes a long way (as in 1 tub per ~14 months when using it as my conditioner), not to mention it's frighteningly cheap for how well it works ...!!! I've also used it as a mask on my friend with dry scalp/coarse hair, and it relieved her itching for the following week-- she's buying it now, which reminded me to write this review :) great stuff, just seeing it in the shower gives me a feeling of relief lol"

Decent smell.,"I love this hair mask. I was looking for something for my hair, it’s been bleached multiple times and toned for the last couple years.

I use this once a week at least. Recommend!"
0,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff!!,"I have type 2A hair that was down to my lower back & I’ve kept it that way for my whole life. I don’t cut it, style it, blow dry it & use as natural/organic of products that I can. HASK & Live Clean were my go-to brands for the last few years.Then on New Years in 2019 I decided to have a little fun & got 8 inches trimmed off, bleached the lower half & dyed it blue. Fast forward to the end of 2020, with the color almost faded out I decided to finish off my bottle of dye & colored it again. Fast forward to a couple months ago? I started getting split ends which NEVER happened before, then the hairs starting snapping off. I was told that between the new job I took last year that requires me to work outdoors in all manner of weather 6 days a week & the stress of the coloring, it decided to revolt. Needless to say I was kinda panicky.After doing some reading on how to possibly save my hair I decided on the following routine:Olly Gummies 3 chews a day instead of 2.Viori Brand Rice Water Shampoo & Condtioner Bars.Shea Moisture Manuka Honey + Mafura Oil Leave-in Hair Milk.Plus keeping it braided more often than I usually do, especially at night.I tried the Jamaican Black Castor Oil repair masque & didn’t see any changes with it so this Hair Milk was my next attempt. I wish I’d gotten it sooner! The smell isn’t overpowering which is great for me, & it’s easy to apply. It’s pretty thick, like the consistency of conditioner & a little goes a long way. I put it on my whole head directly after a shower & comb through it. I don’t have a greasy feeling once it’s dry. I have half a bottle left but I’ll be buying more once I run out!I’ve been doing this for 2 months & finally thought to take photos just 17 days apart & I can definitely see a difference!! Even my friends can tell & my Aunt who is a retired Stylist. If you are struggling with breakage & split ends I would definitely recommend this overall routine.****UPDATE: Added third picture on 8/17. Still improving!"
1,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,For hair that needs alot of moisture and oil.,"This product left too much oil on the surface of my hair. I do not need alot of moisture, or oil for my hair type.This is needed by a person who has a dry hair type that requires alot of moisture, and oil to seal the hair cuticle. Or hair that absorbs alot of product this is perfect for your hair type. I hope this helps someone. All the best to you in your beauty journey."
2,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not having to struggle to use it daily,I am so disappointed in how hard you have to squeeze the bottle to get the hair product out.I literally had to take the top off to get it to come out. I wont be buying it again.
3,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good leave it,Doesn't penatrate hairThickLeave residue
4,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,TRY IT,REMEMBER NOT EVERYONE WILL HAVE THE SAME RESULTS SO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF AND SEE IF ITS A PRODUCT FOR YOU.... THAT BEING SAID I HAVE THICK LONG CURLY HAIR AND ITS DRY AND I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I PUT ENOUGH OF ANY PRODUCT...... BUT THIS HELPED A LITTLE
5,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,Did not work for my hair. It's so thick it is impossible to get from the bottle. The smell is decent but is so thick for hair. Made my hair hard and greasy.
6,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,A little to thick,Smells great.. familiar with the line but it is very thick it’ll do fine since my hair is thick but it mixes well with water.. so I mixed the two to make a conditioner for my protective style.
7,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"too thick to be called a milk, good product","The media could not be loaded.
                




   This line by shea is truly hydrating for my fine, frizzy, wavy to curly hair. I have half a bottle left, however the ""milk"" is absolutely not a milk. Although, it is moisturizing. From a full bottle to the end, the consistency is as thick as trying to squeeze out peanut butter from a tube with a cap on. The cap only makes it more difficult. It requires vigorous shaking and hitting of the bottle to be able to squeeze some out."
8,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!!!!,Makes my gray hair softer and more manageable. Love this product line and I have several of the shampoos and conditioners. Great for severely dry hair or course hair. I provided photos so you can see it doesn’t weigh down your hair when wanting volume.
9,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Stuff,"This is my favorite leave-in conditioner. I combine with a curl lotion and the two work great together and/or stand-alone. The smell is not overwhelming but pleasant. The solution is VERY thick yet for me, once my hair has dried there is no sticky, tacky residue. It is completely absorbed and leaves my proud, natural African American combination crown soft, touchable with actual sheen. I really wish Shea Moisture would offer this with a pump. It would create  better access when dispensing, plus offer a larger size. Excellent product!!!"
10,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you're looking for hydration, this is it!","This was recommended to me to soothe my dry silver gray hair. It has been fantastic! the moisturizing milk has pleasant scent, soften my hair and gave me the soft style I was looking for. I love it."
11,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Needs a pump — too thick,I would like this product a lot more if it weren’t so difficult to use. It’s not a milk. It is super thick and really hard to get out of the bottle. It’s way thicker than their conditioner so I don’t understand why that product gets a pump and this doesn’t. The packaging really detracts from an otherwise good product to the point that I probably won’t but it again.
12,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"I love the whole set. Leaves my hair soft and moisturized.  No complaints at all.  My hair was super dry and damaged from age, perms, weaves, braids, etc.  Now my 4c hair is easy to comb after washing it."
13,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Like the product but awful container,"Like the product so far. BUT, the product is very thick, the small plastic container is stiff and it's nearly impossible to squeeze it and get any product out. Should come with a pump or a softer squeeze bottle or larger opening. Takes way too much time and effort to get a drop of the product out of a full bottle, upside down, shaking and squeezing it. The opening is too small to get a finger through, there will be no way to get it out once there is less product left in the bottle without breaking the ×@^!% thing open and buying a new dispenser! Ridiculous design flaw! Deducting stars because it shouldn't be a struggle to dispense the product!"
14,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gets my head together,Need a tub version of this too

16,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best conditioner for dry or damaged hair that I've ever used!,As I've gotten older it's gotten harder for me to find a conditioner that keeps my hair soft for more than a day.  I've gotten 3-4 days of the initial application softness with this product!
17,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like this product but not sure if I'll repurchase,"I like it but there is something in this product that makes my hair feel a bit sticky until fully dried. I'm debating whether I'll repurchase given that there are other leave ins that don't leave such a heavy residue. Note, once the hair dries, it is no longer sticky, it feels moisturized."
18,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff but hard to get at.,The conditioner itself is fantastic and deserves 5 stars.

24,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,"It’s thick but not hair butter like thick. It’s very moisturizing and when I applied it, my hair looked really moisturized and luscious. The scent is a more of a mature scent with a hint of sweetness. Personally, I prefer sweeter scents (like candy rot sweet) but the scent isn’t bad. If I were to buy it again it would be because it is very moisturizing, not for the scent"

I'm struggling to squeeze out of the bottle and I've just started using. Can't imagine how I'll be able to get this out of the bottle once more has been used. Was skeptical when I read someone had to literally slice bottle open to access this cream,  but now am a believer.  This would be so much easier to access if sold in a jar! Disappointed as I love this product! UPDATE: AddeReplaced cap with a pump from another empty Shea Moisture bottle. Works much better."
49,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Recommend This.,"I love this product.

51,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a deep condition,"I just purchased this product and I noticed a lot of complaints about it leaving a greasy residue.....I find it perfect for my relaxed hair as it can be super dry and it seems no matter how much moisturizer I add, it's bone dry by day 2. This is exactly what I need as my hair drinks up any moisture very quickly and I have a higher demand for moisture and oil than some. I do see how it can leave a bit of a oily residue. Especially if you use it just before going out.....it def needs time to soak into the hair, so the best time to apply would be a night. If you are relaxed this is a great moisture filled product."
52,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is just lotion,"This is so thick and sticky…you won’t get it out if the bottle, and you may as well just buy lotion and put it in your hair.

61,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe It's Just Me...,"First of all, let me say that I'm a HUGE fan of Sheamoisture products! In fact, the main reason that I purchased this Hair Milk was due to my great experience with their Intensive Hydration Conditioner, which comes in a similar bottle and does wonders for my dry, 4-C hair.Given my high expectations, I was extremely disappointed with this product. I know my standards are high and everyone's hair is different but I trusted that I would come out okay because it was a Sheamoisture product. I could not have been more wrong (assuming it's really a SM product and not a knockoff).The product was, first of all, super thick. My hair is low-porosity, so I often thin such products out with a bit of warm water to help my hair absorb it. I didn't do that will this one, thinking I'd just apply it to get the full effect. If anything, it actually left my hair feeling even DRYER than usual!I will be attempting to return this product."
62,Sheamoisture Hydration Hair Milk for Dry Hair Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil to Hydrate and Style Hair 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for fine hair,"This smells nice. My hair is waist length, curly/wavy and fine. I used this as directed and it was just too heavy and made my hair feel greasy and weighed down.

Works best, if utilized every 2 weeks, from my experience.It has been added to MY HAIR  RESUME! 😆"
