   I am disappointed in this product. I wanted to love Uncle Funkys but just couldn’t due to their lies about the ingredients.If you have curly hair like me, you are always trying to find silicone and sulfate free conditioner. However, even through the bottle says free of silicone and sulfates, they are LYING because they have AMIDIMITHICONE AND BEHNTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE! How is a supposed “hydrating conditioner” going to moisturize and keep your hair hydrated with ingredients that keep out moisture.So disappointed and disgusted with this brand and product. Never again will I buy."
2,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,love this,I love the moisture I get makes my hair feel very soft. I also love because of the natural ingredients. I have 4b 4c hair
3,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazzzzzing product! Great job to the developer of this product. Thank you!,I love this product! I have really damaged hair from the water we use here deployed in Afghanistan. This conditioner smells soo great! I love this product line. Especially the curl stimulator with the butter cream.
4,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed!,"Really love this product so far. It’s been about a month since ordering. It’s a very thick conditioner, which I need because I have very wild, tangly long hair. It doesn’t weigh it down from what I’ve noticed either. I used to use wayyy more expensive conditioner but I don’t think I would ever switch back. Highly recommend for people with long wavy/curly thick hair."
5,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves hair soft and detangled,"Using the richer rich moisturizer us very good, it conditions well ,softness, don't have to use alot, let sit 15-30 minutes rinse leaves hair very soft and smells great."

7,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Slip for Naturally Kinky/Coily Hair,"It can be used as a deep conditioner and it's very moisturizing. It does help detangle coily, kinky textures."
8,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Uncle Funky's Conditioner,Did not truly deliver as advertised. Not a great bargain; pricey for the small size (only 8 oz.)

18,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly hair!!,"I have a wavy, curly mix, and like to use sulfate and silicone free products, but have issues with my scalp becoming irritated, dry, and flaky, as well as having my hair break and losing hair. These products work GREAT! So far, my scalp feels wonderful, and my hair isn't dry. My curl is revived, and I feel good about my hair again!!"
19,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This BUT....,This is an amazing product but won't purchase again due to the shipping costs.
20,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Eh not the conditioner for thick hair,"Given that I have a product from this brand I figured to give the conditioner a try and it was horrible it’s soft and smells great but did nothing for my hair, I have thick hair so I always need a reliable conditioner, this was not it"
21,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Great quality product. My wife uses it all the time
22,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!,Provides the most slip ever. I love it!
23,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Very good conditioner
24,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy it!,This conditioner is packed with silicones!!! Specifically amodimethicone and dimethicone. Everything with a blue-green label from Uncle's Funky's Daughter is a no-no. Anyone with low porosity hair should stay away from their products all together. You're welcome.
25,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great curly hair conditioner,Love this product
26,"Richee Rich Moisturizing Conditioner, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a good product!,Conditioner made my hair feel soft and moisturized.
0,Heal & Renew,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wow,"I recently dyed my hair blonde- and of course it's a mission to keep it moisturized. I have been going through different hair mask's to see what works for the week, since with curly hair AND bleached you should wash less frequently. I had to replace my Devacurl melt into moisture because it was causing issues with my scalp, not moisturizing for the whole week and my curls were weighed down. THIS is amazing. My scalp feels great, my curls FELT moisturized, and it really did heal up some damage from my last touch up. It smells like mint, I left it on for 30mins as advised, and my hair just felt stronger and LOOKED moisturized even while wet (no frizz). My ONLY issue, is that it's very small for what you pay- but other than that, worth a try. This company in general, when you use their products you can just feel your hair respond to it immediately. Highly recommended for damaged curls!"
1,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Hair Moisturizer!,Hands down THE best conditioner or mask I've ever used. I have 2B/3C curly low porosity hair that tends to be dry and frizzy. I live in Wyoming with a very dry climate and have been using this wonderful smelling mask as a conditioner (apply after shampooing and leave on for about 5-7 minuted before rinsing) once or twice a week. Followed up with UFD curly magic and I get beautiful soft shiny curls. LOVE the fruity/minty non-perfumy smell. Thanks UFD!!!
2,Heal & Renew,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,"Ok product, it’s very thick but not worth the money  I have shoulder length hair and could only get about three uses out of it and that’s definitely not worth it for the price."
3,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,But for the price....,"I am a fan of Uncle Funky’s Daughter products and my overall favorite is the Heal & Renew mask. From over coloring, over heating and stress my hair was badly damaged. I began steaming my hair with one product, saw a difference but wasn’t truly satisfied. I tried the UFD’s Renew & Heal and my hair feel in love. My hair was soft, manageable and I had little breakage. I need to buy more but $22.00? Hey, sometimes you have to pay more for quality."
4,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,I live in the tropics with curly/ frizzy hair.,Love love love. Now all I have is curly hair with no frizz!
5,Heal & Renew,1.0 out of 5 stars,Spilled all over the box!,"I just received this item,  the jar lid was open and there was only about half of the product in the container. the rest was spilled all over the box! this is a very pricy product to receive it open and spilled. whay can I do?"
6,Heal & Renew,2.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,"Reviews said it was good for bleached frizzy hair, but it did nothing for me. Waste of money."
7,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Literally magical,"Wow! I was not expecting the smell and moisture this product brought to my hair. I wish the container was larger for the price because I do have thick hair (3c/4a curl type) and it’s a lot. But a little can go a long way. Will be purchasing again. Feels great on my scalp too, like a refreshing feeling."
8,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,All their products are a must for curls!,"The smell of this stuff!! Amazing! Feels minty and fresh! Leaves your hair soft, silky and shiny!"
9,Heal & Renew,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a fave as a conditioner, but it smells nice!","This hair mask was okay. It smells nice, but it’s a bit watery. Admittedly, I’ve only used it once. In my opinion, Shea moisture products found at my local CVS did a better job conditioning my curls and coils."
10,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product was recommended off of a you tube channel and it was a good recommendation.,This product is great. Little costly for the size but all in all a very good hair mask.
11,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,Love
12,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tiny Jar,"It's really good; however, it doesn't last long if you have thick hair (1-2 uses)."
13,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product makes my hair very soft and shiny,I love the smell of this product I used it for deep conditioning
14,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,My package arriving in good condition,My package came in excellent condition Thankyou
15,Heal & Renew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing Hair Masque,"This masque is awesome! It's a challenge for me to find deep conditioners that don't contain a lot of junk ingredients --- Heal & Renew is perfection. It has a peppermint/lightly perfumed scent. Most of the ingredients are film forming humectants including a little bit of silk protein, which is excellent for highly porous/color treated hair. You don't need to be heavy-handed with this. A little bit goes a long way, which usually isn't the case with a masque. This is a keeper."
16,Heal & Renew,3.0 out of 5 stars,A balanced conditioner,I like this conditioner but it pentrates and my hair does feel as moisturized as so other deep conditioners. It is more difficult to detangle hair.  I allow it to sit on hair before detangling but my hair soaks it up so much do that there is no slip.
17,Heal & Renew,2.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced,Insanely small for the price I like their products but not worth it.
18,Heal & Renew,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible. No penetration, just sits on your hair.","The only great thing about this product is the smell if you like peppermint, which I do not. Contains glycerin as one of the first 3 ingredients, which is never good for low porosity hair. Buy Kinky Curly's Stellar Strands for deep conditioning if you want the conditioner to really, truly penetrate your hair. With Stellar Strands, your curls are defined before doing the LOC/LCO method, meaning the deep conditioner is not just sitting on top of your head like Heal & Renew."
19,Heal & Renew,3.0 out of 5 stars,Super creamy but more stengthening type of mask,"I have heard and read rave reviews for this heal renew treatment . I feel it's more of a strengthening mask then moisture mask. It smells really nice , pleasent and not over powering like most . A little bit goes a long way , it's very very creamy which I love . I apply on soakinh wet hair it kind of sits on my hair so I have to use a heating cap . and then I also use a more moisturizing deep conditioner because this is not a moisture treatment and there isn't nuch slip tp detangle my 4c hair ."
0,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow,"I have bleached curls. It takes a lot to keep them moisturized. I usually use AG's leave in which is AMAZING, but wanted to try something a little more on the natural side for the health of my hair. I was skeptical of this because it's spray and not cream form- and I REALLY need the moisture to last all week. This stuff, is amazing. My hair felt so soft. And I have been using it to refresh and my curls drink it up. It smells so lovely too. Highly recommend you try it- and even though this line carries a refresher (that I can't wait to try) you can use this product for both leave in and refresh. Not heavy AT ALL. I'm loving this line!"
1,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,HORRIBLE - DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"HORRIBLE – DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!After trying this product for about 1 week, my hair was so dry and brittle it was unbelievable.I contacted the Seller which is direct (Uncle Funky Monkey or something) and they pretty much said “Sorry cant help you “My recommendation, don’t buy from a Company that does not back their product, obviously they are NOT looking out for the best interest of their Customer!"
2,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice smell and softness,"I like the smell,  texture of the mist, makes the curls  pop with the mist sprayed onto hair.  I like all the products from this line and will continue to use and buy more products from Uncle Funky's Daughter ."
3,Midnite Train,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best smelling product.,"So far this product has been good with my hair. The only thing that is preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the smell. It's probably one of the worst smelling that I've ever used and I wasnt sure that I can keep with the smell. I will say though that the smell goes away after I add other products from this line. That being said, I will keep with the product because the smell goes away after other things have been added"
4,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does nothing- consistency it terrible,A YouTube blogger said this was great....NOPE watery and overpriced- I had to return it!
5,Midnite Train,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Just didnt measure up,,,,,",I was expecting a lot more than I got. Just an average product that didnt deliver the results  I wanted. Too expensive to ship back so I'm stuck with it.
6,Midnite Train,4.0 out of 5 stars,My go to products!,I get great results every time. Pairs great with the Curly Magic Curl Stimulator.

15,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not moisturize my hair,Did not moisturize my hair. Made it feel very rough

17,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best leave in conditioner for my type 4 hair,Best leave in conditioner for my type 4 hair. I use it everyday to refresh & hydrate my curly hair. And the spray smells like blueberries. I highly recommend!

24,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Love me some Uncle Funky's!
25,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,Need improvement,Makes my hair dry
26,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,My hair hates it!
27,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,I truly love this product it helped me combat dandruff.
28,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,LOVE it!
29,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair hated it instantly,"Usually when my hair does not like a product my hair will look nice for the first few days after styling but will start to get dry and be dryer than normal by the next wash day; with this product, I had an instantaneous dryness and brittleness that floored me. My hair was still wet and freshly deep conditioned when I applied this product to my hair and my hair became very brittle and tangled right away! I'm not sure if it was the protein in the product or what caused the bad reaction, but it went into the garbage right away."
30,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curl Refresher not Leave-In,"Great product, but not for suggested use. I find the best way to use this product is as a refresher. As a leave-in it does not provide enough slip to detangle. But as a refresher, my curls look and feel so moisturized!"
31,Midnite Train,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like it!!,I really like it.  Use it after every workout.  It works great!
32,Midnite Train,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Products but overpriced on Amazon,It's better to order from UFD website.
33,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for Type 4 Hair,I have 4 grade hair. This makes it brittle. It has a lot of perfume and alcohol in it. It's cool if you like your hair to smell good.
34,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,I love Midnight Train Conditioner. It keeps my 4c hair moist without build up
35,Midnite Train,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Very good
36,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,Very sticky didn’t like at all
37,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a YES for me!,My curly salon uses their products and this right here along with their curl gel was the only product that defined my 4B hair!
38,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great smell,Smells amazing
39,Midnite Train,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for soft manageable curls,Very disappointed.  It created some sort of film on my hair.  It caused my soft curls to be dry and brittle after 1 use. Not again will I order this.  It's taken me weeks to get NY hair manageable again!
40,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product terrible delivery.,The product works in my hair exactly as stated on the bottle.
41,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased ☺️,This product is awesome it has a great smell it's not sticky and loosen up curles well
42,Midnite Train,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everyone’s hair is different. Try it yourself.,I originally tried the sample kit and fell in love with the products. I was so tired of all the corporate drama with other hair companies. Midnight Train works amazing on my hair. I pair it with Curly Magic or Extra Butter. Don’t buy a full size to “try” and complain about it in the comments. I am so glad they had the samples sizes in a cute kit. I refill the sample sizes and take them with me when I travel. Give them a try. I don’t mix brands on my hair either. That may be some of the issues others are having.
