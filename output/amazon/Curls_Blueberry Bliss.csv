0,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,You can't use this like a regular shampoo. Read me..,"25 year old dude with long curled hair. I need out about all my hobbies and when I decided to grow my hair out I needed out about shampoo. People love to tout having sulfate free shampoos, and I've learned that they can still be so freaking harsh on your hair. This shampoo isn't harsh: THEREFORE it will feel weak compared to other shampoos you've used. It is. It's not going to strip your hair. It will clean it while coating and moisturizing it. You also need to know YOUR hair and know how often you need a rinse vs wash vs clarifying wash etc. You need to know your oil production and protein needs and hydration levels. This shampoo will work miracles but you still have to use brain to get the best results. Combined with the blue berry leave in conditioner, I'm basically rocking the most gorgeous head of hair in my hometown, male or female. Take your hair more seriously. Research this stuff. And buy this shampoo, and their leave in. Drop mic"
1,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my favorite smelling shampoo in the world,"This is my favorite smelling shampoo in the world. I use all the Curls Blueberry products because the smell is just so great, and my boyfriend loves it too.This is a sulfate free cleanser, but it lathers more than i expected it to. After rinsing my hair out, i swear I've never felt my hair so silky between my fingers. And on top of that, after running a brush through, there were no tangles at all, and my hair was mega smooth.I'm a latina girl with naturally wavy hair that curls on the end. After using these products, i have noticeably more defined curls, and way more bounce to my hair overall.I waited more than a month to review this, just to make sure i liked it, and i'm impressed. Will definitely purchase again!"
2,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Gummy, sticky, gross — and NOT a shampoo!","There's a reason this is labeled as a ""wash,"" not a shampoo; it's really a co-wash (conditioner used instead of shampoo), not a shampoo. And it's gross — it would NOT rinse out of my hair and left such a nasty, gummy residue that I had to use a clarifying shampoo to get it out.  If you're looking for a good co-wash for curly hair, As I Am Coconut Co-Wash works so much better and smells nicer, too. This stuff (and the matching conditioner) was a total waste of money. :-("
3,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,A really great non-sulfate cleanser,"This lovely cleanser is the first non-sulfate shampoo that I've liked, and I've tried several before including the Deva Lo Poo.  If you are looking for a non-sulfate shampoo that does the job, cleanses your hair and scalp well, try it!  Nice, and creamy, with a pleasant fragrance.  I'm impressed and will look at other products made by this company (Curls)."
4,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Completely STRIPS Hair of Nutrients and Leaves Buildup,"So I really liked this product when I first started using it last year, it would at times leave a little buildup on my scalp but part of me thought that was just because of me using too hot of water. Fast forward to now, I have realized it has completely stripped my hair of natural moisture and left my scalp waxy with so much buildup. I’ve tried leaving out other products in my routine to see if they were the culprits and it’s led me back to this one.The colder the water i used to wash my hair, the more waxiness and build up that was left, BUT if i used warmer water it still left a ton of buildup and a slight itchiness afterwards on my scalp. This last time I’ve used it, it also left me with a disgusting smell in my hair. I’m very disappointed because I’ve heard such great reviews about this product and now it has damaged my hair in the long run."
5,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,2 in 1,"This isn’t a typical shampoo. It’s more like a high-quality 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner. Or a co-wash with added gentle foaming detergents. The instructions on the bottle recommend shampooing twice and leaving it on the hair for several minutes to condition. It is a very heavy, moisturizing product that doesn’t feel like any other shampoo I’ve ever used before. For my texture (2a-2b wavy), it provides all the moisture I need without conditioner. I just need a light detangler afterward, as it doesn’t really have enough slip for combing through.It’s the first shampoo in a long time that I’ve repurchased several times in a row. Very happy with how it works for my hair, and the moisture lets me cut multiple conditioning and leave-in products from my routine."
6,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Great and Moisturizes My Curls Like No Other,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this line! This hair wash smells great and moisturizes my curls like no other. I really love how soft it make my hair and how easy it is to detangle my hair while using this product. I can detangle it while shampooing or when using the repairing conditioner-- it doesn't mater, it's just that good, I have 4B/C hair and issa go to product for me. Did I mention it smells lovely?"
7,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as great as people praised to be,"So the scent is supposedly great but it isn’t. It is your typical cough medicine scent that is very strong. I’ve noticed since I started using it, my head becomes “dirty” or oily a lot quicker. It sure hydrates my hair but not worth it."
8,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Recieved expired product,I've been using this product for close to 5 years. The product I received was expired this time and therefore does not function as it is suppose to. The product I received was completely separated inside the bottle and had a different consistency than this product should have.
9,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great shampoo, has chamomile!",This is one of my all time favorite shampoos. It makes my color treated hair silky soft and washes oil treatments from my hair with ease without overstripping moisture from my hair or washing out my dye
10,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome sulfate free shampoo,"Best shampoo I have found for my daughter’s type 3a/b curls. It’s light weight, has impressive slip for a shampoo and doesn’t dry out her hair. Follow up blueberry leave in conditioner and her hair is very soft. It’s sulfate free which is a bonus. Smells great too"

55,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like my freshman year of college,"SERIOUSLY this smells like cheap blueberry vodka.  Dont know how anyone could acutally enjoy the putrid alcohol smell of this product. Unless you enjoy reliving your poor decisions as a college freshmen, don't buy this."
56,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Left my hair a hot mess,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I ordered the Pineapple line but couldn't wait another few days to wash my hair so I went to Target and picked up the Blueberry Bliss I've heard so much about. I washed my hair twice with the curl wash, dried it off, then looked at my hair... it was full of chunks of product! I tried to wash it out with another shampoo, which didn't work. I brushed my hair to get the clumps out, which I think made it worse because now the clumps are spread out on my strands; they feel like clumps of a sticky grease/oil when you rub them between your fingers. After brushing I washed my hair again with a deep cleaning shampoo, but I still feel the residue on my hair even after using really hot water on it. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my hair from here, I hope it isn't a long-term effect. I'm going to take the products back to Target tomorrow and reach out about returning the products I just ordered when the company opens on Tuesday. I'm so upset, pissed, and disappointed about this experience;I had high hopes for this brand. Guess I'm going back to Mielle products."
57,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE in a bottle,"I absolutely love this blueberry bliss jelly. It leaves you with a soft hold, curls for days, and it smells amazing. There is absolutely no flaking or stiffness. This is my go to for all things curly and leaves my wash and go looking bomb."
58,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works on wavy/curly hair,"I have 2c/3a wavy/curly hair and this shampoo is my single holy grail curl product. My hair has a tendency to frizz up no matter what smoothing products I use, but since switching to this, now it dries in beautiful ringlets. It is a visible difference if I use a different shampoo even once. I’m on my third bottle and I stock up whenever I can. Leave it in your hair as long as you can in the shower to let it work its magic — I like to brush my teeth and shave my legs while this chills. I’m Korean/Italian and appreciate supporting a black-owned business that works on all types of curly hair! ♥️"
59,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sweet and worth it,Never sure what to expect with shampoos ~ no matter what reviews say or the product boasts of. But ~ This was a great buy. Quite happy with the product overall so would recommend. The smell is very sweet in bottle but my hair smells really nice after being washed.
60,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing products,"I love the blue berry bliss collection!

63,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I ordered this item from Beauty Monster and after reading the most recent review I decided to order direct from the supplier in the US (I'm based in the UK). Sadly this product is not the same, see picture. I tried to contact the company direct as it might have been a bad batch/out of date but they did not want to engage with me. This is quite concerning especially when you want to inform them that the product they have isnt the same as the original. I still had some left from a previous order which was also the exact same consistency as the US version. I have bought from Amazon before and it's been fine but I won't buy again from this supplier"

65,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I've been using this along with another product designed for Afro hair and I like the way it seems to be helping. Not a foamy shampoo but with conditioners it makes the hair soft

69,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Appena arrivato e subito usato: ottimo! Come promesso neanche una leggera schiuma senza solfati, siliconi e parabeni!! I capelli sono morbidi al tatto, pensavo di acquistare anche il balsamo ma non credo ci sia bisogno, fa già effetto solo lo shampoo, ho i capelli moooooolto fini e l’unico modo che ho trovato per avere dei ricci è stato quello di fare la permanente, risultato: mooooolto volume ma anche crespo, cosa che io non MAI avuto!! Il riccio appare più definito e meno crespo. Inoltre ho anche il problema di dermatite seborroica, per questo peró dovró  testarlo almeno un altro paio di volte prima di poter dare una recensione a riguardo. Certó è, che al momento, non mi ha dato alcun fastidio, vedremo col tempo! Per ora posso dire che sono sicura di riaquistarlo! Unica pecca il prezzo: ho avuto la fortuna di acquistarlo a €21 e il giorno dopo era già aumentato a €28!!!!"

0,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for fine curly hair!! Game changer!,"Y’all... I have fine 2b 2c 3a 3b hair. (All kinds id different curls) and it’s HARD to find products that don’t weigh my hair down and will moisturize with the right protein balance. This leave in is AMAZING! It’s moisturizing, light weight, and gives tons of definition without being heavy. It’s a definite game changer for me. I have tried kinky curly knot today and it was just too much for my fine hair. I’m telling you, if your curls flatten or look dry, try this leave in before you apply your gel. You won’t regret it!"
1,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes! Buy this product!,Absolutely loved this product & it smells amazing! Picture says it all and this was on a humid day in Texas! Those are natural curls with a dime size amount of curls product.
2,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,It's great for 4B/C hair and 3c,I was hesitant to try this product because I usually don't spend eleven dollars on such a small amount of product. However I was able to use this on my ahir as well as my 2 cousins for more than a month. It worked on my 2A through 3C hair and my cousins 4B/C hair. I usually can't find products that both of our hair can agree on and this worked very well.
3,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,I dont think I can ever live without this???,"Okay ladies, gents, and otherwise- if you're looking for a leave-in conditioner save your time and click buy.  I have medium curly/wavy hair and it's down past my back so maintaining it isn't easy.  My poor ends were shouting at me for some moisture and each product I tried didn't seem the give any benefits after a few hours.  Being a curly girl and only shampooing once or twice a week, I needed something I could leave in for a few days and not have to touch up constantly.  I use this when getting out of the shower right before I towel and then once again after I get out of the towel, so on each step my ends can try and absorb some.  Generally, around day 2-3 I will do another little spritz up.  This has helped my hair continue to grow and smells d e l i c i o u s.  The Blueberry is heaven."
4,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,My curls are loving it!,"I’ve been using this for about 3/4 weeks now and my hair has never been more soft and curly! I have naturally black curly hair but after bleaching it blonde, my hair had lost some of its curl and started feeling very dry. Blueberry Bliss has fixed that problem for me completely!  I have never been able to find a product that works SO well on my hair! It smells amazing too! I was not paid or asked to write a review by the company, I seriously just love it so much."
5,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best leave in conditioner!,"CURLY GIRL HERE! 🙋🏻‍♀️ I follow the curly girl method (cgm) and this is one of my favoriteee leave ins! It’s not too heavy or greasy and always leaves my hair so soft. I’m a 2c/3a curl type, low porosity. Definitely use on the daily. No product build up, non greasy. Can use in my squirt bottle for refresh days or on super humid days, praying hands method a dime sized amount into my soaking wet curls. Will be buying again, in bulk! :)"
6,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I excpected,"Okay, so what can I say about this product.  It smells good and has a nice texture.  My daughter is half Dominican, White and Black and she has LOTS of thick, kinky, curly hair.  If I don't somehow keep it moisturized then it looks dull and super dry.  I bought this product because of the reviews, but maybe it's just not the right product for her hair.  I feel like I have to use a lot just to get it moisturized where it doesn't look dry.  Maybe I need to try something else?"
7,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best leave-in ever!,Best leave in conditioner for my girls hair and I've tried damn near everything on the market.  They have super curly mixed hair. This stuff really works to make their curls soft and bouncy and defined.  I also use the blueberry gel of this brand to help hold the curls together in the crazy SoFlo humidity.  Love this stuff!
8,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,This is nice and moisturizing however it builds up in your hair ...,"This is nice and moisturizing however it builds up in your hair so if you don't wash your hair everyday, it builds up and tangles your hair."
9,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best leave in conditioner EVER,"Best leave in conditioner EVER. I have fine 3b/3c hair but I do have a lot of it, so I've had a hard time finding a product light enough that I don't lose all volume in my hair but will still actually do something. This is the answer! I apply it wet, brush my hair out upside down, scrunch excess water and product out, and then finger comb to separate curls. Flip your head up and all done! I can just leave the house after that and it'll be dry in a couple hours (benefit of fine hair). It also smells like blueberry coconut heaven! Works so well, can't praise it enough.The first pic is pretty much dry, and may be second day (don't quite remember). The second pic my ends are starting to dry and fluff up but the majority of my hair is still wet. It has only been about 50 minutes since I got out of the shower (enough time to do get dressed, do makeup, and chill for about 10 mins)."
10,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great For Me and is CGM Approved...,"A couple of months ago, I knew I needed a new leave-in, so I did some research and kept coming back to this one. It has worked really well for me. My hair is very fine and also very thick (yes, your hair can be both), and this does not weigh my hair down or leave it greasy or crunchy. I do not have to use a huge amount of it. I'm actually still on the same bottle, and my hair falls past my shoulders, so that's pretty good in my book. Also, my hair has a tendency to grow out and split on the ends, I think this (along with necessary trimming when needed, of course) has kept my ends looking far healthier for far longer (I use it on the full length of my hair, except for near the scalp). It is CGM approved, which is nice whether you follow that method or not, because it doesn't cause build-up. I'm definitely pleased with it."

12,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells awful,I have fine wavy hair.  The product worked ok.  Nothing amazing for me.  My complaint is the smell.  It's awful.  I'm very sensitive to scents and odors so I always read reviews on hair products before buying.  I've thrown out full bottles of product if the scent makes me sick.  I read plenty of reviews saying this one smelled amazing so I gave it a try.  Maybe I had a bad batch because this smelled bad.  Thank goodness it doesn't have a lingering scent so it doesn't last very long.  I just have to make sure to pull my hair out of my face for about an hour after applying it.  I would have tossed this away already but my usual product is currently out of stock.
13,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product that’s CG approved,"Love love love. I have 2c/3a curls and it is a little heavy so I tend to use less product when I wear my hair natural. If I do any other styles, I put a lot more product in my hair. I’ve had it for a few months and use it every time I wash my hair (2 times a week max) and I’ve only used maybe 1/10th if the bottle. A little goes a long ways. The scent smells amazing and I love that I can use this on not just my curly hair but as a balm when I straighten my hair. Love that this is CG approved as well"
14,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this for my curls,"Love this for my curls, leaves them soft and moisturized without weighing them down. Split your damp hair into 4 sections and apply the product on each section, use a diffuser to dry your hair or let air dry either way I got great results. And BTW, it smells wonderful!"
15,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,A little heavy for fine hair,"It let my hair incredibly soft.  I have hair about 4 inches past my shoulders, it's fine and wavy.  I used about a nickel size worth of product on my wet clean hair and that amount was too heavy for my hair.  I'll try about a pea size on my next washday and see if that makes a difference.  Smells light and clean.  I will most likely not purchase again, just not right for my hair type.  Will most likely give to my daughter who has thicker coarser curlier hair that mine."
16,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,BOMB. Works perfect on 3C / 4A hair texture!,I'm half Black and half Asian and I've been struggling on how to style my Black hair because my mom can't help me she's Asian and doesn't know so I've been trying so many products for my hair type and finally found the one!! Yes sisters this conditioner really moisturizes your hair and makes detangling easy. I wish I could show a before and after because when I have no products in my hair its dry and tangled and big fro it's hard to style. But This conditioner makes my hair smooth and easy!
17,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for Fragrance Sensitive People,"I have a fragrance sensitivity and searching for hair products I can tolerate is a nightmare. I thought an ""all-natural"" product like this would have a natural scent. But it has a very strong fake blueberry scent that I swear is artificial fragrance. It bothered me long after I put it in my hair. Also, as a leave-in it left my hair greasy and weighed down. I didn't find anything I liked about it, and threw it out."
18,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Seller, Best Product","I love this product. And the seller I purchased from ""Choose Happiness""--lives up to his name. My product arrived damaged (broken cap, leaked product), and because I can't leave my home to return it right now, I thought I was just stuck. Then--without my even asking--the seller decided to send me a replacement item anyway! I will shop at ""Choose Happiness"" FIRST from now on before buying from other sellers. More than trustworthy, they go BEYOND what's expected because, after all, it was Amazon's packing accident, not this seller's. GREAT PEOPLE! (And yes, great product!)"
19,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Protein Leave-In,"I am following the curly girl method. This was recommended by Swavy Curly Courtney (see her youtube channel if you are following the curly girl method, have wavy and fine hair, and are wanting some tips!). I have tried this once - it seems to work very well! A little goes a long way, so this should last a while. The product was packed very well. No product leaked/spilled."
20,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on fine thin hair too!,"Just try it. I’ve tried tons of products for my hair and this is a favorite. Works with curly girl method for me. For reference, my hair with most conditioners just comes out frizzy like an ungroomed poodle. My hair so thin and fine I can out it up with one of those mini 1/4 inch claw clips people use for their bangs. When I use this it ends up with spiral curls, and it looks like I have a LOT of hair. No frizz if I take the time to do it right. Acceptable frizz otherwise."
21,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this everyday now!,"Speechless how much of a difference this makes in my hair!! For myself I can even imagine NOT using this!!!! Must buy for frizzy, loss of curl, and shine hair!!"
22,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,This just might be the best leave in ever,The instant this product touched my hair I was amazed. I have thick curly hair and I have trouble with keeping my hair moist but this creamy leave-in did the trick.
23,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Curly Girl followers,"This product has Curly Girl approved ingredients, is lightweight, and works wonders for dry hair.  It smells amazing, too -which is always a plus.  I only use a dime size amount (or even less) when putting on immediately after showering - more than that prevents my 2A/2B waves from showing.  In the shower, I sometimes use more, leave in for entire shower, then rinse out. Ends up lasting a long time!!! It was recommended by a YouTube vlogger and it does not disappoint.  I will definitely buy again!"
24,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy Grail Leave In,"I've tried quite a few leave ins while on my curly girl method journey, but this one is BY FAR my favorite. I've had my best results since switching to this in combination with my other products. It smells beautiful and is lightweight, which is my preference on leave in to not weigh down my hair too much as I do have to use quite a bit of product. I have 2c/3a curls, high porosity, thick and dense hair and highly recommend if your hair is similar! I apply it on wash days right after I am done in the shower to my wet hair and rake it through!"
25,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy & it does clog ur pores!,"Only thing that I will say is that this product is acnegenic, & comnegenic. So if u struggle with acne, or clogged pores, I wouldn't use this. But it is Very hydrating & smells Awesome! Makes ur hair smooth, & soft. It's just extremely heavy. Wish I would have researched a little more b4 buying. Do ur research on ingredients!"
26,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,makes my curls feel light and soft,"I love  this product.  I was worried it wouldn't work for my hair, because all the advertisements had ethnic hair in them.  But it works fabulously!  It help my curls stay soft and defined, they have more bounce because it's a conditioner not a product loaded with alcohol - so no dry, breaking curls.  Just big, thick, beautifully bouncy curls!!  Love this product!!"
27,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly Hair Smack,"When I couldn't order my Deja Hair Milk from Bee Mine Organics (RIP), I was in the market for a new leave in. I decided to give this stuff a try. First I want to talk about the smell. It's very candy--like sweet tarts. It gives great slip out of the shower and helps me to detangle--which with my hair--takes forever. It makes my curls look great. I will continue to purchase until I begin to make my own or find a suitable organic alternative."
28,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Glycerin free, protein balanced","This is a nice lightweight leave in with no glycerin and a little bit of protein for balance.  I find I like this for my winter leave in, opting for just a curl cream in the summer.I know brands put scents in their product for an experience, which some I do enjoy, but this one is just kind of bleh in my book. The more products I use the more I appreciate scent free products so that I can add scent when and what I want. Don’t want to clashing with lotions/perfume, etc."
29,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,My must have leave in for curly hair,"Ive been following the curly girl method and this leave in is one of my absolute staples! It’s so moisturizing and helps tame frizz, and does not leave your hair feeling at all oily or like there is a heavy product in it. Depending on how much hair you have/ how much you use, it should last a while. I use this every time I wash my hair and squish to condish it in."
30,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Chamomile,"A little sticky when first applied, but it sinks in after a couple hours and adds a good amount of lightweight moisture to my bleach-damaged hair. I love the intense blue raspberry smell this stuff has right out of the bottle, but once it's on my head a chamomile scent comes out and dominates. I guess that's the 'bliss' part? It's not so terrible that I can't use it, but it's an unpleasant combo and it ruins the candy effect for me."
31,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curls! Smells great!,"Overall, I love this product! It is great for activating curls whether your hair is dry or wet. Personally, I prefer to use it on my hair when it is dry. It smells uniquely delicious too! My only critique of this product is that it does not really improve the overall moisture level of your hair. It dries kind of quickly and if not distributed evenly will leave clumps. As you can see by my picture though, I use it frequently!"
32,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"It smells nice but it isn’t pleasant to use. I like to put this in my hands and with it through. With other leave in conditioners I have used when I do that it doesn’t stay white. This does. When you work it through its fine but my hair was sort of sticky afterwards. When my hair was dried, it was knotted. I don’t like it. In the garbage it went."
33,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Leave In Conditioner I’ve Used,"I have naturally curly hair that’s very prone to frizzing and tangling. I’ve tried multiple different brands of leave in conditioners. Most have with been too thick or too watery or have left my hair stiff or sticky. Not this conditioner. It’s perfect. It helps control the frizz while leaving my hair soft and residue free. Also, the scent is amazing. The only drawback is that I have only been able to find it on Amazon. Highly recommend."
34,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I really loved this when I used it. I have stopped for now because as a new person at the curly girl method, I accidentally protein overloaded myself with other products. Once my hair is ready for a tiny bit of protein, I will be using it again. For now, my hair is falling out from the serious amount of protein I put in my hair! Be carful. This is a great leave in though."
35,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Too heavy and not mixed well,Tried it because I was looking for a product to help my things curly hair. It was just too heavy and weighed my hair down. Wasn't mixed well and had particles in it.
36,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best curl cream ever.,"Omg this makes my hair behave.  Its not oily. Its smells funny but it turns my hair to beautiful curls and just is so nice to have sonething doesnt make my hair grease but doesn't help with control of curl.  And dosent make ur hair hard.  Or dry. It out.  I love this stuff. If u have 4c, hair or 3c I dont think this will work for u , saying this because my son has 4c hair and youngest has 3c, and did nothing for them"
37,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,YES YES YES AAAAAMAZING!!!!,I have very fine thinning hair due to Thyroid issues. I USED to have these great big curly/wavy locks (in my twenties). FINALLY a product that has brought life back to my hair and my curls. I can't stop looking at it because I can't believe something actually worked! After using this i used a light cream gel. LOVING MY HAIR!
38,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,a fragrance that doesn't give me headaches!,This product is a great leave in.  I am ultra sensitive to fragrances.  This has a pleasant blueberry scent that does not overwhelm.  I generally have to get fragrance free shampoos and conditioners- but this did not bother me at all!  I am so pleased to be able to have a little bit of scent in my hair!  It also does not weigh down my wavy/curly hair.
39,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy grail for curls,"I absolutely love this leave in and it will forever be one of my go to products for my 3b/3c thick curls. It leaves my curls frizz free and defined. I use this product and the Novex curls leave in and my hair turns out gorgeous. You can use this alone but I use two products most the time to tame the frizz. The scent is also fruity and doesn't bother me because the product itself is a winner! Helps my hair grow as well :), my hair is now passing my mid back."
40,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Curly Kids,"My daughter has thick corkscrew curls. After reading “Curly Girl Kids”, we switched her to this conditioner And her hair has never been healthier. The hairline frizz she got from humidity is tamed, no more tears when we comb her, and the knots have been reduced by probably 80+ %. It is more expensive than what we were using on a kid before, but a little goes a long way as d it’s well worth it!"
41,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"I've tried a lot of leave-in conditioners and this one if the best. Not only does it smell delicious, but it makes your hair incredibly soft. I only condition my hair in the shower once a week, so if I wash my hair a second or third time that week, I just use this leave-in conditioner. The best part too, it doesn't OVER moisturize your hair and give you that greasy look. I highly recommend!"
42,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it says it'll do,I love this stuff. My curls actually look like curls. I have colored and straightened my hair so I was afraid that I would lose me curl pattern but this stuff always protects my bounce curls!
43,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,TOO expensive,"I would be more than willing to buy this product, but I can't afford to pay $15.00 for an 8oz bottle. These people who say they use an amount ""the size of a dime"" must only be using it on their bangs. My hair isn't even shoulder length, and I probably use at least 2 tablespoons, maybe 3. I do like it, and I think the smell is lovely, but the price is ridiculous for an 8oz bottle, at least for someone on a budget."
44,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells good, lightweight","I returned it. I have very dry hair, that used to be curly. Im losing my curls and I thought this might help. It didn't mositurize my hair well but remember everyone is different and my hair is EXTREMELY dry. Not sure the reason I'm losing my curls but nothing seems to help bring them back."
45,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,My curly hair loves it,"I have curly hair, and have just recently started the curly girl method. My hair that tends to be dry, LOVES this leave in conditioner. It drinks it all up. The first thing I do after I get out of the shower is run this conditioner through my wet hair. Then right afterwards, I put scrunch my hair gel in. It makes my hair so soft and manageable. I loved it so much that I already bought a second bottle to use after I run out of the first bottle. It also smells wonderful, like blueberries and fruit. I HIGHLY recommend this product!"
46,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Unbelievably  Great,"The scent and softness is outstanding.My hair is to my hips and I am constantly  in the sun and pool.But, I use this after the shower and brush it straight while wet and my hair is like velvet when dry.My hair is usually like straw, so this is a miracle for coarse hair."
47,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for fine curly hair,"This product has been great for my hair.  I have fine, curly hair and a lot of products are too heavy for my hair.  This has been great.  After I get my hair wet, I put this on mid-length to ends and comb it through.  Love the blueberry smell, it's not too light or too strong.  Mixes well with my other hair products."
48,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work for me,"Really wanted to like this product. I have tried many different products and recently wanted to find a new one for fizz control and moisturizing for my curls. The smell is super yummy, but the product itself dried out my hair, made it super tangled, and might’ve created more frizz. It did enhance my curls kinda, but not in a good way.Don’t want the product and it’s not letting me return it so very disappointed."
49,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Weighed curls down,"Purchases this with hope my curls would pop, but that wasn't the case. I used it with no other products since thats what I do when I use Mix Chicks leave in conditioner.  My first impression was I LOVE the smell of it. The product is a bit thick, but didn't think much of it. It didn't leave my hair soft, it left it flat and with the feeling of residue. The ends of my curls were frizzy and had to go back a few times to fix them. Was hoping this product really worked since I love the smell."
50,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,This product worked well. It smeels fantastic. Overall it is a good product. Only down fall was it weighed my hair down causing it to look great even when only using a dime size amount.
51,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a full bottle,I like the product but I don’t like the fact there was some missing of the product
52,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,For curly hair of all types,My son decided to grow his hair out to shoulder length.

It's super soft and moisturizing and when twist my kids hair makes the most gorgeous finger curls and holds well"
54,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely is “blueberry bliss”,"Smells amazing! And I’m allergic & picky when it comes to scents. I always apply a small amount on my mid-back length 2A/2B hair after I shampoo and leave it in. It makes my hair very easy to run a wet brush through. And once it dries, my hair feels so soft. Swavy Curly Courtney suggested it!"
55,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably a good product, but not for my hair.","It built up, making my hair stiff, rough, and tangled. It smells good during application, but the smell fades within an hour for me so I didn't really find it important. I have curly hair that varies form loose to tight, with tighter curls (3B-3C) in the back and looser curls (3A-3B) in the front (weird, I know)."
56,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great conditioner- terrible smell,"I really like the conditioner, I like that it's glycerine-free (so many conditioners are not) and has protein. I really do not like the smell though- for an all-natural product, it smells too strong and quite a bit artificial. I'll keep using it, but I do wish the smell wasn't as strong"
57,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sooooo Good!,"I've started the curly girl method to see if my hair will regain some of its curl after years of straightening and this is a highly recommended product in the curly/wavy community so I decided to try it out.CURLS Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave-In Conditioner smells sooooooo good and it leaves my hair feeling so soft!

I don’t see or feel a big difference in the dryness that my curly hair has.The scent is nice. It does work for detangling.

60,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good,"I LOVE the way this smells! It does moisturize my ends and makes my hair soft. I did notice that it did NOT reduce my tangles though, so bummer. I’m still not sure if I’ll try this product again just because I get tangles all the time,  even if I try this. I wish it did because I love the scent. I’ll continue my search."
61,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW!,"I put this in my curls after washing without even really intending for them to look good, I was pleasantly surprised that when they dried, my curls weren't frizzy and were so moisturized and soft.

I have naturally curly hair, but it’s on the thin side, so it didn’t quite work for me. However, these products smell amazing! Maybe it works better on fuller/thicker hair."
71,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,light-weight,"This is perfect for my 3b type hair my hair strands are really fine & certain products can weigh my curls down super fast.

It smells really good and is filled all the way to the cap in the bottle. The actual results are great and its already my favorite product to use on my curls. They make my curls defined and frizz free!! Even after i bleached and box dyed 2x my hair back to brown. Maybe its my recent chop (or both) but my hair looks healthy using this ☺

354,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay Product!,"I have a review on the Curls Twist N Should Glaze Cream.  This product is okay, but it does the same as products that I have purchase that are less inexpensive.  I do recommend that you try it for yourself."

359,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful smelling conditioner,"Love the smell, and it makes my hair feel soft. Needs to be stored upside down or it takes a while to come out of the bottle."
360,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,I did not like it so I ended up giving it away,"Has a slightly weird smell to it.  I did not like it so I ended up giving it away.  Plus, I didn't notice a difference it made compared to my $2.58 OTC brand."
361,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,It instantly gave slip to my 4b/4a hair type. A little goes a long way as long as your hair is wet. I use this product in my every day wash and go routine. I also use in my children hair as well.
362,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,The scent is just too loud and  overpowering,"I don't know exactly how to review this product as it was in my hair for less than 24 hours before I had to wash it out. I'm glad some people like the scent but to me it is atrociously strong. I used the leave-in, along with the gel to do a twist out. To me it smells like really strong blue-raspberry snow cone syrup. When I went to bed the smell literally woke me up all every time I moved my head. The next day I undid my twists to find soft, shiny hair. I would have LOVED this product if not for the scent. I've used Curls brand products before and these would have be my favorite... but the smell...so bad. If you are even remotely sensitive to fragrance, I suggest you look elsewhere."

377,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"I love the smell and it definitely makes my hair softer. It absorbs better into my hair than the other leave in I have. I have very thick, curly natural 3c/4a hair and this does the job. I also prefer this smell to shea butter. And I store it upside down as well. I'm just unsure about the price so I don't use it that often, mainly water and oil"
378,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Why does conditioner contain ALCOHOL?!?,"I purchased this and the Control Jelly for my daughters natural hair. The control Jelly had the ingredients listed, which all sounded fine, but the conditioner didn't. When I received the conditioner I noticed the third and fourth ingredient is ALCOHOL! Why is alcohol in conditioner, let alone 2 of the top ingredients! Alcohol does the opposite of conditioning hair! This product will be going back to Amazon!"
379,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Why does it make my hair smell like freaking mildew?,You that that disgusting smell of mildew if maybe a shirt didn’t dry all the way in the dryer or you left your clothes in the washer a little longer than expected? Or a sponge used a few days longer than maybe you should have ? It’s my least favorite smell in the world. I am so careful to make sure I never have anything left wet so I never have to endure that smell. I used this product for the first time then went to the grocery store. I was walking  around the store and then got a dreaded wiff of that smell! Turns out it was me. All my clothes freshly washed the day before so it was freaking me out not knowing where it was coming from but after changing all my clothes immediately when I got home I smelt it still. Turns out it was my freaking hair!!!! And the only product that I had changed in my routine I’ve had for a year now was adding this product. Thought it couldn’t be right maybe somehow it was my microfiber towel or something. Tried it again air dry same products I usually use. It’s this product. Freaking disgusting. It doesn’t even make my hair look good and I smell like a 2 week old sponge. Nasty
380,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Mildly moisturizing, don’t mix with ecostyler","I love the smell of this product! It’s delightful and smells like blueberries. Not too overwhelming but light enough that it’s noticeable and pleasant. The consistency is like a thick lotion. Overall I find it mildly moisturizing, however, because it’s not heavy, it’s not super moisturizing for drier hair types. I usually pair this with a heavier leave-in or moisturizing product to achieve the moisture that I want in my hair. If I use it alone, my hair still feels a bit dry. It dries very soft though! Also, this product does not play well with any gel other than the Curls gelle, fyi"
381,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesnt Smell Like Blueberries But Still Works,I've had my eye on this leave-in conditioner for a while and I just started using it a couple weeks ago. I have to add it to my top five list of favorite leave-in conditioners. It definitely reduces the frizz and makes detangling smooth and easy. It has a nice smell to it but it doesnt smell like blueberries to me nor does the scent last long. Im okay with that though and I will still use this leave-in conditioner because it works for me.
382,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy grail for curls 🤞🏽,"When I started my natural hair journey I dabbled with “natural” products that just didn’t work for my hair. I was in despair until I found Curls 😭 their products have NEVER failed to make my curls pop and look their best. I like to experiment and try new things, but I will always keep Curls Products on hand bc I KNOW IT WORKS! Plus the fact that the Ingredients are NATURAL and they are BLACK OWNED makes it that much more worth it! I won’t put just anything in my hair, but I trust Curls with every single strand on my head Fr Fr 🤞🏽 Go get you some Curlssssss"
383,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great and smells delicious!,"I have searched for a long time for a leave in product to use while combing through my daughters curly hair, and this one does the trick! It gives just enough slick to avoid some tugging and screaming for my 3 & 5 year olds. The youngest has very curly fine hair and the oldest kinky curly coarse hair. This is the only product I have found to work in BOTH of their heads."
384,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,BUY THIS!,"I've spent a FORTUNE on my curls... for whatever reason I decided to buy this at Target (i think it was like $8). I've been obsessed ever since. It's the ONLY thing that has ever worked for my hair (except for TiGi, but that's like $20 a bottle). I have very frizzy wild spiral curls and this makes my hair look phenomenal - and it smells delicious!"
385,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best leave in ever🥰🥰🥰,Hands-down the best leave in conditioner ever my hair can be so dry and brittle and have so many not just using a little big of it my hair is so silky  smooth again.

I posted about it on Instagram yesterday. It’s the only leave in that works for my hair. One time I went to multiple targets to see if they had it because I couldn’t find it anywhere. If I could buy a whole packet of this product I would. It’s really moisturizing and affordable. It’s also black owned which makes it even better 🙌🏾

388,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great leave in!,I love this leave in conditioner! I wash my hair every week and then blow dry it.

396,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok but there are better leave ins out there,I found the smell overwhelming especially since I try to find products that work for me and my son. I found that my hair required a lot more product to feel moisturized.
397,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Shea moisture is a far superior brand. I won't be repurchasing,This product works well but it's definitely overrated. Shea moisture is a far superior brand. I won't be repurchasing.

410,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for the Curly Girl Method,"I've been blessed/cursed with the world's most picky curly hair. I have to use apple cider vinegar and silicone free conditioner in the shower, because every kind of shampoo turns my hair into straw. This leave in is one of the rare types that's both affordable and silicone free that I can use. It smells like blueberries (think blueberry candy), which compliments the coconut smell from my rinse out conditioner, and you only need a little to get the job done. It'll take a while for me to use a whole bottle, but I'm definitely buying again."
411,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for wavy/ curly hair,"I have 2b wavy hair, high porosity and fine.  This leave in conditioner is great for moisture and light protein, smells great and works well.  I don't use allot as it will weigh down my fine hair.  I'm kind of picky about volume though so you might find it perfect! I also use as an overnight treatment and rinse in the morning. I use just a little for refresh days if my hair is tangled."
412,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best curling product I’ve found!,"This is the absolute best product I found for my natural curls and waves.

413,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Will Buy again,Does what it’s supposed to. I then use with the gel. Great smell. Although someone told me it smelled like alcohol after I applied it. I smell blueberries.
414,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for moisturizing,I love this stuff. I use it after washing as my leave in.

This product is the first thing I have tried that has actually made my hair feel hydrated and not just greasy/oily. It’s very easy to apply and it keeps my curls textured and soft. I have a wavy to curly (2b/2C) hair pattern and I highly recommend this for people like me.

423,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Soybean oil main ingredient,I can't believe I paid this price for something that uses soybean oil as the main ingredient. That's ridiculous. I'm not putting soy straight on my scalp. That's the last thing a woman should be doing. Threw this in the trash. Waste of money.
424,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a great product,It’s a great product
425,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"All curly girls recommend this and now I see why, great to help define curls but doesn't weigh them down and it smells amazing"
426,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"It doesn't seem so bad, but the chemical they've used to replace the preservative is Pheoxyethanol, which has shown to be ""drying to the strands and scalp. But more notably, it's highly toxic to human health and causes hair loss."" If you're like me and trying to cultivate long term hair health. Then DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. I'm sure all the 5 star reviews are from people satisfied with the short term results, in fact I would have been one of them. But it is just another one of those nasty products that says its good but has other unforeseen ingredients that do long term damage to hair and health."
427,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This product is great especially if you are trying to follow the curly girl method. It has no glycerin which makes it a great option for low dew points. Its super hydrating and makes your curls amazingly soft. I highly recommend wet plopping with this product because it will give you great results. Overall very happy with this purchase and it smells great!
428,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I purchased this product because I saw that it was Curly Girl method approved and it looked great ingredient-wise. To my delight, it has lived up to what I hoped it would be! You only need a little and some water and it really does make my hair softer and my curls a bit more defined. I love this stuff even though it's my first Curly Girl leave-in I'll be buying this again for sure. I have really long hair and so I use a little more product than others (mainly Youtuber's who have shoulder length hair) and it doesn't weigh my hair down, I've also barely used any of it after 10 washes so this will last you a long long time - definitely at least 3 months worth in this bottle depending on your wash routine. - Rachel"
429,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I have low porosity hair and mainly use co-washing or no sulfate cleansing until i need to remove buildup. Both of these things can mean that my hair has some difficulty absorbing conditioners. But so far this one has been working really well for me! I love the smell and my hair feels soft and moisturized!(I have also heard that this product works re for high porosity hair for those wondering)
430,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I don’t know if this product is the real or fake one, cuz it did not do what it said it would do, it dried my hair, no moisture at all and my curls would just drop immediately. So not worth the money . I use now African pride Shea leave in conditioner  and and so far much better my hair is soft when applied on both wet and dry hair and my curls would stay all day with out any additions curling products and half the price."
431,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I have fine wavy hair, with some small curl coils underneath, I have tried this product in my soaking wet hair but ended up with stringy, barely wavy - straight hair after both air drying and diffusing, left my hair pretty soft but not what I wanted. It's a shame because lots of fine wavy haired girls rave about this product... I'm disappointed."
432,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I’m always on the hunt for CG approved hair products that work for my baby fine, thin 2b/2c curls.  Most are just way too heavy for my hair type and leave my hair feeling too full of product.  This one hit the spot.  Left my hair soft and manageable.  Perfect for my hair and is going to be a firm regular from now on."
433,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I have 2C - 3A type hair and this product really encourages the curl. I use just a little after my hair has sat in a turban for 30 minutes to part dry. When fully dry my hair is full of ringlets. This lasts for days; I just spritz my hair with water to revive it.Well worth the cost.
434,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I have used this product a few times now and I love it. It smells lovely, it helps detangle my hair and I would buy it again."
435,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Is just amazing.The smell is great the hair after is healthy, light and soft and really helps growing the hair"
436,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I didn’t use it because it smelt sooooo sweet. It was sickening. I’m sensitive to that anyway but if you don’t like sweet smells stay away. I also don’t want such strong fragrance in my hair. It’s not good for it.
437,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Brilliant product, isnt sticky and goes into my hair with no nasty chemical feel. When I leave my hair try naturally there ois no frizzy hair and my hair looks shiny, which for naturally curly hair isn't common. Smells amazing product!"
438,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I started thinking my low porosity hair was impenetrable, not a drop of moisture could enter these shafts. 30 something years of dry crisp hair obliterated by a tsunami of moisture from this product. Thank you hair gods!"
439,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Leaves my hair feeling very soft and moisturised. Order also arrived earlier than anticipated.
440,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This product quenches your hair without weighing it down. The protein helps repair and curl hold but os not too stong. The scent is not too strong. My favourite CGM approved product so far!!
441,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Lovely scent, leaves hair soft and manageableThis product is amazing, it defines my curls and leaves my hair smelling divine. A little goes a long way, good value for money.Highly recommend!!"
442,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This is expensive but is worth the price. It’s good for hair growth and detangling and a little goes a long way. Will buy again. Only thing is the coconut. Why do many natural hair products have to have coconut? Could do without
443,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Curls blueberry bliss reparative leave in conditioner is perfect for my hair, it leaves my thick hair well moisturised and smelling nice, I have no regrets buying this product"
444,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Not what I expected. Scent is a bit rancid which is disappointing as the cleansing shampoo and conditioner smells amazing. Other than that it’s just okay to be honest.
445,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Very nice smelling, my hairs noticeably softer. Big fan, will be purchasing again."
446,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Love this product my curls. I leave it in and defines the curls really well. Smells great too.
447,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"This is a con, the labels look like they are printed on a home computer with the ink running out and it was sealed with a piece of dusty sellotape!"
448,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Great hair product - Used a replacement for a detangler and this did the job perfectly. Could be a touch thicker and spread a little further but my afro is pretty long and curly
449,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I love this product. It has the perfect consistency for my hair. I use other products from this company too and since I’ve been using them I’ve noticed a big improvement with the quality of my hair.
450,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I love this product. It smells nice and makes my curls feel soft and defined. I will order more when the time comes. Thank you.

462,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Good for my sons curly hair
463,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,The best product for frizzy hair.
464,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"What an amazing leave in conditioner. It left my hair feeling extremely soft, hydrated and with defined, frizz free curls! Now a staple, holy grail piece in my curly hair journey!!"
465,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,smells beautiful and leaves your hair very soft .
466,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I was very excited to try this product after hearing rave reviews within the curly girl community so I gave it a go.  First off it smells absolutely delicious (kind of like a blueberry popsicle). I have a lot of difficulty with perfumes and try to avoid at all costs. I’m not sensitive to this particular scent however the smell is very strong so if you have scent sensitivities You may want to steer clear.  I’ve used this a couple of times now but haven’t found it to be that great. I found my hair to be heavy and lacklustre after using and my hair was quite oily by day 2. Keep in mind I’ve only been following the CGM for about a month so my hair is still transitioning and being very temperamental. All in all it’s worth a try. (FYI a little goes a very long way so don’t use too much at a time)
467,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"So... this was a disappointment. I’ll tell you why, as soon as I applied this product to my hair my hair went limp and greasy. I get out of the shower, start air drying, 5 minutes in and my hair starts to frizz up, to the point I look absolutely crazy. I went in and washed the product out because there’s no way I’m waiting until the next wash day. My guess is this product is either a knock out and have heavy silicones in it which made my hair weigh down and puff up, or simply a bad batch/expired product. (Also I want to add that I searched the products barcode in a website and its UPC didn’t match with anything.)  I usually know what I’m doing when it comes to curly hair and this was just a no-go. Also it’s wayyy more expensive than the original price and in my opinion there are better options you can find here on Amazon. I wouldn’t recommend giving this a go, but then again, take my review with a grain of salt and do as you wish."
468,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I've been using CURLS Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave-In Conditioner for over a year. My shoulder-length hair is Type 2B, 50% coarse grey, and the other 50% is like super fine baby hair. I use a very small amount after my co-wash (a marble-sized dollop). If I use too much (two dollops), my hair is quite greasy by day 2. Less is more, at least in my case. This product is just light enough to be the perfect product for me. There may be cheaper out there, but I'm not willing to find out. I'm hooked!"
469,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Super Produkt für feine Locken!!! Das Leave In ist super leicht und beschwert meine Locken nicht. Ich hatte vorher Cantu benutzt und war nicht zufrieden. Jetzt kringeln sich meine locken endlich wieder unbeschwert. Ich benutzte ea im Rahmen der curly girl methode. Der Duft ist sehr süß, aber dennoch angenehm. Ich werde es wieder bestellen. Ich bin einfach nur glücklich damit."
470,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"It leaves the hair soft but It isn’t the best product I’ve tried, you can get same results with products of cheaper price. For the price I was expecting a better product."
471,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Im new to the Curly Girl scene. Im a wavy! I watched a couple of videos on what to do and not to do and bought a couple of basic products. This stuff is great~ scrunch it in damp wet hair and pin a couple of top sections up. I let dry naturally and within half an hour it has a gentle hold for the rest of the day. I have quite fine hair, so this might not be the case for thinker, heavier hair. I also use it as a styling prep if Im doing something fancier to my hair. And use it as a detangled for my daughter. And the price is great."
472,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Il miglior leave in per capelli ricci provato fino ad ora, i miei capelli tendono generalmente ad appesantirsi con l'uso di altri leave in, invece utizzando questo in combo con  il gel di Cantu o ancora meglio con il gel di Bounce Curl i miei ricci si nutrono, no effetto crespo, ricci morbidi ma definiti, idradati! Davvero consigliato"
473,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"its a fine leave in conditioner as it doesn't leave a greasy residue. But for 30$  I would expect more. Been using it since August and i don't think my hair is more repaired, and doesn't really enhance my curls. Smell is also weak. I had high hopes for this since so many people swear by it."
474,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Ich liebe dieses Produkt. Man muss etwas aufpassen, dass man nicht zu viel nimmt, sonst sehen die Haare fettig aus. Ich persönlich nehme das Produkt und verreibe es mit ordentlich Wasser in den Händen und arbeite es dann in die Haare ein. Der Glanz ist Wahnsinn, die Kämmbarkeit toll und auch der Geruch so angenehm. Vor allem zum refresh von Locken und Welleb ein paar Tage nach dem Waschen ist es besonders geeignet. Ich werde es immer wieder bestellen."
475,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Incredible product. My daughter has fine, mixed curly hair. I have never been able to comb my fingers through her wet hair as it tangles easily. This product made it so easy to refresh her hair! I'm just annoyed that I waited so long to try it. Don't hesitate. Worth every penny. Very little needed to detangle and moisturize."
476,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Das Produkt hat einen herrlichen Duft (ich war zunächst besorgt, dass es irgendwie “kaugummiartig“ riecht, weil ich das überhaupt nicht leiden kann) und eine eher flüssige Konsistenz. Es versorgt meine sehr spröden locken mit feuchtigkeit, wie es soll. Allerdings hilft es nicht, die locken zu definieren oder die sprungkraft zu verbessern, es legt lediglich die frizzigen babyhärchen an. Im ansatz nimmt es bei mir etwas Volumen raus, also eher in den Längen auftragen.Trotzdem werde ich es wieder kaufen, als reinen Feuchtigkeitsspender."
477,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I have been wanting to try this product for some time.  I recently started using Kinky Curly Knot Today...which is great...but...Curls Blueberry Bliss is even better!  AMAZING slip...I can actually brush through my wet curly waist length hair in the shower in under 5 minutes.  And the way this leaves my curls soft and silky...I love it.  I will be trying more products from this line!  I am 2C, 3A, 3B curls.  I'd recommend this for all curl types...it's creamy and thick but not heavy or greasy.  LOVE IT!"
478,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I have high porosity curly hair and nothing moistures my hair more than this leave in.. Amazing slip! Have tried many leave-ins but this is my best.. And the beautiful smell stays in hair, makes you loves your hair more!"
479,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I’m 3b-3c curls and my hair is quite thick. It did literally nothing to my hair even after using different techniques of application and changing up the other products I use with it. I gave it to my friend who has thinner and lighter curl strands and she loves it. Also not a fan of the smell, it’s very 90’s or early 2000’s if that makes sense haha"
480,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Tengo cabello tipo 3A y éste Leave-in ha sido una maravilla pues siento mi rizado muy humectado. El hecho de que tenga proteína (Silk protein) ayuda a que mi cabello absorba mejor la hidratación. En general me gusta aunque no me encanta que sea cremoso pues en ocasiones siento que deja mi cabello un poco tieso si uso demasiado.
481,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Für mein Haar (2b/3a, zu Frizz neigend) sehr gut geeignet. Es spendet viel Feuchtigkeit ohne die Haare ölig zu machen. Die Locken sind weich und halten gut. Der Geruch des Conditioners ist zu süß und nicht angenehm,  am Haar selbst ist der Geruch jedoch kaum wahrnehmbar."
482,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Ottimo prodotto, lascia i capelli morbidissimi e idratati. Lo uso prima del gel ed è perfetto. La profumazione è fantastica. Non do 5 stelle solo perché il tappo mi è arrivato rotto ed è un po' complicato farlo uscire."
483,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Purchased for transitioning to the CGM at the recommendation of SwavyCurlyCourtney on YouTube. Amazing scent that lasts for days in my fine hair, plays well with other products and great for fine, thin hair."
484,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This is hair beautiful. It has a faint smell of blueberry. It is thick and milky. It is a leave in wet hair conditioner but I have used it on dry as anti fly away frizz. Love this just wish the bottle was larger.
485,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Costa tanto, ma penso sia molto utile per districare e nutrire i capelli dopo il lavaggio. Ha un buon odore e una consistenza non troppo liquida, cosa che consente di distribuirlo su tutte le lunghezze con grande facilità. Odore molto buono, non fastidioso"
486,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I've only used it a few days.  I have fine (sort of) wavy hair and it does leave it fuller.  I haven't notice much more curl but it does smell very nice.  I would order again.
487,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Ist ganz okay, aber für das Geld hab ich irgendwie mehr erwartet... auch nicht besser als die günstigen Alternativen.Nachtrag: macht die Haare total trocken nach einer Weile."
488,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Curls sorgt für extrem sanfte Haare und macht sie dabei nicht zu ölig. Der Geruch ist ein wenig gewöhnungsbedürftig aber auf keinen Fall schlecht. Super Qualität aber mit fast 18 Euro ein wenig teuer.
489,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"My low porosity flat fine waves love it, they can get definitely curlier with this. I was using this product every wash day until I cut my hair above the shoulder. Now I need to be careful with the amount I put on my hair and put it less often otherwise it csn weight down my fine thin short hair. For sure a great product for medium to long hair."
490,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Das Produkt ist ausgeronnen und die ganzr Packung war voll mit der Leave-In Creme.So viel kann ich sagen, das Produkt riecht unangenehm süß.Werde es zurückschicken."
491,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I have a very thick 3b curly, low porosity hair and this works amazingly with it. I usually wash my hair every 5-6 days and it leaves my hair very moisturized for the whole period"
492,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,It can make your hair greasy if you use more than you need but when you use the right amount it really helps control your frizz and leaves your hair smelling nice. It has a good amount of slip for a silicone free conditioner.
493,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,It was amazing at first but after a few days my daughters hair became extremely tangled and dry !!! Don’t use :(
494,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I have 4A type hair, this product  it’s very moisturizing. I totally love it. It’s a bit expensive but I guess I have to sacrifice to keep my hair healthy."
495,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Mir gefällt der Geruch und das Produkt an sich sehr gut, allerdings habe ich mehr erwartet. Die Locken bleiben nicht so ganz in Form. Jedoch wird das Haar wunderbar geschützt"
496,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Einen besseren Leave-in habe ich noch nicht erlebt. Das Geruch ist ein bisschen too much, aber ansonsten passt alles: Die Locken sehen schön aus und bleiben am nächsten Tag in Form."
497,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Moisturizes fine. Doesn’t make a difference for my curls. The blueberry smell isn’t what I expected, it smells kind of weird. For 30$ it wasn’t what I expected"

502,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Too heavy and doesn’t feel like it absorbs, just feels like it sits on the hair. Smell is nice though."

505,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This product doesn‘t really do anything to define my waves. After my hair dries it just looks really straight and slightly frizzy. And the blueberry scent also goes away as soon as my hair dries.
506,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Ich bin total enttäuscht. Es macht furchtbare Haare.

It defines all the curls without weighing them down and smells AMAZING. It also lasts for a few days, which is always a plus for curly hair."
1,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but not economical,"I love this product and it smells nice too.  It was sticky to me...feels better tgan ecostyler gel.  It leaves a soft hold unlike ecostyler.  I don't know if I'll continue to use because of the price and how much I use for one wash n go(see pic), but I use way less of this product than when I use ecostyler.  I give it a 4 out of 5 due to high price and small quantity. The end...😜"
2,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,WHOA!!!!,"I’ll admit, I was skeptical to try this. Been eye balling this for 2yrs? I finally caved and decided to try this and OMGOODNESS I LOVE it! I have a mix of 3b & 3c medium coarse, low porosity curls. This left my curls rrrrrealy defined! My curls are shiny but not oily shiny! Not sticky, curls are held but not a crunchy-hard hold. A little goes a LONG way! I also paired it with the repairative leave-in conditioner, and applied both while my hair was wet, not damp or towled dried (dripping wet). Now imma have to try other products along this blueberry line. The only thing left is to see if it’ll hold up during a workout and during summers in Italy!"
3,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Stuff!!,This product is beyond amazing! I’ve tried so many organic products in my hair and they were all too thick and heavy and had strong smell. This stuff is so light in both scent and texture. This is now my permanent and favorite hair product.
4,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but I wish it didn't have fragrance,"EDITED REVIEW: The smell of this product is powerful, no doubt. If scents give you migraines, don't open this and inhale deeply. At first, I was put off with how strongly this smelled and it sat on my shelf for a month. Then, on a good day where my head felt fine, I decided to give it a try. This stuff is amazing at encouraging curls and it is very lightweight! It is now my go-to wintertime product and the smell fades when the product dries, so it's not a problem for me. For reference, I am type 2B-C, very low porosity, fine hair, with low density. I use about 1-2 tablespoons each time, scrunch a little bit, plop in a tshirt towel for an hour, then air dry the rest of the way and scrunch out the crunch. I think that it's possible that porosity and strand thickness have more to do with what stylers to use rather than texture, as there are many people with varied textures who love this product. It's definitely worth a try."
5,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,A curly girl's best friend!,"Love, love, LOVE this stuff for my wash and go! I used Curl Control Paste before, but I like this even better! It gives shine, hold, and definition!"
6,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Brought back my curl in one use!,"I'm not sure what my curl type is, but unstyled, my hair wants to form big, chunky ringlets about an inch in diameter. Two years ago, I ditched my semi-nice hair products and started buying really cheap shampoo/conditioners, and now my hair is a mess. My hair is flat and frizzy and is the most fragile it's ever been (it seems like I just touch it and it starts making these awful elastic snapping sounds). I decided that, unless I want to wear a pixie cut my whole life, I'm going to have to fork over some cash to keep my curls happy.I found Blueberry Bliss, read the reviews, and went all in; I ordered nearly the entire line of products. Unfortunately, they all shipped at different times (I won't get the hair wash for another month. Oops!), and this styling jelly arrived first. I put about a quarter-sized amount in my hair. I was actually put off by the fragrance: it's a very strong artificial fruity scent. (My boyfriend likes the smell, though, so maybe it's just a me problem)Guys, my curls are back! I have chunky ringlets again! My hair feels light and bouncy, not oily, slick, crunchy, crispy...it doesn't feel like I put any product in. I'm looking forward to the staggered arrival of the rest of this line, because if it works anything like the curl jelly, I have a hope that my cheap-shampoo-fried hair will be back to glossy curls soon. I'm so excited! I definitely recommend this product."
7,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite Hair Gel.,"I am addicted!  This has great hold and is not stiff. I love the fragrance. I do think it is too expensive for the ingredients and the amount. Nonetheless I keep buying, if that tells you anything. I highly recommend. I have 4c hair."
8,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected at all,"This product did not work well for me at all. After co-washing, I sectioned my hair and applied the Blueberry Bliss leave in, and then applied this control jelly, by the time I got to the third section of hair, I had little white hard balls of what felt like crisco all over my hands and in my hair. They are two products that are supposed to work together, so I finished my hair out and hoped the white stuff would somehow soak in during drying, it did soak in, but my hair came out horrible. It was sticky and fuzzy frizzy at the same time, if that is even possible. It did not give me near the gel cast I need for my super thick, very curly, coarse hair, and the smell left a lot to be desired. A lot of the reviews rave about the smell, not a fan.Very disappointing. Going to probably send it back."
9,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,"I have fine, high porosity, 2b wavy hair for reference. This is ok, not as amazing as I had hoped. I felt like it was similar to kinky curly’s original curling custard. This doesn’t make my curl clumps as big as KCOCC, but it does have a similar look and dries faster, which is nice. It is a nice product though, and I’m going to play around with it some more!"
10,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,MIRACLE HAIR PRODUCT,"GIRL. you gotta get this product RIGHT NOW.this is NOT a paid review.I really wish I would have found this product sooner. I've tried Miss Jessie's (I like Pillow Soft Curls but the amount I need to use is ridiculous; and I hated the Jelly Curls product). I've tried Cantu (again, I liked it...at first. I found it started drying my hair out). I went most of my life just leaving regular people conditioner in my hair as a styler. But soon enough my curls started getting messed up due to my terrible treatment of them. There was barely any curl or life left when I found this wonderful miracle worker and I will NEVER, I mean NEVER look back!!!Baby this stuff smells AMAZING. AND IT IS SO MF MOISTURIZING!!!! Not to mention, do you see the CURL DEFINITION!? Do you understand that this pic was after ONE USE of this miraculous product? That my curls were near NONEXISTANT and then I put this stuff in and BOOOM baby I got ringlets again. GOOD SMELLING RINGLETS from GOOD HAIR INGREDIENTS. I MEAN CAN IT GET ANY BETTER?? I will buy this again and again and again and again. And I'll add another, better picture after a few weeks using this product because I'm pretty sure this is just the beginning of a beautiful new relationship blossoming between me and my hair."
11,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"this was my first time using this.  Mind you, I’ve been wanting to try this for years!  Soooo glad I finally got it.  It made my curls look so nice!  I used it to refresh my curls on day 3 along with the blueberry leave in and WOW!  I am so impressed.  Why did I wait this long to try it?  It’s a keeper for sure.  Also, it smells like blueberry icey, but sadly, it doesn’t linger.  I wouldn’t mind smelling like a blueberry icey.I refreshed my curls by spraying myHair with water that has a few drops of lavender oil in it.  Then I ran the blueberry bliss leave in throughout my hair and finger detangled.  Once I finger detangled, I scrunched the jelly through my hair.  Flipped my hair and added some more.  Then I diffused upside down.  Then I used a pick to to add volume at the top."
12,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Nope,"I wanted to like this product so bad. The first day I tried it, it made my hair look and feel really dry. So I wondered if I used it along with the Curls leave in conditioner maybe I'd have better results. So I ran to Target and grabbed the leave in. The next day, I applied the leave in, and it made my hair sooo soft. Then, as soon as I put in the jelly, my hair immediately felt dried out. I was heading to work, and by the end of the day my hair was so frizzy. I would have probably looked better if I hadn't put any product in my hair.  End of story, the leave in is great, but I would not recommend the jelly. I have 3b mixed race hair."
13,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced and not a great match with finer 2c/3b hair,"I know a lot of people love this product but other than the smell, I am not a fan. I have 2c/3a combo low-porosity fine-ish hair that is just past the shoulders and struggles to obtain volume. Aussie Instant Freeze has been my most favorite gel until recently as it has started flaking and I’m not sure why.  I bought this gel 3 days ago and have used it daily since. The first day, wash day, I used it with the Curls creme brûlée cream which has always worked wonderfully for me. That pair oddly made my hair greasy and weighed down. I wetted my whole head the next day, detangled & scrubbed my scalp a bit with just water to try to loosen up my roots and I reapplied a little more gel to tone down the frizz, as I usually would with Aussie. My curls felt weighed down and lifeless. I repeated this process this morning, using a even less gel than yesterday and it really left my hair lackluster and frizzy. I did a full wash and applied only the gel with no leave-ins or creams. I diffused for a while hoping that would give me some volume and tame the frizz, to no avail. About halfway through diffusing I threw some alcohol free hair spray on there to, again, help control the frizz. I suppose it’s toned down a bit but it’s left my roots very flat and the texture of my hair feels almost chalky. I’ve also gone through 1/4 of the bottle of gel in 3 days. All of this to say, I will return to my search for a gel that doesn’t flake, doesn’t weigh my hair down, and creates a better cast. This one just doesn’t cut it for me."
14,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,"This stuff smells yummy, but that’s all it’s got going for it. My hair is a 2C & it’s fine. It makes it frizzy & feels really dry. There was no control at all! I used it in combination with the blueberry bliss hair wash & conditioner. My hair felt even finer & looked terrible. Like all products it takes time so I kept trying. Finally defeated I went back to my previous products & It took a week for my hair to look & feel healthy."
15,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,A bit too thick for me...,"So...I think your desire for gel thickness will determine if you like this particular gel.First the good things - it smells great. This has a nice light scent. It also creates and holds curls pretty well IF you need a heavier gel (I do not hence the score).Now the cons, this is pretty thick. When I use it (because I hate to waste products), I tend to water it down (with water) to make it easier to spread and less likely to clump in my curls. I prefer to thinner gel (like Jane Carter). If you have thicker hair or a tighter curl pattern and need a heavier gel, this may work for you - it might just be experimentation. When I thin it out with water, it works just fine."
16,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Formed nice curls, but frizzy. Not for my hair type.","I heard good things - so I wanted to try. It did help get my hair get nice and curly but because it has protein, it caused my hair to have a lot of frizz. I also did not like the texture it left on my hair. Perhaps other people have different results because their hair is unlike mine. I am assuming I don’t need products with added protein in them. I use a different product, mop top curl custard, and I do not get frizz and I do get nice soft curls. The cast scrunches out nice with that product too. My hair details: low porosity, high density, thick, coarse, 2c/3a curl type. As noted, the product holds well in my hair- but I had to use A LOT- but it caused much frizz and made my curls feels dry. Likely because I have enough protein in my hair and I don’t need more. Also, while others may enjoy the smell, I do not. It smells like a very fake scented candy and chemicals."
17,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,"Saw this reviewed on BuzzFeed, and I fell for the hype. I imagine the manufacturer paid for it to be included. Shame on me. This product has no hold, and did nothing to stop frizz or enhance curls. I've used some of it, but I'm going to throw away the rest.I will go back to DevaCurl or Bumble & Bumble."
18,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,STINKY,"Ladies I would not recommend this product. I have curly hair so thought this was an answer. First, the smell!  Somewhere between stinky feet or worse. It is not a pleasant smell. Quite offending. I went anyway and gave it a whirl. It makes your hair very sticky and greasy feeling. I could not wait to wash it out. Sorry I had to return it. This product does not work or smell well."
19,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,4/5 for the Price,"I have been skeptical of this product and Curls products in general for the past years, but chile this product is amazing. It is thicker than regular gels like ecostyler and has a more paste like texture. But it is so lightweight and holds curls so well. I got minimal to no frizz and have a mix between 4b-4c. Can't wait to buy more in a couple months because its expensive."
20,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,You’ve got to try this!!,"I bought this on a whim, after using DevaCurl gels the last few years. I was surprised to see how well this gel is to work with on  my long wavy silver hair and isn’t sticky or tacky. It also leaves my hair frizz free, and dries with a moderate cast that shakes out beautifully and it smells delicious😋. Most importantly, my waves are bouncy, and last for days...like 5-6 days better than DevaCurl gel. To revive any squashed sections after sleeping, I use a nickel sized amount in one hand, wet the other hand, squish the now diluted gel into the sections and voila...gorgeous. Try it out for yourself, you’ll love it too! It’s my new go to!"
21,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells good, sticky, difficult to pour from bottle","As other reviews have mentioned, the smell is great. I use a natural remedy (puréed onions) to treat dandruff, and this greatly helps in masking the scent. I use it in conjuction with the Curls blueberry mint scalp oil.The texture is quite sticky, very much like a gel. Because of the consistency, it doesn't pour well from the bottle. I actually have to close the lid and shake the bottle to get product close enough to squeeze out. Added, the bottle is not “squeezable” so it’s a bit of a pain to deal with.Lastly, this left a caked residue in my hair after it dried. Not sure if its because I also use the scalp oil with it, but it wasnt a good look.I really enjoy the scent, hate the bottle and wil try using it without the scalp oil to see if that resolves the residue."
22,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well & smells amazing!,The blueberry smell to this is AMAZING! I use this after using a cream and it works so well. Not too sticky which is exactly what I look for in a product as I don't like the feel of gel weighing me down. It's super light yet still sticky enough to style my curls. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a new gel!
23,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny,"Just like other reviewers have said, this stuff is very light weight but has amazing control. My hair is 2B to 2C and medium thickness. A lot of products for curly hair are too thick/heavy for me and paste my hair to my head. This holds my curls and still leaves them bouncy. I usually diffuse, but am very curious what air drying would do! It is a little pricey, but I think its worth it as my curls look good at for at least 2 days. The third day, I can wear it up and it still looks ""done"". The weird blueberry smell goes away quickly, so it's not an issue at all."
24,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it !!!,Smells good and WORKS AMAZING with the 1st time ONLY !!! I haven't seen my curly hair for 10 years plus ....I've always straightened or curl it and I needed to take a break til I found curls ...read ppls reviews pictures and OAlaaaa I purchased 2 one for me and 1 for my mother. The price it's pricey for the small bottle but hey it works on the 1st try only! 😉
25,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Didnt work for me. 2b lo porosity.,"I have 2b low porosity very dense waves. I usually use KCCC by itself but I wanted to try this paired with it for a stronger hold since it's a ""clean"" curly girl approved gel. I tried it on a wash day. It smelled amazing. It had great hold. However my waves fell out and this product left build up even after my next lo poo day. Reading ingredients it has lots of heavy butters and oils which makes it less than ideal for my hair type. This would probably work better on someone with more coarse hair, tighter curl pattern or higher porosity. It smelled so good though. Like blueberry pie. Wish it would have worked for me."
26,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"I bought this based on the recommendations. I guess I am not a ""food/dessert"" scent liking person, so this ended up being cloyingly sweet and not my cup of tea. It worked like it said it would do. Also, my cap arrived broken, so I can't really cap it up, defeating the purpose of protecting your styling products. Overall, scent became the main factor for me and I just stopped using it before really testing it out to see if it worked well. (Also, I know that it was blueberry scented, but I did not think it would be SO blueberry scented as I do like blueberry scents.)"
27,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,"I really, really REALLY wanted to love this","I used this a couple times and wasn't really that impressed.  I've used a less expensive beauty store brand with better results.  The blueberry smell is great if you don't use other scented products and it did curly my hair a little. I have naturally curly hair and it responds well to water and a good gel... This one didn't really ""do it"" for me.  I'm keeping it as a one of those last resort items when I run out of my favorites.  It's not terrible, my hair just didn't like it."
28,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Holds well and smells nice but leaves your hair feeling greasy and dirty.,"Let me start this off by saying that I do not have greasy hair. In fact my hair is prone to dryness. The stuff smells nice, it looks pretty, blends well, dries quickly. The biggest problem is it leaves your hair greasy and dirty. And no, I am not using too much. Regardless of how little I used, it still feels greasy. I would avoid. Garnier fructis curl crunch works better."
29,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"I love this paired with the Rizos Curl cream. It smells so good, almost like blue jolly ranchers. The texture is like a real jelly, and it can create a nice cast that can be left or scrunched out. It has nice hold with no flaking. I love this stuff. Does have protein though, so low porosity girls like me (2C/3A) need to be careful."
30,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Great but...,Make sure your hair is wet before applying works much better after a fresh water. Damp or dry hair will cause you to use much more of the product and possibly cause breakage due to the product being a little sticky and makes your hair stiff if applied dry. The price is pretty steep so apply correctly and make sure YOUR HAIR IS WET BEFORE APPLYING
31,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,but didn't give me the greatest results. Not worth the smell,"The smell is so strong and not pleasant to me. The product works reasonably well, but didn't give me the greatest results. Not worth the smell. I will keep it on hand as like a backup if I run out of my regular stuff. I saw a lot of curly girls recommend this, but my hair didn't love it."
32,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,This is my new go to product!!,"For me, this jelly is the BEST I’ve used for my 2b waves.  And I’ve tried a lot of different kinds!  It’s not just that the hold is good, it’s also that this gel seems to enhance and support good curl/wave.  The smell is not the worst thing ever but it’s not great. The good thing though is that the smell dissipates quickly as your hair dries.  So I have no problem putting up with the smell to get these amazing results."
33,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor,"It’s a very rough product, I put a quarter size amount on my hand and scrunched it on my fresh out the shower wet hair. It’s so rough that I can not run my hands throughout my hair. From the reviews ppl said it wasn’t heavy, but it’s the opposite. My hair is very curly and fluffy & this product made my hair stiff and did not allow my hair to curl at all, made my ends of my hair stiff and flat."
34,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls are popping,"Order cake on time and neatly packed to avoid damaging. I use this product in the shower right after I wash my hair. Some reviews complain about the smell, however I enjoy the smell. I use this product with combination of miss Jessie pillow soft curls and I find it helps control frizz. With the combination I can go 4 days without reapplying product, I just spray my hair with water to refresh any frizzy curls."
35,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Type 4 Hair,"My curls and coils love, love, love this stuff. This is the ONLY jelly that my hair responds well to. I have type 4 hair and other gels dry out my hair and flake. I use this product after the curling cream for a nice moisturized hold and I follow up with the blueberry bliss moisturizing spray."
36,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,happy with the frizzy control and curl definition.,"My daughters hair is really curly and will almost always get frizzy. I have been constantly looking for a product that will help at least control the frizz and give her more definition. This product, by far, has started doing what I want it to do and giving us some hope of control. The final result gives her a natural controlled curl look.  really like it."
37,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy,I saw this product as highly recommended but it just doesn't work well for my hair. It's heavy and on day two really makes my hair feel gross. Is still try other of their products but not a fan of this one. Also not a huge fan of the blueberry scent. If you're into sweet then it'll be your jam (get it?!) But I don't like it.
38,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Too heavy for my hair,I have fine wavy hair and a lot of it and was looking for a product to control my frizz and tighten my curl. This product wasn't it. I liked the way it smelled but it was too heavy for my hair and ended up making my hair feel crunchy and dry.
39,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Light/medium hold,Just want to let it be known that this does not smell like blueberry. It smells like a blue raspberry popsicle if anyone is familiar with fla•vor•ice. I don’t mind the scent because it is mild and fades.  However it provides too little hold for me. I have 2b/fine/low porosity hair and I typically like a strong gel to SOTC. I have to use a LOT of this product to get a medium hold so I’ll probably go through it quickly which doesn’t make it worth it to me because of the price. I’m going to experiment more with it but probably won’t be repurchasing. Maybe it would work better for a different hair type/porosity
40,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't hold and smelled bad,This didn't have any hold at all and my hair frizzed bad. I have the leave-in conditioner (blueberry bliss) and it didn't smell much like it and had an off-putting alcohol smell. I don't know if it was just my bottle that wasn't right or if that's just what this product is like.
41,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair dry,"Smell is wonderful but doesn't last very long.  I have multi-textured  hair 3c,4a and 4c.  It made my very hair dry and added no shine.  I normally use Eco  or Gorilla Snot and neither of those dries out my hair they way this did.  Unfortunately it is not the product for me"
42,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Blueberry Bliss FTW!,"I have used Curls products (Creme Brule) for over a decade. I recently transitioned to CGM (Curly Girl Method), and I kept seeing ladies recommending the Blueberry Bliss gel. I had to give it a try and this product does not disappoint. I found with BB, that if you do mousse, gel, mousse, I am able to get a really great cast. This has become my go-to gel and I am having fun stacking it with other products to figure out the best combo."
43,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Staple product,Great texture to the gel. Never sticky. Doesn't leave any white residue. Perfect hold without the helmet hard feeling. We wash hair once or twice a week. I use this daily in my kids hair. Next day you can't even tell I used gel. Hair remains soft the next day. No flakes at all.
44,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Has Aloe,"What it doesn't show in the second photo listing ingredients is that it has Aloe in it. I know there is only a small group of people who are allergic to this, but you need to include a full ingredient listing!"
45,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best curl gel ever, for me anyway","I’ve been through so many curl gels, it’s not even funny, but this one works for me and my 2b/c curls. Doesn’t contain water insoluble ‘cones, doesn’t make my hair crunchy, washes out easily. I’ll continue to use this, until it’s probably discontinued, that’s just my luck!"
46,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Poorly made product,"I bought this product for my 15 month old hair. She is a quarter white and a quarter black. This product did nothing for her hair, all I can say is that it smells good. It’s way expensive for the edge control gel and curl control. I wouldn’t recommend this product. I saw people using this on their babies hair on YouTube and thought I would try it on my daughters. It also leaves a white residue in her hair as well. I’ve heard of better products than this one."
47,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Drying,"I was so excited to get inside this product. My hair is relaxer free., the texture is soft and tend to shrink although very curly with a 4B pattern. unfortunately this product definitely dried out my hair. I tried it three times even added other products to try and make it drying. When first applied it slicks down nicely until it dries and becomes dull."
48,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype,"Not sure what the hype is about for this product. It smells like medicine, not blueberries and it didn't define my curls at all. I know different products react different to hair types so I'm not faulting that, really it's the smell and the cost. Amazon for sure had the best deal because in store it's around $17! I got it for $10. Still wasted my money and I can't even give it away."
49,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,It doesn't flake and it smells awesome!,This is now a staple in my hair care routine. I absolutely love it and it smells so darn good! It really helps to define my natural curls and keeps them popping for days. What I love the most about it is the fact that it DOES NOT flake.
50,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"I am disappointed - this product feels drying to my hair, is mildly sticky, and simply doesn't hold the curl for longer than a few hours.  I tried to refresh the curl the next day by misting my curls but had to rewash my hair because it was so sticky."
51,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Product did not work for me,"Product did not work for me. It doesn’t do anything for the frizz, it didn’t hold at all, it did gave me definition on my curls but only for a few not even 3hrs. So advertising that it works the frizz and hold is false. (My experience)"
52,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t smell bad but not my favorite,It works well and doesn’t smell to bad but I have found better products that last longer and make my curls pop more. This one doesnt last in my hair too long and is just meh
53,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Cheaper Products will give you the same result,"The product is ok. Maybe after reading feedbacks i was expecting too much. Mine didnt smell of blueberry or anything like it. I would say it has almost no smell.For its results it kept my hair wavy, but not in a super hold way or anything, just blah."
54,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,I have the most banging hair styles with this product. I love it. It's the exact weight for my hair. My hair is on the fine side and so I need a product that helps give it volume but not to heavy to weigh it down. This product is DA BOMB!
55,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t handle the smell,"This gel worked really well for me, but the smell gave me migraines. If it wasn’t scented, it would be my go-to gel. If you like being able to smell your hair all day, you’ll love this. I could not handle the constant smell, so I ended up giving it away. It doesn’t smell bad, by any means...it’s just way too much. If they even had the same fragrance, but less of it...it would probably be ok."
56,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great scent, great value, and great curls",It’s not particularly moisturizing but it doesn’t leave a cast or crunch in my curls and the scent is out of this world great! I really like the way my hair looks with this product and it’s a great value for high quality product.
57,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Gave me frizz and tangles,So I really wanted to love this gel but it just has too much protein for my hair I think. Whenever I use it I experience more frizz than I get without any products and I get EXTREME hair tangles that take gobs of conditioner to get out. It smells wonderful though. My hair type is 3a medium porosity for the curly girls checking this out.
58,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what my curls needed,"Soft, defined, clumped curls with shine. I'm hooked. Every product isn't right for every curl, but this one definitely works for me. I highly recommend giving it a try."
59,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,I am always searching for a good product for my curly hair,I am always searching for a good product for my curly hair. I heard great things  about this gel so I decided to give it a try.Unfortunately this product did not define my curls. It also left my hair feeling like there was a film on it.
60,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it,I have been using Curls for over 3 years now and I love their products. Especially the Blueberry Bliss line. It helps define your curls and smells amazing. I suggest to purchase along with the Twist-n-Shout cream for maximum curly-ness.
61,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Can't stand the smell,"It's an ok gel, that is gonna depend on each person's hair. Won't buy again bc I CANNOT stand the smell!"
62,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"This product makes my 4C curls hard and I hate the scent. After it’s on my hair a few days, my hair starts stinking."
63,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but expensive,"It smells good (in a way that reminds me of middle school) and works good, but not good enough to justify the price. I have ""poofy"" and curly hair, and it does keep it in good shape as long as I use a moisturizer."
64,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Works pretty good.,"Pros and Cons.  The consistency is kind of bloppy.  It's not smooth like it looks in the bottle.  It works pretty good, but takes a lot of product.  Melts into hair easily and doesn't leave hair crunchy.  Probably a good product for those who are looking for a light gel.  Very sweet smelling.  Not my holy grail, but I'll keep it in my arsenal."
65,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Money value?,"I love the scent of this product and I think it works well for most curly haired girls. However, it is just too expensive. It doesn’t last long and it’s a pretty small bottle for the price. Too bad..."
66,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Softness and shine,It didn't provide the results I need most. I felt that my hair was more dry not less dry.  It did not provide a healthy shine to my hair. My experience will not be the same for everyone. This might be a very individual experience.
67,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,I really wanted to love it,"I love that this hair gel has natural ingredients in it, and I love the smell, but I didn't love the results. I have a lot of very fine curly hair. Yesterday was a rainy day and my hair frizzed all over. I'd put enough gel in my hair that I couldn't run my fingers through it to calm it down. Like I said, I really wanted to love, just couldn't."
68,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,not for me,"it made my hair crunchy.  I have fine hair and its a weird cross between 2b,2c,and 3a curls. I'm trying to achieve no frizz but still soft.  The search continues."
69,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but weighs my hair down,I love this gel but it does take the volume out of my 3C hair. My hair is fine so it looks better with just the blueberry bliss leave in conditioner as a styling product with no gel
70,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture?,"This product only moisturizes the hair when it is first applied.  Once the products dries, the hair becomes dry.  Not sure why this particular fragrance was selected."
71,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my hair type,"I’m a 2C/3A curl and this product did not do it for me. I tried it alone and with other products, diffused and air dried and no matter what my hair came out dry and sticky. It smells wonderful and I wanted to love it, but sadly this goes to the product graveyard for me."
72,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,"PRODUCT SMELLS AMAZING, MY CURLS LOVE","Found this product through #CurlyGirlMethod online, and the smell is as good as people said, the product works like Magic in my hair & on my curls, and the price point is reasonable!!!

74,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Just OK,"I have 2c/3a curly hair and this just didn't have the hold I was looking for. Love the smell and the fact that it didn't harden into tackiness, but just not strong enough for me."

76,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,I used this product one time after shampooing and conditioning ...,"I used this product one time after shampooing and conditioning my hair. It did everything it claimed, the only downside. I had to use 1/3 of the product and it cost 25.00. Very expensive. Although I have seen it in Target for 19.00. I will keep using this product but sparingly."

This product truly makes my curls feel some major TLC! I was a little taken aback by the smell at first. It smells more of hard alcohol to me than blueberry.

81,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Too heavy for fine curls,"This is a gel as to be expected. However, i wasn’t expecting it to weigh my hair down so much. So many curly girls rave about this product and unfortunately with fine curl, this product is much too heavy."
82,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls natural hair beautifully,No more searching all over for this product. It's often hard to find and nothing else curls my natural hair like it. I love it!

84,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I could give this zero stars.,"This product did not work in my curly hair at all and it made my normally soft, thick, curly hair feel like straw?! I somehow missed the return window and can't get my money back, which is really upsetting because this was way more expensive than the Cantu products that I normally purchase (which work way better in my curls). Won't be purchasing any further products from this company. What a disappointment!"

89,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Pass.,Not worth the price. Didn’t do anything more than a normal drugstore leave in conditioner. Would return if I didn’t open it.

94,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for 4c hair,"Wouldn't recommend,  didn't work for 4c hair"
95,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a long way.,I love this stuff. You only need to use very little (of course that will vary depending on how dense your hair is). No sticky feeling once dry. Defines each curl. I wasnt too pleased with the fragrance but once dry you cant smell it.
96,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great results for curly hair, best when used with hair creme.","I have had tried many hair products for my curly hair and this one is one of my favorites!

97,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful bouncy curls,This gel works great for my wash n gos. My hair is 3c/4a and I only use this on the 4a sections (it's too heavy for the 3c sections). It makes my curls bouncy and defined.

103,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Curls Curls,I was not sure if I was going to like this product. I was curious after seeing founder on the OWN network. I like the way it makes my hair feel and it brings out those curls. I wish it came in travel size

123,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,It was ok,I was prepared for the smell but it has this stick and not a slip when I put it on my daughters curls. I tried to use it on mine but I had to add other product for it to work well.

178,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it's supposed to and smells great,I usually use this gel after my shea moisture curl smoothie product and its leaves a nice hold and makes my hair smell amazing. I also reapply on day 2 hair after usual products
179,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive and lacking,"I had so much hope for this product! Unfortunately, it does not have enough hydrating agents to keep the moisture in the curls, lacks the ability to hold curls in place, and is actually quite drying, causing curls to frizz after a few hours.My hair is thick, color treated, but never tortured with heat, and it has the tendency to frizz when improperly hydrated (I'm told I'm 3A). I can usually wash, apply product, and go. Not so with this product, and rewetting and adding more product did not help the situation. I would not recommend this product to anyone with curls to tame."

A bit expensive, though...","Bought this product after seeing some good reviews by other curly naturalistas online. Curls Blueberry Bliss Control Jelly smells like summer in a bottle! It gives my 3c/4a hair good hold and shine while not leaving my hair hard or crunchy when dry (probably due in part to the castor oil).  When I want more definition and shine, I use it with a little Ecostyler Argan Oil styling gel (alcohol free, great shine, plus UV protection). Just wish Curls offered it in a larger sized container...since my hair is so thick, I'm going through the 8 oz. bottle pretty quickly.  It's a bit expensive, but I might purchase it again."

My only complaint is the price! I can't understand why it's so expensive. And I haven't been able to find it in any ground stores. They've made it too exclusive, hard to find and expensive, which is a turnoff. I'll probably buy it again, but use it sparingly to delay the purchase as long as possible! Lol...."

329,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,I did like the smell of the blueberry,"I did like the smell of the blueberry, but overall this product left my hair a little sticky and a little drying.  My curls started their day out looking great and by the end of the day I experienced dry shrinkage.  Trying to give it a shot, I spritzed my curls with some water, placed a conditioner cap on & covered it with a Satin bonnet.  Next morning when trying to rearrange the curls my hair felt a bit sticky.  I hate to say it, but I tossed it in the trash can."
330,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"Does exactly what it says. Just don't mix with other brands, from my experience."

336,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! Worth the $$,"Love this stuff. It has the hold of a gel but doesn't make your hair feel gross as a typical gel. Also, the smell is great! I have 3a/b hair if that helps."
337,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,"Great, smells good"
338,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Two Stars,Not what I expected
339,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,Product did not do what it claims
340,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),3.0 out of 5 stars,Strong Smoke or Cigarette smell,"When this stuff dries it smells smoky like cigarette butts. Not like fire though, its straight up not good smelling. Its really strong too I don't understand why people think this smells good. I know I'm not the only person that has smelled it because there is another review on here where the person mentions the smoky smell and I was trying to google if other people smelled it and found that a person wrote a review on Target's site mentioning the smoky odor.  I wonder if this is a genetic thing, like how people with certain genes think some spices taste like soap.Other than the smell the product works well, it is sticky though."
341,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but needs a bit of help,"I'm sure if you are looking to purchase this product, you are used to the curly girl method or at least you are like most of us, one product does not do it all, and you use several products to get your curls the way you like.  I really like this Jelly, but it does need a leave-in under it and an oil or serum on top or mixed in.  (Curls have some nice Blueberry or the Cashmere line is great too).  The hold is mild and the curl encouragement is quite good.I have 3a-3b Caucasian curls with a bit of wave (2a maybe, not curly at all) in the crown and I found with a leave-in first and just this Jelly, my hair was a bit dry and frizzy on the ends and my layered length.  I definitely need something more to tame my mild frizzes.  The smell is great as I am so over anything coconut smelling I hope to never have to use a coconut (scented) product ever again in my lifetime.  If you are used to DevaCurl or Ouidad, you most likely will not like this product as it is not wet at all, and more of a traditional gel consistency, but the good of that is it does not take 1/2 a day to air -dry my  thick hair."
342,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible, drying product. Left my hair frizzy, with no curl definition.","Worst curl product I have bought in years.  I have never had a gel or curl product leave my hair this dry and frizzy.  I have used it as I would any curl cream or defining gel product (in soaking wet hair, scrunched, did not rub with a towel, etc.).  I don't know what others are using but this did not work for my 3a curls.  It felt sticky, but after my hair dried naturally, it turned to frizz. I bought this from a major retailer, not through Amazon, and I would never buy it again.  I just threw my 90% full bottle in the trash after about five attempts to use it."
343,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,One of my staple products!,"This is definitely one of my staple products! It defines my hair well enough will little crunchiness (gel cast) and it smells wonderful! After wetting my hair with water and applying a moisturizing cream, I smooth this over my hair to define my curls (I don't scrunch because I don't need to and it'll make my hair shrink even more) and apply a small amount of the Aunt Jackie's Don't Shrink defining gel on top while my hair is still wet. It gives me amazing results that I haven't found with any other product! A little bit goes a long way and I've had one bottle since December (it lasted me about 6-7 months at the time that I'm posting this review). I highly recommend this for those who have between a 3b and 4a hair texture that is also low porosity.The only downside about it is that it can be upwards of $17 in some stores, but I'm glad it's a bit cheaper online."
344,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Honest review from a kinky girl,I have turly kinky hair that doesn’t really clump much without a gel. So I have tried many different products. I used this product on clean hair (no product build up) with the matching leave in. So I can honestly say this THIS JUST ALEO VERA GEL with a few unneeded ingredients that don’t make many any styling difference. I had definition when I first applied the product but buy the end of the day my hair was a dry frizzy mess. On top of that I ended up with beads of dried leave in in my hair because the products don’t mix. This may work for someone who doesn’t have tight kinky hair. If you like the results just pick some Aloe Vera gel from Trader Joe’s or a similar store. It’s like $4.00.If you have kinky hair stick to Uncle Funky’s Curl Magic or home made flex seed gel.The vitamins from this company are great but this blueberry stuff is just a gimmick. You can buy aloe gel from anywhere much cheaper.
345,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,Too heavy for my hair,"I wanted to like this jelly, but it weighs down my low porosity 2c/3a curls. Gave me no definition and just made my hair stringy. It also leaves NO cast- this is a jelly, not a gel. Would probably work well for thicker hair types that are looking for moisture. But if you’re looking for something lighter that still gives you hold, don’t buy this."
346,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,save your money.,"I was very excited to use these products and once I did I was very disappointed. There is a website called EWG Skin deep which allows you to see if the ingredients used in hair or skin care products are clean. I typed in curls and the blueberry bliss collection immediately popped up and I clicked it only to find out that these products are insanely dirty????? what's up with that? I didn't want to believe it so I used the products anyway. MY OH MY I WAS PISSED OFF. MY HAIR STARTED TO FALL OUT, MY HAIR STARTED TO FEEL DRY, AND ALL AROUND THE EDGES OF MY HAIR WAS RED. Now it's up to you if you would still like to use this ""hair care"" line. My experience may be different from yours."
347,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Twist Out !!!,"I have 3c hair and I purchased this product at the Natural Hair Show in Atlanta back in April 2016 along with some other products. I. I finally got around to using this product.  It was amazing.  I received so many compliments.  My twist out was very defined, moisturized and had absolutely no frizz.  Great Product. The only con is it cost $25.00 on most web sites.... I am elated to find it here for much cheaper than $25.00.  This is now one of my favorite products for twist outs."
348,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,5 stars for the price,"At my local organic food store, this is 11 dollars, and for that price, it's a 5-star product. If it goes up to 16, I will revert to other products that I like there, often on sale.  It's good for fine hair.  Same re their Créme Brule, for the price."
349,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff,"I've tried everything out there for curly hair! Most don't work at all, I was hesitant to try this product because I thought I was for thicker type 4a/b/c hair, I personally have very long thin type 3b hair still very curly but I can not use products that weight my hair down. And most of the type 4 hair products weight mine down, anyway this product is great defined my hair like no other product the only DOWNFALL is it does not have much hold if you touch your hair a lot you will definitely need to add a little gel or mossue for hold. But I definitely recommend this product it's a little expensive for me because I use a lot I have very long hair down to my lower back so I may need a cheaper alternative"
350,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,The best product I have ever used!!!,"The Curls Blueberry Bliss Control Jelly is my favorite finishing product when I am doing my curly girl look. It pairs well with the Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave In Conditioner and the Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste. The control jelly helps my curls stay in tack also with a shine that last all day. I have tight spiral curls and until I discovered this product I had a hard time finding something that would reduce the frizz, hold my curls, provide a shine and does not flake up. I use this for my protective curly girl style and for my twist out. I also love how it is organic and it smells so good. You will not be disappointed in this purchase. This has been such a life saver on many occasions."
351,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works Great, No Crunch","I love this product! It smells good and doesn't leave my hair crunchy like other products. I use the blueberry bliss leave-in conditioner, hair mask and edge control as well. When I do my wash and go I use the gel and a little almond oil and my hair comes out great consistently. Definitely worth the extra cost."
352,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),2.0 out of 5 stars,I think it is not a good fit to my hair,"I didn't buy the baby bliss from Amazon. My hair is in somewhere between wavy and curly, I think it is not a good fit to my hair, it weighs my hair and gives a very sticky texture.  I used it 3-4 times but didn't like it so much, I stopped using it. It smells good though!"
353,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,This jelly is amazing. Several things determined that for me,"This jelly is amazing. Several things determined that for me. (1) It smells SOOO good, like blueberry jolly ranchers. (2) GREAT soft hold that contains my FRIZZY hair [I am so frizz prone, omg]. (3) It's not crunchy at all; my hair looks and feels so soft and healthy. (4) It's love in a bottle...expensive love in a bottle...but great things come at a price [I guess...]. I do wish that Curls would sell this amazing stuff in a bigger size at a more affordable price though. I have 3B-C hair and its absolutely amazing for my hair type! Defined moisturized curls that bounce and sway with every step. Not many gels give you that."
354,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and shines bright,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Control Jelly is one of my favorite products! I love how it does not have No silicones, sulfates or parabens as I am really sensitive to stuff like that. I love how it shines my curls as I have a different kind of hair texture so it’s difficult for me to get that shine but this jelly makes my hair shine bright. It also smells so good that I want to eat it haha. I totally recommend this product it’s a great gem to have it !"
355,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible smell,"Left my curly hair so dry and sticky, and didn't even define or hold. I Couldn’t wait to wash it out."
356,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Curls,Curls products are amazing. As a girl with 4c hair it has been very difficult finding products that really work.

357,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Yyyaaaassss!,"I'll admit, I wasn't a fan at first. But, I decided to try this product again and I love it! My curls were very defined with no frizz. Best of all, my hair wasn't crunchy. It works well with my other products so I didn't get the dreaded white residue. It smells great and it has great slip. I think once you figure out how to use it (little or a lot of water in your hair) you'll get great results. I'm a fan!"

381,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),5.0 out of 5 stars,Forma sin maltrato,"El producto  pareciera ser un gel. Pero realmente al aplicarlo no tienes cabello rígido.  Por el contrario  un aspecto sedoso y mis rizos definidos.  Me ha encantado. Lo único: es algo costoso para la cantidad que tiene. Usualmente uso 3 productos. Aceite de argan, crema de peinar  de Gardner y finalizo con un gel ligero.  Esto es justo lo que buscaba."
382,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),4.0 out of 5 stars,"The bottle is riDICKulous. Otherwise, 5 stars","It's a *great* product, but it is malpractice by Curls tm that it comes in a bottle you have to shake down hard and then squeeze hard and repeatedly when it should come in a tub that you can scoop out, because it's that thick.The plastic bottle is nearly unusable.  I probably need to buy my own small tub to transfer it into but this stuff is not cheap, and I shouldn't have to work this hard or spend extra money to use it even if it is good."

This makes your braids and twist look new and fresh. It does not frizz and smells really good. Its a bit pricey but worth it. It keeps your hair looking refreshed.

404,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Ridiculously expensive. Product came out extremely sticky - almost like a glue consistency (unsure if my product was faulty or not) . Smells amazing but worst hair product to date. I have 4a hair and I would recommend any Shea moisture or Cantu product instead. Don’t waste your money
405,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I have just started to follow the Curly Girl Method and this gel is just perfect. It holds my curls and with just a tiny amount I get my curls back on track (2c/3a) and smells so good.Don't use too much if you want soft curls.It contains protein so I usually alternate it with another gel that doesn't contain protein to maintain a good balance on my hair.

424,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I am not sure if its supposed to smell like vodka and mild scent of lemon. I ordered for the gel and Smell as most reviews ppinted out. There is no user friendly method to get in contact with the seller . So here i am, leaving a review. The gel is not strong enough.  But leaves significantly less residue compared to other gels in this price range. If someone can reach out and try describing what this smells like, it would help confirming i got a defective piece."
425,Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly (8 Ounce),Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I wish this scent was in a perfume because it is so good. I have 2C hair I think it’s called, like a medium wave in my hair. I used this product, scrunched, and let my hair air dry it looked good but I don’t think it worked any miracles more than a normal gel would."

It did wonders for my curls - I have very fine hair, and it didn’t weigh them down.

0,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Paste! 😍,"For starters, I'm glad it's called Curl Control Paste instead of Pomade. I had this in my wishlist for a couple of Years while purchasing other pomades but this one. Lo and behold, the Best has been sitting in my wishlist aaallll this time! For some reason I thought it may be too light, not do the job etc., but while other pomades may work, they left my hair with a white film, or too hard, not enough hold, gummy, waxy, cake-y or just didn't smooth my hairline from the start. I  was  so  frustrated with pomades!The makers of this Knows curly hair and I got to thinking this may work for me. For reference, I have a mix of different hair types, wavy, curly, coily 3c-ish (if your into the hair typing) at my hairline. So I purchase this for my hairline, edges, or so-called baby hairs. It is PERFECT, just what I needed! I applied this immediately to dry hair when I received it, used a brush and BAM! My hair laid down like nobody's business. I really could not believe it, and it was with such little effort, it was like magic, like poof - done. Oh, and get this: It STAYED. I know it's not summer here, but other pomades I used were getting tacky in the fall soooo.... After a while, it leaves a matte finish and looks as if you've applied nothing to your hair, just smooth it down with a brush. The next morning: perfect, and do not sleep with a scarf, just a silk pillowcase. I did not need to use a scarf after applying this either, not that I ever did with the others. But you could if you need too and it will make it more effective. It is the Perfect Paste, but did not make my hair Paste-y.4/3/18 UPDATE: In January I ended up using Creme of Nature's Snot....I know, I know, BUT Curls Paste contains Glycerin (4th ingredient) and when dew point levels drop in winter, I find I can't use a lot of glycerin. So, I started using the Snot only for my edges. Not only is it spring, but it ACTUALLY feels like spring, I have used this Curls Paste a couple of times and it works as before!Don't forget sometimes you have to switch those products according to the seasons😉"
1,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,BLUBERRY DREAM,"I love this product! It does exactly what it says, the smell is wonderful and the hold is exceptional. I will definitely continue to use this product on my hair!"
2,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Only Product to Hold my Edges!,"I have the type of hair that will not lay down... until I tried this product. I think this is the only thing that can hold my edges. As soon as I apply it, my edges lay unlike other gels that makes my edges curl up. It's not a wet product so it won't revert your hair."
3,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works for type 2b hair,"I have short, wavy type 2b hair and wanted something to define and enhance my natural curls. This does the job, only— a little amount goes a long way for me, and I have to make sure my hair is well conditioned and moisturized beforehand, or else the product kind of just sits on top of my dry hair and feels sticky. I would recommend using a leave-in conditioner first if your hair is very dry like mine. I used to use the ‘devacurl: beautiful mess’ pomade with positive results and this is an adequate dupe for me, being a fraction of the price. The smell is not my fav: kind of smells like a blue raspberry jolly rancher and I prefer more subtle smells or no smell at all. But, oh well!"
4,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG Buy this,Where have I been this stuff is super awesome. My 4C hair is finally looking good.  I bow down to this product. I have used on dry end of the week hair and BAM looking good the next day and the day after.  Nothing has every done  this for my hair I am in love!
5,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky,"Sticky, somewhat unpleasant texture; if your hands are wet it's nearly impossible to scoop onto your hands.  Don't use on wet hair (to do a twist out), it won't work at all.  Hair needs to be fully dry. Smells really good, like blueberries.  My sister loves to use it for edge control and is a repeat buyer."
6,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells Great, Works Not so Great","The Curls Blueberry smells delicious but did nothing to ""lay down"" the edges. I have afro-textured, 4b/4c, almost 4z hair, for reference. My hair laughed at this product. If you want to smell of and/or crave blueberry pie feel free to purchase this product."
7,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy Grail for Edge Control,"Where has this product been all my life?! This control paste smells great and is not sticky; nor does it leave any kind of residue in my hair. I use to smooth my front edges of my transitioning hair and this gets the job done without looking too ""laid"" This is definitely an everyday go to in my hair styling routine."
8,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh...,"Smell is nice, easy to apply, and laid my edges down nicely at first. But it did not hold. I have natural hair and my edges curled back up. It also leaves white flakes behind in the hair."

10,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pros and cons,Pros:- With consistent use can bring some growth & improvement to your hairline- Does good with fly aways with cornrows and braids- Makes your parts look very cleanCons:- Does not hold short hair in place
11,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,i absolutely love this.,"i absolutely love this....BIG TIP: do not use a lot!! just a very small amount on the TIPS of your curls only...to give them some shape and personality... because it can get very dry, thick, and sticky if you use a lot... it's like a pomade, it's not meant to be globbed on...use a very small amount only on the tips and watch your curls transform.. i pair this with all of my curling creams"
12,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Stuff!,"I love this stuff! It makes my hair very shiny and really defines my curl pattern! I find that it works best when my hair is dry and I just spritz it with a little water. This is a great substitute for gel! It also smells really good, so it's pleasant to work with."
13,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Nice AND Works...woohoo!,Works great to lay your edges if they are damp but doesn’t seem to work for me if my hair is dry.  I have also had great luck using a natural brush and all is good... nice and smooth.I prefer this scent over the other one they have but both smell good.
14,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have,"This is one of my new favorites. It gives excellent edge control for my toddler natural hair. It’s light and smells amazing. A little bit goes a long way. Helps with frizz, fly aways just a good product. Definitely will try their other items."
15,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great edge control!,I love this! Works perfect for my locs. My hair is a soft texture and the first thing to mess up is my edges! But this product holds them together the longest.
16,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for little girls edges!!,I love this edge control for my 2 year old 4b/c daughters hair. It works miracles on her edges pretty much keeping her hair looking neat all day!!! Smells great but what a tiny jar!!!
17,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"Good product but ingredient in it took off my nail polish as I was doing my hair so I stopped using it. Nonetheless, it does what it was suppose to do to my hair n I didn’t get any flaking"
18,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this for my natural hair edges,"I love my edges natural, but sometimes I want the slick look. I also do not want them to break off, flake or look old so I was very careful to find an edge control that not only did the job but still added some soft shine. This is the only edge control I use and the smell just adds even more reason to use!"
19,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommended  Product,"I like this product because it is not greasy, gives a good shine. I am satisfied with this product. I received this product in a very short time. It is good to be a Prime member."
20,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells good, works good...until mold started growing on it!!!","The product works well and smells fantastic. I was pretty grossed out however when I went to use it on my daughter's edges and noticed that a white, fuzzy mold started growing on the paste. It is less than 9 months old and i don't know what ingredients are in it that would allow mold to produce. Needless to say I had to throw the remaining half of the jar away. What a waste!Do not buy this product unless you plan on using the entire jar in less than 6 months"
21,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Gel is as Expected, BUT Shipping was a Fail","This gel smells good and is moisturizing. Provides a soft hold for my silver edges, which is what I expected. Minused a star ⭐️ due to shipping from Vendor Infinite Beauty. My gel arrived later than estimated, BUT the real issue was that it arrived with the top to the jar completely off and some of the gel spilled in the shipping bag....not good."
22,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,Item is so small.  It more of a sample size than a 4ounce product.  It more like a wax than a paste when place on edges.  It has a strong weird blueberry scent.

63,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like this product,"I really like this product.  I read a review that someone tried to use it as an edge control; I don't think that is the intent - it says it can be used for edge contol on the instructions, they should remove that because if you have curly hair it will absolutely simulate the curl not straighten them.  For edge control I love Olive Oil edge control  (fabulous,  but rinse/wet wipe it out daily... it is tacky and leaves wierd residue when old).  This blueberry curl paste  is great to use on wet hair ends - it does a beautiful job providing a smooth end to your curls.  Best used as the last product to seal the cuticle  (remember, wet is best, and let it air dry)."
64,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,would recommend it!,"Works for what I wanted it for......just to use for control and fly away hair when I wear it in a ponytail or pinned up or for shine, etc.,.....would recommend it!!"

To my surprise that didn't work either! Totally not worth my money...and I tried to make it work 3 separate occasions!!! But one thing it did live up to was that it smelled good and did not leave residue! If you ever brought jam or used jam....that's all this is! #ALLhype"

Everyone praises it so much, that I felt like I just had to try it. I have natural hair and it did not hold WHATSOEVER. My hair curled right back up. I had to add another edge control ON TOP of gel to it just so it could lay my edges down. They still ended up curling back up by the end of the day. The only positive is it does smell good. But it is NOT worth $17 at all. I would return it if I could. I have tried edge controls/gels that were a fraction of that price that gave excellent results. Will not be buying again!! Disappointed!"

161,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great with some flaws,It lays down great if you’re not using it in the summer ! I live in Las Vegas and it’s been in the 80-90s and this last about 30 min in the dang on house and my hair right back curly smh . Winter months it works but I will say using everyday it does build up eventually and turns a greyish white and looks sticky. I wish the hold was better for the summer but nope these edges won’t hold and I have 4C hair. Now my daughter has very curly thin hair not sure what texture you would call it but she’s mixed and it works great for her in the heat.
162,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,No Build-up!!,"I recommend this product. My edges are very resistant. This lays them down but the hold doesn’t last all day. Also, it has a very glossy shiny finish which I don’t prefer. Where this item excels is there is no build up and it doesn’t dry your hair out. Other similar items tend to turn white after a few uses and/or make your hair crunchy. Not this product. I would recommend it. For reference I am about 4B-C."
163,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,"I needed something to hold and define my curls so I decided to try this, and It did exactly what I needed. I used it for a two strand twist out and in the morning, my hair looked great. I had great definition with no frizz and amazing shine. The paste left my hair feeling light with no white residue or crunch. This is the second product I've tried from this brand (the first was the Creme Brulee) and I have not been disappointed. I don't think the hold is strong enough to use as an edge control, but for a styling paste it works great. For reference purposes, I believe my hair is 4A/B and it can get really dry."
164,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,At first I did not like this product,"At first I did not like this product. Because the hold strength wasn't strong enough. But then I used this product in a different way, with a new hairstyle on my daughter's hair with a different texture. It worked like a charm! Great Shine and hold--when dried all the way.  Loved the smell at first But, now it reminds me of a strong wine scent......can be overwhelming the longer or amount used! I would buy this again. For Braids, cornrows, twist-outs, etc"

I like this product as a regular gel/paste but it doesn't really lay my edges down like I'd like it to and that was the main reason I bought it for. I bought the Curls Passion Fruit Control Paste two years ago and I LOVED that one, now that was great at keeping the edges at bay. I don't think I'll be buying this product again but instead the Passion Fruit Paste, or the Creme of Nature Argan Oil edge control."
167,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for 3B Curly Hair/ Edges,"My favorite hair gel! Perfect for quick bun or pony tail styles, applying this on wet hair with dry hands defines the curls. I use only on edge area or top of hair, and doesn’t dry too sticky or hard. It’s nice if you don’t want to wear a headband but look more put together. Highly recommend ! (I have 3B/3C hair). Doesn’t work as good as Got2Be for edges but does define curls."
168,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best edge control,"This is the only edge control that keep my edges laid. I use this product to slick does my edges when my hair is in a protective style, ponytail, or bun."

181,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells just like Candy,"I'm going to be honest,  I only gave this a 4/5 because of the smell alone, it smells exactly like a blueberry jolly rancher.  I purchased my 4 fl oz at target , it did not control, smooth nor slick my unruly edges, the hold was very light and not ever lasting. But its a perfect way to add perfume or fragrance to a bad hair day."
182,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Red and Blue dyes added!!!,Red dye and blue dye in the ingredients!!! And this is 'organic' those are unnecessary toxins. Thus I didn't buy it. Don't be fooled by the organic claims
183,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Buy! !,"I'd first like to point out that this product is a POMADE, NOT a gel. That being said, this is WONDERFUL! I have curly hair. I used just enough to cover the tip of a toothbrush and combed from my edges towards the back in sections. It laid down smoothly, it was shiny, && it wasn't sticky. It was super light feeling && even though my edges were slicked down, it wasn't hard. My hair was smooth && smelled great. It's like a blueberry candy. With using just a little, it held for 7 hrs (with sweating a little). I haven't used this for actual styling but I'm looking forward to it since it feels so nice. Great for a natural look. The only negative is the packaging. It arrived safely and quickly, but the jar itself was wrapped in saran wrap. There was no actual seal."
184,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for 4c hair,Good for 4c hair. I gave it 4 stars due to the off white residue after a few days of repeat apply. I shampoo my hair weekly and wrap it nightly with a scarf. It makes a difference to wrap it so you won't have to constantly apply if you have coarse hair.
185,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,I love this paste so much. It controls frizz and maintains softness. So it doesn't feel as crispy as other gels would cause. It smells great. Provides great sheen and I just wish I knew about this product all a long.I have 4b 4c mixed hair.

227,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the scent I expected,"Tried this for the first time at my salon. The blueberry smell was just wonderful! But sadly this one has not the same pleasant blueberry scent, this one has a bit of a chemical smell, it fades after a few mins. It does smooth nicely my edges for a few hours, which is was intended for(3B-3C-4A hair). I give it a 3 star just because I bought it for the scent. This is best for 3B-3C hair."

229,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Blueberry Paste❤️,Excellent product❤️. I use it to control the frizz I sometimes get when humidity occurs.
230,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Won't be buying again.,"I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or what, but this does not help me to slick down my edges. My hair is still frizzy and won't lay flat. And sometimes it goes on so heavy, it doesn't spread through my hair the way I need it to."

234,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good outweights the not so good,"Product looked like it was great to lay down edges, but alas the hold doesn't last long.HOWEVER, despite the lack of full edge control, the product has enough other benefits that I keep it handy to touch up my wash and go during the week.1. It's NOT greasy or oily. It's hard to find a water-based pomade for ethnic hair.2. This product is magic on frizz and fly-aways without changing the texture of the hair. In the past trying to rehab frizzy pieces with twists or braids inevitably changed the texture vs the rest of my wash and go and those pieces of hair would stick out in a weird way. But this product smooths frizz and allows the hair to spring back to its original shape without a total re-wet.3. The scent is very light and pleasant and doesn't linger too long.4. While it won't hold the edges long, it's very moisturizing and soothing on brittle edges."
235,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great definition but capable of removing nail polish!!,"This is not the perfect product but it gives my 3A curls some of the best definition and hold out of any products I've tried so I keep using it. I like that it's not crunchy and doesn't leave any sort of residue in my hair! I've been using it for years off and on and will combine it with a styling cream because I can use a little less of it that way. The jars are very small but I don't find that I have to use a ton of product on my armpit length hair, unlike with others so it doesn't go unreasonably fast, but it would definitely be nice to have a larger jar or slightly lower price.I touch my hair a lot and don't really like the way this product feels on my hands. It definitely leaves a little greasy feel if I touch it too much. Also, this product actually ate the nail polish off my fingers!! On multiple occasions! I worry about what it does to my hair if it's capable of removing nail polish and feel kinda crazy for continuing to use it but the definition and hold is so good! I'm about to try the passion fruit one for the first time to see if it's any different."

243,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!!,Tried a few edge controls they didn't really work for me but this one is amazing! Really slicked down my edges. A little definitely goes a long way. No hard or crunchy. Easy to wash out. Will be trying on a twist out soon!
244,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Edge Control,"This lays my girls hair down very well. Ponytails, edges, braid smoother, you name it. No more Cantu for me."
245,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"This is a very good edge control gel for curly girls.All of the other ones I've tried have been from brands either currently targeting relaxed hair or previously have done so and only changed the cover of their product. This one actually feels like it is soft enough for curly edges. My edges are very easily ripped out and the results with this are a lot softer. Granted, it doesn't have the strongest hold ever and it never feels stiff, but it holds well enough. I only would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a strong hold that doesn't move whatsoever for some sort of updo, for a more natural look and feel, I'd go for this.It also smells amazing and I was worried I wouldn't like the smell, but it's really great."
246,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I don't know why other people have said this doesn't hold well. But this laid my hair down all day in a low bun. From 7am - 9pm and my hair didn't get frizzy at all. I have tried other products and my hair would be frizzy by midday. I have low porosity, thick, medium density, 4b hair.The jar is TINY for the price, making it a little on the expensive side. The smell is amazing and lasts for 4+ hours."
247,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Love this product! This is my third purchase. I use this to slick down my 4c hair into a low bun. Smells so good and really brings out curls. I also wanna say its helped make my hair thicker and stronger.

264,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Paste, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Works magic. It holds down my edges for about half of the day, which is normal because it usually comes out after an hour or two with other products. The smell is amazing and it does not leave any debris. I only wash my hair once every 5 days to a week so it’s perfect to use without leaving white dirt on my edges.I used to use the product “edges” and I still love it for the same reasons as this product but I will say that I found this one dries up slower and gives an amazing after scent!!(I have 3C hair)"

Took cap off product to find the aluminum seal had been previously opened. Cannot use this as I am afraid to ingest."
3,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Growth and Healthier Hair my 14 month transformation,"this is a product that has really my hair back to life, thick, full and healthy. My hair has been growing faster than ever, it helps my skin and nails as well. I lOVE IT !!!! serving per day is reasonable. You will see the result in 2 to 3 wks."
4,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Positive effects so far,"I want to start by saying that I am a complete skeptic when it comes to online review so you can absolutely trust that this is my sincere experience. I wish I had gotten to try the original formula since some reviews are saying it is not the original formula but the current formulation has done some very good things so far. I have been having issues with my nails for the past year and in two weeks of taking this (not consistently and the minimal amount 1 tbsp) my nails are growing like weeds, are firm, and back to their old selves. As far as my hair I've noticed that my dry scalp has pretty much disappeared with no change in my hair care routine. My hair growth/thickness has never been an issue so I can't really say if it has had any effect so far in that area and no change in my skin as of yet. Liquid vitamins are better than pill form and that's why I ordered it, the taste is similar to Lipton Brisk ice tea in my opinion. The price is a bit much for such a small amount but my nails coming back to life is enough for me to disregard the price tag."
5,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Blueberry in a bottle,"So far so good for this supplement. The blueberry scent is strong. Reminds me of an apple cider vinegar, but blueberry flavored. I seem to have less hair loss after showering."
6,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Hair Vitamin I’ve EVER Tried,"AMAZING PRODUCT! I’ve tried so many Hair, Skin, and Nails vitamins and never felt that I’ve seen a difference. But even though this is only my first bottle, I have so much less breakage/shedding. Before I would have a fist-sized ball of hair from detangling, but now it’s little to none. I definitely don’t mind the taste. Love this product and would buy again."
7,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pleased Until I Experienced Breakouts,"I enjoyed the taste of this supplement. I even looked forward to drinking it every night. It is a pricey vitamin at around $50 per month. I took it for three weeks. I had to stop because at week three it started breaking my face out in slightly irritating acne. I do have acne prone skin and have used an acne face wash for many years, but the breakouts still came. I hate that it broke me out as I wanted to continue this product. My hair is softer, some longer and thicker. I am not sure if it’s because of this supplement, or the hair oils, deep conditioning, and scalp messages I am also doing; or a combination of all of it. If I hadn’t experienced breakouts I would still be using this."
8,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hair, skin and nails magic!","I was skeptical I would see a difference, I thought if anything I would be a lattice healthier for having taken vitamins.My hair is color damaged and grows extremely slow. I can already see it’s softer but I swear I’m having to color my roots way sooner. My nails feel stronger and aren’t peeling like they used too. My skin feels softer and I haven’t had to use moisturizer as much any more."
9,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I loved it so much that I bought 2 more! I can tell a difference in my hair thickness and length!
10,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Expired and gross!,This product was disgustingly gross for smell and taste and they took off the expiration date so I wouldn’t see that it was expired and that’s probably why it was like that. I believe it was way older and they did give a refund on it but come on why would I waste my time and money going through all of that just to return something and Not get what I want!
11,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Strange taste and past exp date!,This does not taste the same as previous bottles I’ve purchased. Just a very strange and unfamiliar taste.  The exp date also says 12/19/2019...that might have something to do with the strange taste. The box was sealed with plastic and the bottle had the inside seal intact under the cap.
12,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Taste is aweful!!!,Have to return. I received it yesterday... Drank it yesterday... This a.m i woke up and my forehead has a bunch of small... Goosebump looking breakout.... This doesn't happen to me ever!!! I guess it's a bad reaction.
13,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,No hair growth,I bought this because someone said they tried it and it helped to grow hair.  Unfortunately that was not my experience. However I  used it all since I bought it. Figured if I didn’t grow hair it might still be good for me with all the vitamins  in it. Won’t buy again.
14,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same product,"I honestly thought I was buying a legit product, but after finishing the bottle I bought from Walgreens and starting this one from Amazon I can tell they are different. Not only the flavor, color and odor is different, but also this made my skin brake up like crazy."
15,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Expired,What i dint like is that I have an expired bottle. This was supposed to be used by 6/2020 thats a whole 9 months that have passed. I don't even want to return it for fear of someone else getting the bottle. I'm just going to discard it. So sad. Will not be purchasing again.
16,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the Investment,"I was very pleased with the quality of the product and how soon I received it.  The flavor and scent were nice.  It's a bit pricey.  However, if the product works, then it will be well worth the investment and I will continue buying 2 bottles every month."
17,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,So gross but works!,"Like any liquid vitamin the taste is disgusting,lol..but I can say it works! I'm not happy with the price since one bottle is only two weeks worth of dosages. But I guess that's the price you pay when getting a quality product"
18,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Vit. B Complex. As well as biotin.,"Taste like vitamins, and it is mild scented. I would need to take it a little longer to get the full effect of how well it makes your hair grow."

25,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Yucky!,I would not recommend. This product had a weird irony taste and I believe it may have been spoiled. It is cheaper and safer to buy directly from the curl’s company.

28,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not convinced,Packaging was as expected. I did one month of this hair growth liquid and I didn’t see a difference in my hair growth so i do t think it’s worth the money.

40,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,seems ok for what it is,"ingredients seem good, taste could be better, not sure what makes it specific to curly hair"
41,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same you would buy in a drugstore,Product expired by a year; brown/yellow color and tastes like vinegar.

Color used to be  very dark now  its light Brown  almost like dirt water  and the taste very different.  Not the same will not buy it anymore
46,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,CONTAINS NUTS!,I purchased this product from the curls website and wouldn't think to look through the ingredients for a vitamin. But come to find out there are various nuts in this product. So I would not recommend buying this if you have a nut allergy. They really should put forth this kind of information along with the description since nut allergies are so common and could end badly if someone doesn't read the ingredients before taking it. Be careful everyone.
47,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Liquid vitamins are the way to go!,"I will be the firs to admit, I am not a pill person. Especially those gigantic hair pills. And gummies are nice, but gummy. So when I found the liquid vitamins I was shocked and impressed. The taste isn't my favorite, but I'm so glad it doesn't taste like medicine. It helped not only my hair grow, but nails too! And I even saw my skin clear up! The only downside I can think of is longer dry time for my hair because there is more of it!"
48,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Improved taste,"This liquid gold works, especially if you have key nutrient deficiency you will see a quick growth. Its only 15 ml a day but it has made a big difference for my energy, hair and skin. I would definitely continue my journey to waist length with you guys."

55,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five star growth vitamin,I’m using my fathers Amazon account to write this but this has helped my skin to glow and my nails to grow. I also saw a difference in the density of my curls I can’t wait to see my results at the end of 2021
56,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best vitamin for hair growth!!!,I absolutely love this product I noticed how thick my hair was just after the first bottle. This vitamin also helps with shedding. The flavor isnt as bad as the previous formula especially if you mix it with juice.
57,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I take them after my first meal of the day, and no worries it tastes great!",I absolutely love this product. Not only are the vitamins helping my hair and nails grow but it’s also making them stronger.

0,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Looooove,"Super love this stuff! I use it to refresh my hair instead of water. Light moisture and just smooths our the grizzlies. Fair warning that it doesn’t must, it just shoots a stream so you can’t just spray it on your hair. You have to squirt it in your hands and apply it. That’s not a deal breaker for me though. I know it’s jusy bc of the viscosity of the product. It’s like an aloe vero consistency."
1,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I absolutely love the stuff!!I was skeptical at first because it’s so expensive but it really works and it’ll last a long time.  The smell is amazing it’s a nice Oily consistency and will fix any Frizzy curl instantly. I love it and will definitely buy again
2,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, bad bottle... Use your own spray bottle.","So good things first, I really like this product. It smells great and does a good job of revitalizing my curls for a 2nd, 3rd, 4th day curl. I use this product to dampen my hair, then move on to mousse.The issue with the product is the spray bottle. It creates a hard stream instead of a bit of a spray/spritz. This means it's hard to get the product all over your head. It took me a while to pinpoint what I didn't like about the product, but then I transferred it to another spray bottle that I could create more of a spritz with and voila! Perfection."
3,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good but that’s it,I use other blueberry bliss products on my children’s hair but this doesn’t do anything. The bottle is used to pump and spray but it’s a straight stream. U have to put it in your hand first. I don’t like that. The product seems to dry their hair out more than moisturize. Returning
4,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty much, we love all things in the Curls ...","Pretty much, we love all things in the Curls blueberry line and I recommend them to everyone. Even my straight haired girl uses this curl fresher + blueberry leave-in to protect her hair while swimming regularly. She picks between the curls leave-in and camille rose caramel sundae leave-in based on which smell she wants - we've found them to work equally well for our curly 4c girl, our 3c girl, and our straighter hair girl - but we always use the curls moisturizers."
5,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Makes hair feel horrible,"Makes your hair just like cotton candy - it smells great but feels sticky and looks frizzy, brittle, and difficult to manage. Whether I’m using it in freshly washed wet hair or just trying to revive 2nd/3rd day hair, it makes everything so much worse. Does not spray out well. You have to spray into your hand, then apply. I tried it over and over again, used 1/10th of the bottle, gave up, and threw it out. Waste of money"
6,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for wavy hair refresh!,"Really great for coarse wavy hair refresh. I spray a little onto my ends in the shower and scrunch on refresh days. I love the whole blueberry curls line, but for my wavy white girl coarse hair (2b-2c), my routine is to use a lathering shampoo and then the deepConditioner each time. I then use a texturizer and blueberry curls gel on soaking wet hair. On refresh days I use just a little of this spray and sometimes some ouai curl cream after my hair has dried. The blueberry bliss  line is amazing for fine, dry, and coarse hair and bringing its texture out."
7,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Sprayer bottle is not good,This product is great.  It brings back the curls between wash days.  It has a very nice scent.  It has a little hold too so go easy so that you don't get a hair spray like stickiness.  Love the product.  But the spray bottle puts out a very focused stream which soaks one spot in your hair.  I spray it into my hands and apply with my fingers.  A very strange choice for the bottle.  I will probably buy again but use one of my own bottles.
8,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Thirsty Curls!,"Does everything it says it will do! Perfect for feeding your thirsty curls on days 2-4 or so on. Part of the Curly Girl Method (no sulfates or silicones). However I’m a little annoyed how it comes out in a stream, so I have to spray it into my hands. This gets kind of messy. Great product otherwise though."
9,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,It works but..,"The product works well and does it’s job, although, the spray applicator is really difficult to get any product out of in the first place. And when you do get it out, it causes the product to be runny and thin. Highly recommend just buying the cream instead. Also it smells really nice, actually more like grapes than blueberries,"
10,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t really help that much.,"Didn’t really help that much. Also the sprayer kept getting clogged frequently. I have to open the bottle and pour in my hands, yuck."
11,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too thick to be useful,"It is so oily or thick that it does not ""spray out"" like a fan, it kind of just spews out. Its just not all that practical unless you spray it in your hands and apply it, but I wanted something to spray in my hair. Returned."
12,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It rejuvenates curls, but doesn't tame frizz when used in between shampoos.","As mentioned in headline, this product does a nice job of rejuvenating curls, but the frizz is still problematic in between shampoos. I still recommend this product, as it's one of the best I've used."
13,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for 3b hair,Made my hair hard and sticky
14,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Your curls will thank you!,This product works great for my hair and my daughter’s hair.  We both have 3a-3c hair. I can put this product on my daughter’s hair and it brings her curls to life without weighing them down or having a sticky feel to them. I also use this product when wanting to add moisture to my hair when putting in flexy rods for a soft curl hairstyle.
15,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Laser beam spray,This spray comes out as a laser stream. I tried putting it into 2 different bottles that have adjustable sprays and it still came out in laser mode. I’m not sure why but it’s not a mist over the hair and that makes it difficult to spread.
16,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizing Spray,This product is not what I expected. The spray nozzle doesn’t work at all so the liquid doesn’t come out. The consistency of this product is very thick and slimy more like a gel not liquid. I’m very disappointed I wasted my money on this product. The only thing I found is that this product has a very pleasant smell and it does make my hair feel soft and moisturized but the manufacturer should reconsider the way they make the bottle because this product is definitely not meant for a spray bottle it’s too thick.
17,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,The spray is trash.,"The product might be good but the spray stream is impossible to work with, so I don’t even know if the product is good or not."
18,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Refeshing Hair!,"Yes, the sprayer doesn't spray like you'd expect it too - however I attributed to the fact that it has aloe in it. It really didn't bother me though - I would either just spray it in my hand to apply to my hair; and/or directly on my hair if I was going to twist it up for extra moisture."
19,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good,It's a little watery for a curl formula be sure to wear a towel or protective covering before using.
20,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great,Stickier than I imagined. I only use to refresh on day 2 or 3 and after my hair is wet. The smell is great. The spray bottle is awful. I spray it into my hands

I used it as the L, in my  LOC routine and it keeps my hair hydrated, plus it smells lovely. The only thing I don't like is that the sprayer gets clogged sometimes and I have to run warm water through it. But, it's a minor inconvenience."

56,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t spray,The product is good. What I don’t like is that it doesn’t come out as a spray. It comes out in a stream. It’s annoying to spray on my hair.
57,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dislike,I dislike the product it made my hair smell like Menthol

59,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype not for my hair anyways,It was way to sticky

61,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smelled like alcohol. Did notadd moisture to curls,Did not add moisture
62,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect Wash and Go Product,"This jelly comes in an 8oz bottle and I can’t believe I’m not complaining. I have used it 3 times for a wash and go and i still have 2/3 of the product left. Whaaaaaaaaat!!! Even when I feel like I’m using a lot, it turns out I’m not. it just multiplies when it leaves the bottle I guess. I was going to complain about the packaging as I would rather it comes in a jar I can just scoop out of but I think maybe this bottle is best for some of us who have no control. Hmmm.I’m torn because I found it annoying having to struggle squeezing the bottle as I went in for another application because my hands were slippery. This could be fixed by an open top container. But again, this squeeze out bottle helps regulate product usage. For my wash and go style I decided to pair the jelly with the hair milk. It’s a thicker consistency than the leave-in but lighter than the cream. This product easily absorbed into my hair while it was wet and took a little longer when dry. It’s a product that provides moisture to to the hair and is great to use on it’s own or right before applying the cream or jelly. I was able to lightly detangle my hair with it too. The jelly costs $18 for 8 oz."
63,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,My wash and go lasts longer with this product,"I have thick, coily, kindy type 4b/c hair. This product does a great job of refreshing my wash and go styles. I mist my hair with water and spray (and yes, it's more of a stream than a mist) this into my hair. I finger style and my coils are defined, shiny, and hydrated. My wash and go styles last longer when I use this product daily."
64,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,The bliss is real!,This product has made styling my natural hair soo much easier. I use out on myself and my mom! She loves it and she's extremely picky. It's a great moisturizer and smells wonderful! Soothes my itchy scalp quickly.
65,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,It is is the inefficient spray top,"I purchased this last week and replaced the cap with a stronger sprayer piece. It sprays really great with the new top. So, the gel concoction isn’t too thick if they just would put it in efficient equipment."
66,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff,"People are giving bad reviews because of how if feels or sprays out. It works, thats all you need to know"
67,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes for a good hair day everyday,"This product is a must for second day curls! Without being sticky or runny, curls blueberry bliss juice revitalizes curls for a fresh wash day look even 4 days after. My all time favorite product from this brand."
68,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't spray correctly,"Horrible spray bottle design. The formula is too thick and doesn't spray correctly. Not positive how well it works considering I can't get enough out,but smells awesome!"
69,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,This product made my hair really frizzy!!!
70,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do you want hand cramps and dry hair?,"I bought this product for my biracial son who has a LOT of long curly hair that is medium in texture but gets a bit frizzy. Well, first thing is first, when you go to spray it on the hair it comes out in a tiny STREAM instead of a spray. This makes it nearly impossible to spray directly on the hair. So, I tried spraying it in my hand. No go. I pumped it for what seemed like DAYS and only a tiny amount of the product was in my hand. So, I gave up, screwed the lid off and just started pouring it in my hand. Half a bottle later, my son's hair was just damp and soaking up this product like crazy.  NOT worth the money, and I wouldn't use it again if it was free!"
71,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, your curls will love it.","Great for keeping my 3C/4A-C curls moisterized. The spray is designed to get closer to the roots, so if you want a wide spray, transfer it to a spray bottle. The smell is not obnoxious like some products, and it does not leave your hair crunchy. I use it for my evening braids, spray, rub coconut oil in, seal with caster oil, then braid. After I take the braids out in the AM, my hair is smooth, curly, and not big and poofy."
72,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not my thing,"This doesnt really do much for my hair. The spray is not a mist, more of a stream. I just uncap it & pour the product into my hand and scissor the product into my hair. Otherwise i dobt get enough product or spend 5 minutes spraying. I will not repurchase."
73,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works Well,"My son is biracial, so I'm always looking for detangling & moisturizing products that don't contain harmful ingredients. My only complaint is that it comes out in a direct streak, instead of a spray....so hate to distribute. I thought maybe it was the spray top, so tried switching it with another one & same issue...so maybe product is too dense to come out in an actual spray/mist form?"
74,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I have thin, dry, wavy hair and am always looking for a product that will accentuate my waves without weighing down my hair or leaving it crunchy.  This stuff IS IT! I absolutely love it & it smells soooooo good! I highly recommend for people with fine/thin hair who want to accentuate their barely there curls. Thumbs up!"
75,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,product good - bottle bad,"I like the product. It perks my curls up and encourages my natural waves. I do not like the bottle. It does not spray a mist. It streams. This is useless for hair applications. So I bought a spray bottle at the drugstore and poured the product into that. C'mon, Curls, you can do better."
76,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product so far,"This is a good product. It worked well on my hair and sealed the cuticle perfectly.  I have not used it after a wash but so far so good. The solution is a bit thick so it doesn't spray instead it comes out in a stream,  that's not a big issue for me."
77,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,3c/4a,Liked it very much
78,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hair Care,Thankyou!
79,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Tried it, was fine",Indifferent on its own but not a bad addition to the curl confusion collection.
80,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Pump spray gets blocked,The spray cap does not work. The gel blocks the hole.
81,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture,Great for everyday use. Definetly adds moisture to the hair and makes it easy to comb
82,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Buying again,Works great.  Smells great.
83,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Moisturizer!,So glad I tried this. Makes my hair shiny and moisturized. I use it daily.
84,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,LOOOOOVE the blueberry scent,"LOOOOOVE the blueberry scent, but I wish the scent was stronger in this line. It only lasts faintly for about an hour after it dries. I have microlocs and I used this mainly for the scent first and moisture second. I'm now on the hunt for blueberry scented products that have a more lasting scent. To put the weakness of the scent into perspective, I have asthma and hate perfumes. If someone sits next to me and they're wearing a ton of perfume, I will get up and move. This product has a pretty nice, natural quality to it, not harsh and perfumey.Since aloe is one of the first ingredients, the liquid is more vicious than water, aalmost slimey, so I can see why the spray comes out as a stream. I tried it in another spray bottle and got the same stream-instead-of spritz results, which doesn't really bother me."
85,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for wavy low porosity hair,"I have dark blonde, low porosity waves, ranging from a 2b on top to a 3a underneath. I can’t use too many products because they weigh my hair. This doesn’t have oils or protein to weigh my hair down, it actually makes my curls pop more and moisturizes extremely well. It blends well with my diy flax seed gel, even makes that last longer. I use this first and 2nd day, I can even get a 3rd out of my style sometimes! Love this product hands down."
86,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,doesn't spray,"smells great but it's a straight, single stream; not a spray mist. can't distribute product evenly. returning!"
87,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for detangling,"I like that it doesn’t leave my hair feeling gunky or weighed down. If I use it alone once my hair absorbs it, it’ll feel kind of dry but it looses my hair up and with the leave in conditioner it is very soft and moist without being to oily. I don’t even feel the need to wash the product off my hands when I’m done working it into my hair which is soooo rare!!!"
88,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Berrys only,I love this because it smells good and it has aloe in but it doesn’t moisturize my hair at all and the sprayer does not ever work you have to pour it into your hand instead...
89,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite curl product!,I use this on day 2 or 3 hair and sometimes on day 4 or 5. I apply on dry curls and the freshen back up. I even get added volume when using this product. It is currently my favorite curly hair product and always have it on hand.
90,"Curls Aloe & Blueberry Juice Curl Moisturizer, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Smells good, and works well but it leaves the hair feeling sticky and unpleasant after it has dried. But it does that job well.The pump didn’t work on my spray bottle so I have to empty some onto my hand to apply to my hair, which ends up in me wasting some as it drips from my hands which I find frustrating as it’s an expensive product."

0,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Blisfull,"I like this oil because unlike MOST oils, it actually absorbs in my hair.  It has a nice smell, which for me could actually be stronger, and I would say it's added to my hair health by upping the shine (not overly so) and I've seen growth after using the whole bottle. I use 2-3 times per week in the shower after my hair's been misted with the water spray.  I'd recommend and I'd purchase again... I would like to see a lower price point or a larger bottle priced more reasonably."
1,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Good/Light,This is hands down my favorite oil I have ever used. I feel like it has already made my hair grow in the month I have had it. I use it to scalp massage every night and also to apply to my hair (after the BB leave in). I also apply it to dry hair when my ends feel brittle or when I braid my hair. It is super moisturizing yet light weight and doesn't leave your hair feeling greasy. It smells so good sometimes I use it as a massage oil or body oil. A little goes a long way!
2,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Personally i enjoy the smell of this product so much,"Personally i enjoy the smell of this product so much, i practically bought this product on the smell alone. No report on hair growth yet.I use this product along with the leave-in conditioner AND the control paste when i style my hair. It's never been so soft and my curls are so much more defined than ever before. Some people have even commented about the curls of my hair! I'm a mexican girl with naturally loose curls, almost wavy hair. Now my curls seem stronger and more bouncy since using this product and the other blueberry bliss products!I'm pretty sure i'll be a lifelong customer :)"
3,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect light oil for 3c curly hair!,"When I usually use oils, they can be very heavy on my hair and it leaves behind a residue because it doesn't fully absorb but not with this oil!Not only does it have a very subtle, sweet smell to it, it actually absorbs into my hair and keeps it moisturized! I highly recommend to use it with your everyday wash and go style routine! I thought the bottle would be a bit bigger but you really only need a few drops applied to your scalp and ends. I part my hair into 4 sections and apply the oil to my roots and ends for each section and its been working fine!"
4,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for wavy/curly hair,I love the blueberry scent! It adds shine after I scrunch my gel cast out of my wavy/curly hair! I used to purchase it at target but haven’t been able to find it there in a year! I love the scent
5,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice oil,"I was very apprehensive about trying another hair oil, I have tried MANY.  I have very fine, curly hair, that tends to frizz VERY EASILY!  I constantly try to moisturize and condition my hair with all sorts of different oils and natural products that are healthy for hair. I was pleasantly surprised that this oil seems to work pretty well. It smells nice, and is not too heavy on my fine hair.  I often mix a little of this oil with a small amount of Olaplex No 3, and smooth it into my hair, and comb it through.  It seems to work quite well at calming and smoothing my easy to frizz hair.  I am pleasantly surprised and pleased."
6,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works a treat,"I’ve been using it for a month now and have definitely noticed that my hair feels more “full” at the roots and has even grown a few inches. It smells amazing at first application! The only thing I would say is that after it’s been massaged in it has a weird smell? It’s not terrible but it’s not pleasant lol. If you can get past that, then it’s a great product"

10,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT FOR CURLS!! LOVE THE SMELL!!,"I was recommended by a friend and the curls company instagram. I am completely satisfied as of now. I can't necessarily compare my growth, but I can definitely say it left mine and my daughter's hair bouncy and shiny. I have really tight curls and she has looser ones. ( will attach pictures after)."
11,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good oil but came spilled,"Smells great, very light. It's the first oil I've been able to put directly on my scalp that absorbed entirely with no residue. Only problem is that it came without a safety seal and half of it had spilled in the box..."
12,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Reconsider your purchase!,"I was very disappointed when I saw the bottle. The bottle is very small, enough to hold with one hand.

0,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Has a nice tingling sensation,"Ive been using this daily., and scalp massaging after. Has a nice tingling sensation, and a very fresh smell. It doesnt leave your hair greasy looking as it absorbs well. I also noticed all of my dandruff has went away. On top of all the other things in my hair routine, this has helped a ton in my growth! ( I did another big chop 4/2/18 )UPDATE FEBRUARY 2019 —- still continuing to use this oil, I have went through so many bottles since last year. Here’s a hair update! Hair when pulled is down to collarbone length now, going to continue using this oil to keep my follicules and scalp refreshed and stimulated."
1,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,These products are likely expired,"After checking out the batch number on my bottle I figured out why these bottles never work the same do as the ones I buy directly from the store or from Target. The product I received was over a year old.  While many people use lotions, shampoos, conditioners, or even makeup past the expiration date, many of these products tend to lose their potency past their expiration date. I bought this product twice from this vendor and noticed that although it still has the same smell as a new bottle of curls oil, I notice that I saw no benefits or felt the scalp relief that I feel while using the product when I buy direct from Curls or from Target. Maybe these are isolated incidents but I do not think so."
2,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Heaven for dry hair,"I have a very busy lifestyle and when I am under stress my scalp ALWAYS gets so dry. If I am under extreme pressure I'll even begin to lose some hair which is unnoticeable because it's so thick but nerve wracking all the same. This product is a miracle, it is from my favorite bran and smells divine. The mint in the tea is cooling to the touch so sometimes I even use this as a massage oil for achey muscles.The oils are all high quality, low comedogenic rating as I know for a fact they get all over my face at night via the pillowcase and I have yet to see any issues. It has never irritated my skin it or caused a breakout, in fact if anything it's probably helps, my incredibly sensitive skin is extremely breakout prone if I put certain products on it. I have seen improvement in my hair growth and the mild cooling effects of the mint help soothe any pain or discomfort on my scalp."
3,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing tingles but medicine smell.,"I do agree with others that it makes your scalp feel amazing after you apply it. It is a cool and tingly sensation-- I love that factor.The smell really bothers me though-- it truly smells like liquid benadryl. Not a good smell but not a terrible one.Also, this hasn't really helped much with my dryness which disappointed me.It was an okay product but I will be looking for a different treatment."
4,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Itchy Scalps Rejoice!!,I saw this used on a YouTube video by Curly Penny Tovar. She mentioned that she had dry scalp and so do I so I bought it hoping for the best. It really is magical. I use it during the week and before washing my hair. I already bought another bottle.
5,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Feels Amazing! Expect good results.,"This product came in a box, neatly packaged and very wrapped in bubble wrap.

I've only been using it for two days but it is looking and feels very promising. Would recommend!"
6,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not recommended for sensitive scalps,Not recommended for sensitive scalps.

87,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,It grows your hair without a doubt 😉,Amazing. I started using in February after going through some health issues. I chopped my hair off and I've had awesome results. Really. I don't ever do reviews but I had to on this product because it actually came through for me🤗
88,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for toddlers 3-4 years old. Age 6 and up should be fine.,This formula is  too strong for younger children. My youngest daughter's scalp startee to ooze and crust. There were huge scabs in her scalp. It worked fine for me.
89,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,my scalp loves this scalp elixir,Man my scalp loves this stuff. can't say that enough i use it to massage scalp and it is devine no issue with the scent for me. i normally pay $13 in local stores. WORSE CASE scenario i MAY pay the $21 here if i have absolutely no choice
90,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cured a long-time, horrifying scalp issue; PURCHASED FROM CURLS SITE","I won't go into the scalp issue too much, but suffice to say it involved severe itching, sores, and picking. It has lasted for years through every kind of treatment both medical and homeopathic. After using the CURLS shampoo, conditioner, and stylers... I noticed some scalp spots coming up. Applied this scalp treatment and by the next morning, the spots were eliminated.I will update after a few weeks of use, but for today... my scalp feels AMAZING."
91,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Winter is coming!,"Yes! I love this stuff. I’m experimenting with all different kinds of scalp treatment right now but this one is what I use for heavy treatments before shampooing. My scalp is so dry right now because winter is coming. It’s a bit itchy in the summer but way worse fall/winter. The little dropper is perfect for finding the scalp spots. If you warm coconut oil and then mix this in, the tingle isn’t so strong. I just put my hair in a bonnet and leave it in an hour or over night and wash and condition like normal. My scalp will stay moisturized for the week. I should have been treating my scalp a long time ago. I’m late to the game. Now I don’t have to worry about the flakes and people looking at me crazy. Dry scalp is embarrassing."
92,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Shedding,This product has made my hair fail out i know it was this because this is the only thing I started using new im not talking small amounts of hair coming out its large amounts and I have bold spots in the area I put this stuff on I wouldn't recommend this. If you want you hair to grow use sea moss  Turmeric or biotin pills it works I use it and my hair is past my bra strap when my hair was on my neck now I have to work on getting my hair back to thick.
93,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Relieved Scalp,"I went natural back in 2013, and as time went on, I realized that my scalp started flaking and even hurt a little. I did a little research for scalp treatments and found this one. Not only does it smell good, it makes your scalp feel AMAZING! It's almost always sold out on the website which is a testament to just how good it is. This is definitely a product, among many others, that I will continue to use from this brand."
94,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Serum,I love this moisturizing serum so much better than Kaleidoscope. I love the thickness of this serum. The peppermint works a few minutes after applying.
95,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,It does what it says; stimulating.,"I am looking for products my hair will love and deliver what they put in writing. This is my first impression and I can tell you say I am loving it. It’s light, and you feel the tingly sensation as soon as you start to massage it in. When using right after washing as I did, the tingly feels intense in a good way. I will return to review after using it for a few weeks."
96,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fabulous product, and saved me money also.","I had itchy scalp, no cause, no bigger problem, and the MD prescribed a numbing agent that smelled icky. This is a much better option that smell nice and calms everything down for months. And it costs less too. Love the product!!."
97,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This! My # 1 Stunna!!!!,"On the days when I don’t wear my hair straight, I use this on my scalp, a small bit on the hair and a bit on the ends. I typically part off 4 sections and twist each section into a spiraled knot and keep it clipped for an hour or two. This is what it looks like when I take it down. I always get compliments. My hair is relaxed, by the way."
98,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,This is not good for people with super dry scalp or dermatitis,The oil has a tingling sensation to your scalp but once it’s fully dry in your scalp it makes the scalp with super dry flakes that makes it worst. My scalp was full of white dry scabs from the dry oil. Won’t ever use again
99,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loveeeee it!!,I’ve used this for about 3 months now. I use it as a treatment the night before I shower and let it sit on my scalp. The tingly feeling it leaves is amazinggg I always give a nice scalp massage with it and I love doing it once a week! I have definitely seen hair growth my hair seems to be getting longer and I’ve noticed other little baby hairs coming to life around my hair line. My roots always feel very moisturized and even shiner after I use this. I highly recommend!!
100,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cut my shedding in half!!,"My hair has been shedding horribly in the shower for a long time. After one week of using this product, I washed my hair and literally saw half the amount of hair come out then what I am typically used to. I am so excited! Usually my scalp gets itchy and dry after a few days, but not anymore! I def recommend this product. It's very soothing and it tingles all day long."
101,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,No more scalp itch,"Love this product. The first time I used it, it worked.

106,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for dry flaky scalp,"I'm a curly hair girl, and my scalp had been destroyed by using Devacurl products. My scalp has been dry, itchy, and flaky for several months now, long after I have quit using Devacurl. There were dandruff flakes the size of quarters falling off of my scalp, it was terrible. I have been frantically looking for products to save my scalp from this allergic reaction it's been having, and I am so glad I bought this product. I massage this oil into my scalp as soon as I get out of the shower, and it gives my scalp such a nice, cool, tingly feeling.  A little goes a long way with this product. My dandruff and flakiness has gone down significantly since I started applying this oil to my scalp, and my scalp is much happier. I highly recommend it."
107,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,"So greasy, poor design","I have NBR extensions and my scalp has been really itchy in a reaction - no dandruff, just intense itching. I was looking for a product to alleviate the itching and decided to try this. I've only been applying for three days, so I can't fully attest to the effectiveness (maybe slight improvement?), but I might have to return. The product is so oily that my hair instantly looks like it hasn't been washed in weeks after I apply and since the bottle says to apply daily and not rinse off, I can't apply in the morning or I would need to shower from the greasiness before I left the house-- and I'd have to wash my hair daily (I don't know many hair types that are good with daily washing. Mine certainly isn't). I've been applying at night, but then I have to sleep with a towel over my pillow so I don't destroy it and then still have wash my hair every morning. The eyedropper applicator leaks everywhere and makes it really hard to spread the liquid evenly. A squeeze bottle with a fine tip would be much more effective. I don't think I'm willing to trade any benefit I might be seeing from the product for the hassle of application, sleeping on a towel, and dried out hair from too frequent washing."
108,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,This oil will leave you feeling like you did something good for your hair and scalp.,"I tried this for the first time yesterday. I'm giving it four stars for how this oil smells and feels.The scent is very zen like and it feels tingly on the scalp, but not in a bad way. I can not say if it promotes hair growth or not( will update with growth results) I just know it feels and smells amazing."
109,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this scalp treatment!,"I LOVE this scalp treatment. Smells divine. The consistency is not too watery or too thick. Feels great on my scalp and is definitely helping. I recently tried their shampoos and conditioners, too. I don’t know if they changed the formula since I first tried them over a decade ago (literally), but they are amazing now and have replaced my old reliable, which is no longer being made."

A little really goes a long way,"This treatment is really moisturizing on my scalp and smells great! A little really goes a long way, I don't really need more than 1 dropper full. If I use more than that my hair is a little greasy and needs to get washed. I have noticed that my baby hair around my hairline (that never used to grow) is starting to grow in more too! The only reason I'm not giving this product 5 stars is because I had bought it with the intention of extending my days between washing and even though it's very soothing on my scalp, relieves itching too, it definitely makes me a little greasy."

129,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,😌 ahhh... just what my scalp needed,"Okay so I’m doing this review because I want to put my two cents in on this product.. I purchased it at Target because I was too impatient to order it, and needed it ASAP! Summer is here and I sweat like a man in this heat.. once I’m indoors cooled off my scalp gets maaaad itchy.. to the point my scalp is sore the next day from scratching so much or either I co-wash my hair if I’m just too sweaty.. I don’t want to wash my hair too much because of the whole process I do to get it moisturized before my hair dries all the way.. This oil is a straight miracle for my 4c type hair.. my Afro on point my scalp is nice and cool and tingly when I go out in the heat of the summer.. i still sweat but my head isn’t itchy asfk and feels so good after I wash my hair... this oil will be part of my hair routine forever 🤗  I highly recommend this to everybody who has dry scalp.. especially in the summer ☀️"
130,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cured my dandruff.,I haven't been using it long enough to know if it's making my hair grow faster but it definately improved the condition of my scalp. I no longer get dandruff and can now go longer between washes where I couldn't go more than 3 days without developing scaliness. The smell is overpowering but it doesn't stay for very long and eventually disappears entirely. It also helps balance oil production because I notice my scalp doesn't get as oily anymore.
131,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works...,I lost my hair due to stress. I started using this product months ago and my hair is growing back at a rapid pace. It relieves itching and moisturize your hair at the same time. I am almost out and ordering more. I highly recomnend it!
132,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Dry Itchy Scalps!,"My scalp has gone through it this winter and I have a couple of dry patches that itch and are sore. On wash day after air drying I apply this product to my trouble spots and massage it in; my scalp has recovered. It soaks in well relieving itching and the mint soothes the soreness. I'm going to stock pile this product, it's that good."
133,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this oil!,This makes my hair grow so fast! And it has a refreshing tingling feeling! Love it! 10/10 my favorite oil!
134,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Refreshing, cooling, and helps hair grow",I bought this to use on my box braids to help keep my scalp moisturized. It is a great product. It tingles and feels great on your head. And it has helped my hair grow a lot!
135,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This worked to keep the itching under my extensions at bay. I liked the drop bottle design which helps to apply to the right itching spot. I liked the smell and I applied twice a day and massaged into my scalp to help blood flow. I had some regrowth and the itching stopped completely after a few days although I still continued to use it as a moisturiser.I also used it for my weak edges and mixed it with keracare.It worked but after a few days the dropper came loose and it became difficult to use. The dropper was not durable but the oil worked
136,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This product has really helped my dry scalp condition which only came on recently. It arrived quickly and whilst it’s a little pricey you do get a fair amount in the bottle! Also worth it as itching stopped straightaway and it has a very mild tingling soothing effect ! Love !
137,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I've been using the product on and off for around 8 months now and it really does thicken your hair and aid hair growth.

138,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,You definitely feel like it's working as it tingles your scalp -but I cannot securely say that I have noticed any visible improvements yet.

142,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Love the smell and the affect it has on my scalp.
143,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,The product itself I’ve used before and have had good results for my sensitive scalp. I ordered two bottles and one arrived with the lid cracked.
144,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,The oil  inside the containers  is leaking out because the bottle is  broken before they bring it I need a replacement.Thanks from Esther.
145,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Really great product.
146,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This was recommended to me by a esthetician and she used this herself for her scalp and hair issues and worked amazing for her. I have psoriasis on my scalp and have tired alot of things but this really helps. I love the tingling and the smell is so nice I could use it as a body spray. I use it every day and more the day I'm going to wash my hair to let it sit in. It doesn't feel greasy as it's pretty runny. I hope it helps my hair grow. The only thing is the lid cracked the day I got it so needs to be stronger. The plastic is cheap but the rest of the bottle is nice. This will last me a while so that's great. Wish it was a bit cheaper but it works so I'll pay it.
147,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I've been battling dermatitis for the past 4 years, its gotten bad in the past year. I've tried a lot of products and routines to battle it and nothing has worked, just constant dry, red flaking scalp. I could wash my hair on Monday, be flaky by the time it dried and it would be unbearable by Wednesday. With this I was able to go a week without the flaking and excessive dryness and I didn't even use it daily like it suggests. All the dry patches cleared up and I wasn't constantly having to dust off my clothes. I don't know if it grows your hair, but I don't care the dryness relief has been amazing."

149,"Curls Blueberry & Mint Tea Scalp Treatment, 4 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"The applied on the scalp the oil made my hair very very greasy, and I had to wash my hair right after. I did not see any noticeable new growth. I also did not enjoy the smell which reminded me of old blueberries with a dash of mint. The product did give a nice tingly feeling on my scalp."

0,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Twist-N-Shout Cream, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,My 1st staple product,"This is my 1st staple product in my natural hair journey of almost 2 yrs. I've purchased this multiple times. My 2 strand twists actually hold for long wear use. Also, when I actually take out the twists they're so defined,  I can usually get a full 2wks if I wanted to, but the most I've ever really gone is 9 days because I'm used to washing my hair 2x/ week, but can get away with longer days in cooler weather. Curls blueberry bliss products are awesome"
1,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Twist-N-Shout Cream, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE Curls hair products,"I've been using Curls products for over 10 years and love them!! I have natural curly hair and these products are the only products that keep my hair tamed and friz free without too much sheen and oil. I usually purchase these products on the Curls site but the shipping takes a long time. With Prime, I can get these products within two days; I love the convenience of that!!"
2,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Twist-N-Shout Cream, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,2nd time purchase! Loved it!,"This is my second time purchasing the twist and shout cream and I love it! I use it in place of gel and it holds my twists and is perfect addition for defined hairstyles. I used the last one to the last drop. It absorbs quickly, smells pleasant and is a versatile stying aid. I cant think of anything bad about it. I would recommend it for wet and dry hairstyling and it is wonderful on natural, unprocessed hair."
3,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Twist-N-Shout Cream, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn’t empressed,I love the Blueberry curl products so I thought this was going to work out well. However I like the blueberry Jell better for twistouts than this particular product. The jell makes my hair super shiny like I came from the salons. This product doesn’t have that same effect

29,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Twist-N-Shout Cream, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,These details are necessary Bc you came here for facts,"1. I have 4a texture curls2. My curls are typically parched and suck up moisture like a sponge and then dry out like a battery tossed in riceI have previously tried as I am, curls whipped curl cream + eco styled gel, shea moisture. As I am left my hair defined but dry. Shea moisture left my hair moisturized but frizzy. My best success has been with the whipped curl cream + eco styler gel - but Walgreens was out of that when I went so I had to be adventurous. I’m also always trying to consolidate. And I’d be lying if I said my mid-week style refresher didn’t involve a second helping of hair products, water, and combing.On Saturday, I washed my hair with mane choice pink lemonade. I conditioned with Camille rose (not my first choice, Walgreens was also out of the TGIN that I like). I deep conditioned with TGIN hair mask. Even after the mask, after towel drying my hair, it was a little parched. This usually happens if I use shampoo shampoo and not my as I am cleansing conditioner.I used the curls blueberry leave in when I divided my hair into sections. I was surprised by the time I made it to that section of hair how moisturized it was. I then used the blueberry grow oil (not sure if it makes your hair grow but remember i have dry hair and scalp, so I’m trying to moisturize this dry winter) on my scalp and the twist & shout cream. This is why you’re here. You want to know whether or not it will change your life. I don’t know whether it’ll change your life, but it changed mine.My hair is both defined and moisturized. It’s tuesday and time for my mid-week style refresher and I didn’t even have to rake through my curls with my wide tooth comb. I didn’t need to add product. My hair has slip, shine and softness - while not being weighed down and heavy. This has never happened in all my 10 years of natural hair. What I also love is that it smells delicious. I hesitated on writing this review because it’s so soon. Will this product be as amazing to me 2 weeks from now? I don’t know. But I am glad Walgreens was out of my original purpose because my hair looks and smells great.Everyone’s hair is different, but maybe you’ll have the same joy I had."

1,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome for fine curly hair!,"My fine, curly hair LOVES THIS PRODUCT!I used it to cowash, then applied more as a leave-in with about a quarter sized amount of gel, finger coiled, and air dried. It doesn't weigh my hair down and my hair didn't frizz despite the humidity."
2,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent leave in for 2c/3a,"This is a great leave-in. I prefer the plain leave in, but this product has a bit of hold too.Pros: light blueberry scent, fairly clean ingredients, curly girl friendly, cuts frizz, adds a bit of weight and moisture without greasiness, concentrated, scent dissipates quickly and plays well with most other products, fair price. I alternate the leave in from this brand’s  and KCKT.Bottom line: I recommend the leave in over the hair milk. The deep conditioner and pomade are great too."
3,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!!,"this is the BEST! after one single use i’m seeing amazing results. either my old leave-in was crap, or this stuff is amazing. my hair immediately curled up when i raked it through (and i tend to be on the wavier side (2b)), it is SO much softer than normal, feels light and bouncy, smells amazing! My hair is pretty thick and medium length, just recently got it cut so no damage. I’ve already recommended to my curly friends"
4,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Frizz free curls,Great product! I almost didn't buy it because of a review I read about it containing sulfates. I did my own research and it's actually not a sulfate. Buy it! 💙
5,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really love this product,"I really love this product.  I recently discovered this brand and oh my God, they are really amazing, they define my curl but still feels soft.  I combine this with the Blueberry Bliss moisturizer leave in and the Blueberry Bliss gel"
6,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Like the smell, be wary for fine hair","I have fine hair and I think this might be a liiiitle too heavy. I'll still finish it up and it works decently as a leave in but I think its a little too heavy and I need to make sure not to use to much, or end up with a waxy residue in my hair.Smells decent though, and thank god smell doesn't linger"
7,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lighter weight version of the leave in, perfect for 2c/3a fine hair!","This product is perfect for thick, fine 2c hair! I’ve struggled to find a leave in that didn’t weigh my hair down or break out my skin, and usually I just use regular conditioner which does weigh my hair down. This is almost as moisturizing as the blueberry bliss leave in conditioner but doesn’t feel as heavy ! My curls came out great on wash day, which is usually my worst day because of the weight of my hair. Can’t wait to see how it holds up on the refresh!"
8,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Moisturizer,Overall the product is very good and it does provide moist to my hair. I  diluted it with water and placed it in a spray bottle to apply my scalp and hair.  If not it would clump together and leave the white color milky lotion visible on my hair. It smells good and appears to be working out well. I would recommend
9,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for after Shower Curls!!,"Omg I totally love this product., it has helped me here in humid FL like a beast! I have to add something else to cure my curls but this helps me on days I don't have to and lets me add to it when I want to be on display! I love it as a base or a lazy day!!  Thank you!!"
10,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok.,Has a nice scent. But it's thicker than expected and I find it difficult to smooth through my hair. It helps with frizz but I don't really recommend for fine curly hair
11,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells too strong,"I love a spray I have from Curls so I decided to try this but I don't like it nearly as well.  The smell is pretty strong and it makes my hair feel kind of greasy while it's in. It does moisturize well, though, so I just only put it on when I'm not planning on going out."
12,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps with the frizz and definition,I love the smell of this! But I also like that it actually helps with frizz and definition of curls.

15,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely for natural hair,This does wonders to my hair! So much easier to use than the leave in and my hair is super soft and I can actually comb through the curls (3B/C-4A hair)

36,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype,"This leave in is really hyped up in the wavy and curly hair community. I normally avoid products with coconut oil, but decided to give this a try due to everyone recommending it. My first issue is the smell. It smells like a blue Jolly Rancher. If you're into that type of smell that's great, but I'm not a fan of my hair smelling like candy. My second issue is that it doesn't feel like it does anything for my hair. It feels amazing going on and it has great slip, but every time my hair dried after using this it would feel crunchy and dry. I also didn't notice any difference in frizz. This isn't an issue I've had with other leave in conditioners with protein. I suspect it's mostly likely due to the coconut oil. I wish companies would stop pushing coconut oil when it's known not to be a moisturizer. It just sits on your skin and hair and does nothing. This product makes my hair feel so bad I don't even feel like using it up. Please learn from my mistake and avoid this product if you know you don't like using coconut oil in your beauty regime."
37,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,It left white globs of it in my hair (Blueberry Coconut Hair Milk),"Every time I used it, it left some little white globs in my hair, which I then had to pick out.  There was no other product in my hair when it deposited the globs. Other than that annoyance, it seems to have good conditioning properties. No, I would not buy this product again."
38,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,It's not just hair....it's self care!,I needed something for my 3A/3B hair and this line is PERFECT. It smells amazing and feels like it was made for me.  Bought the whole line. Doing my hair is now part of my self care routine.
39,"Curls Blueberry & Coconut Hair Milk, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for Curls and Waves,I use this everyday and my curls have never been better or more alive.

It feels nice when I first apply it to damp hair but once it dries, my hair feels dry and 'inside frizzy' if that makes sense. I don't necessarily have a halo of frizz but inbetween my waves/curls there is so much frizz. Might work for some, but it was too expensive to keep considering the results."

0,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,AWESOME product.,The smell is amazing. Did a deep condition with this following the directions exactly. I used a plastic treatment cap with a microwaveable heated deep conditioning cap over it. Left it for 25 minutes. Rinsed out and styled as normal. My curls were flawless. This is definitely now a part of my weekly routine.
1,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,It smells so good. Its very creamy and thick,"I have mixed feeling about this mask. It smells so good. Its very creamy and somewhat thick with a smooth texture. Application is very good with this mask. I do feel like i need to use it a few more time to see real results. Maybe my hair is not damaged so I didn't get the full benefit. I must say, the twist out cream in this line is divine. I absolutely love it. If you didn't get enough moisture from the mask, the cream will definitely do it. Plus, if you pair the cream and the jelly, beautiful result. My hair held moisture for days. Great line"
2,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells heavenly! Works great too!,"This stuff is fantastic! I have thin, fine wavy hair and it works great for me! It's super thick and I worried it would be to heavy, but it's perfect. I am using this product once a week for 15 minutes with heat.Honestly my favorite thing about this product is probably the scent! It's wonderful! I am extremely sensitive to fragrances (mainly artificial fragrances) and frequently get massive migraines because of them, so you can imagine I don't get to use many wonderful smelling products. When I saw this brand uses natural fragrances, I had to try it. I am so happy I did. It smells like blueberries but also reminds me a bit of cotton candy. The best part is no headache!"
3,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good hair mask, leaves the hair soft","It’s a good hair mask but no different than any other that I’ve bought in the drug store. Does the job though, but not as amazingly as some reviews and comments I’ve hear about it. Pretty much for the price, I would stick to the regular Garnier Fructis Intensive Repair mask that you can get at Walmart for $2 in a small size. I like the smell though and I can say it has a good slip. Great thing about it is that it’s free of sulfates, parabens and silicons."
4,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing!,"My hair loves this conditioner. I have a lot of fine very curly hair. It was feeling dry (too much protein not enough moisture) and nothing was helping it return to its normal texture. I bought this on a whim and use it every time I cleanse my hair and after just a few weeks my hair is back to being super soft and bouncy. I’m honestly not a huge fan of the scent, but I use so many other hair products that by the time I’m done with my hair I can’t even smell this product anymore so it really doesn’t matter to me. I will be buying more."
5,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not glycerin free!,"This product is NOT glycerin free. Disappointed that there was no ingredients listed. I asked the question and was told it was but it is NOT glycerin free. However, it is low on the list which is ok. Very nice blueberry smell. Went on thick and creamy. Haven’t washed and dried yet but so far it feels ok. Idk how this will work with the other products I’ve used tho so we will see. $$ price range. Does have some oils and proteins. CGM approved"
6,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable and effective,AMAZING product. I use this once a week as my deep conditioner and it is the best product for my hair I have found on the market. I've been on the lookout for a affordable and quality product for a year and this is it. It also lasts me a long time and I find that my hair absorb much more water and curl pattern after using this product.

Starting using this mask once a week in the shower while using the curl jelly after and my curls have been softer and more defined after only a month! Make sure you shampoo before use though, otherwise you'll get a bit of buildup around your roots."
12,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, horrible packaging","This product is so creamy and luxurious. The smell is incredible without being overpowering. My only problem with it is I noticed, after I opened it while in the shower that the lid is cracked. I had planned on leaving it in the shower for ease of use but I can’t with the cracked lid."
13,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad,"This isn't a life changing deep conditioner, but it works fine. It smells nice and I'll use it until it's gone, but it doesn't moisturize as well as some others I have used. My hair gets dry so I need something really heavy duty."
14,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so Good and Protects Even Better,It smells amazing and does an equal job in the moisturizing department. My hair feels soft and well coated when I use their product. I also have less breakage.
15,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love this product!!,This product has helped me maintain my curl pattern (I have 3c hair). My hair when I get out of the shower is easily detangled and super soft and smooth. The scent can sometimes be a bit much for me (it's a bit atrong) but it is pleasant. Also the fact that I dont need to use a lot of product helps save my coins.
16,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Blueberry Smell is no Joke,"I found this on a list for good protein-heavy deep conditioners. It's effective- as a conditioner I really like it, it has great slip and leaves my hair feeling both strong and silky. I cannot get over the smell; it literally smells like a blueberry muffin or maybe cotton candy? I don't like smelling like candy or food so I will probably keep looking for a good protein treatment for my curls."

18,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money! Doesn’t condition or moisturize!,Not impressed at all! I’m glad it was cheap but in all honesty I have purchased cheaper and got better results! There is no moisture I get better conditioning from .99 cent conditioners. You would think that it would work great being how think it is. Nope! It’s junk! Only good thing about this product is the smell. Other than that save your money!
19,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,MY #1 GO TO PRODUCT,"What can I say?! This product is hydrating and always leaves my hair smelling lovely. I have been using this product consistently for the past 3 years and I have no intention to replace it. After a deep condition I detangle, part  and apply the product separately to each parted portion for a twist out. I comb through again, braid the roots half down then twist the ends. The twist out can last up to a week & a half, thank me later :)"
20,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but may be too heavy for some,"I like it, but I think it’s a little too heavy for my fine, wavy/curly hair. So from now on, I will use it as a pre-poo mask for my hair. That way I can get the weight out of my hair when I am done using it."
21,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,strong artificial smell,"If you are sensitive to smells, this stuff isn't for you. It smells strong, cheap, and artificial.I get migraines triggered by strong perfumey scents and as soon as I opened this stuff I started to get a headache. Also it didn't even really do much for my hair."
22,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice scent, defines and hydrates!",Works great after I shampoo and use conditioner. My curls feel very hydrated and my curl pattern is more defined. Definitely works for me and my daughters hair!

This hair mask gives my hair the protein it needs. I have fine, high porosity hair and this mask gave my hair its definition back. I use it once every 1-2 weeks. I'm starting to see waves again! The mask is also hydrating enough that i don't always need to use another conditioner afterward. I do use a pea-sized amount of the leave-in from this same line, just to help with detangling afterward. The blueberry scent is really nice too, but not overpowering."
96,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves curls moisturized,"I love this hair mask!

104,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCUSE ME WHAT?,"I will update with pictures once I am home but my hair dried at work and I just had to leave a review. I started the CGM a month and a half ago after heat styling for over a year. I've been experimenting with different products but my wash days were mostly bad, frizzy messes, dull, undefined, had wet frizz soft and limp. I was about to give up on the CGM until I read up on the moisture/protein balance. I decided to try a bit of protein and this mask was recommended in a curly Facebook group. I was seriously NOT expecting this...  this made my hair so shiny it almost looks like a wig. My curls are defined, the frizz is minimal and I didn't even plop or diffuse. I was not expecting my hair to look this good on a wash and go. I shampooed with Giovanni Tea Tree, put this mask on using praying hands and squish to condish then detangled, used my heat cap for 30 minutes, rinsed, added the Curls Blueberry gel and the Totally Twisted mousse and air dried and my hair has never looked healthier. This stuff is seriously a miracle. If you have type 2 wavy hair that is medium/fine you NEED this.  I love the entire Curls line and I use their leave in, cream and gel but this is hands down their best product and will become a staple, to keep the protein/moisture balance use this mask once a month and a moisturizing mask once a month."
105,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,It's okay,"I like the fact that this is ""curly-girl method approved"" without silicones, drying alcohols, or harsh surfactants. The smell is subtle and sweet, but does not stick to the hair once rinsed out and dried. (I am very sensitive to smells and this did not bother me, though some reviewers had a different experience). I have fine, frizzy, 2A-type hair that is easily weighed down, but also needs a fair bit of moisture / loses moisture at the ends throughout the day. This mask did a fair job of moisturizing my hair without weighing it down, which was surprising to me. It did help some with my frizz, but most deep-conditioners help me out in that department. I only require a small amount (2 tbsp or so?) to saturate mid-shaft to ends of my hair, which falls 3 inches below my collar bone.For $15, I'd say it's a good find as far as hair masks go, but surely there are better ones out there. I could probably use this a few times per week, or maybe even as a daily conditioner for the ends of my hair only. It contains hydrolyzed soy protein, soy bean oil (high on the ingredients list) and coconut oil (low on the ingredients list)."
106,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good CG friendly hairmask,"So I've used this product a couple times now. Mostly I use it in the shower if i feel like my conditioner needs a little extra. It works good. It smells amazing (though you have to like blueberries, which i do). The scent lingers on the hair after too which is a plus.It moisturizes, and helps with tangles. I feel like it really helps.I definitely will be repurchasing when my container runs out. Though i would like to point out that the container is smaller then normal hair mask size, which surprised me when it arrived (I am too lazy to check sizes on line so thats my fault) but its thicker consistency makes it feel as if it is doing more then a thinner one (?? I dont know how to describe).Anyways. I found it very enjoyable for a weekly hairmask."
107,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Strong smell, great product","I'm so glad there is a silicon free deep conditioner! I noticed a slight difference after the first use (which is impressive for any hair product) , I used it on my newly color treated hair and it helped rejuvenate it. It's curly girl friendly!! The smell is not my favorite, but it's not horrible, not enough to drop a star. The smell lasts all day and sometimes even into the next day."
108,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Updated review.,"I wrote too early. After several uses, I realize I will not order this again. It has little slip - other deep conditioners I use for my natural hair permit me to detangle easily as I apply their products. Also, leaves my hair feeling more waxy-coated than moisturized. Finally, after several uses and ability to compare with other products, I find the fragrance cloying."
109,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super soft hair,Only thing that’s helped my waves so far! Nice that it doesn’t smell like coconut like everything else.

131,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Lacking slip,Did not provide appropriate slip as TGIN. Causes breaking trying to rake comb through (3ab) hair. There it out after two uses. I’ll stick to TGIN.
132,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your money,"Doesn’t smell as good as the shampoo, and it certainly doesn’t deliver on its promises. Pantene’s 3 minute miracle conditioner works better, smells better and costs less."

138,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product at affordable price,"The scent isn’t my favorite but it’s not strong and doesn’t linger on the hair. this product is really well balanced between providing good moisture and slip while also providing the benefits of protein for my 2B/2C wavy hair.  It left my hair soft but not weighed down, and gave me good curl/wave definition.  It’s better than higher priced items I have tried.  I definitely recommend."
139,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Used it for the first time last night. I let my hair absorb the mask for 25 minutes and rinsed it. The smell is very nice and gentle like a blueberry cake. It is a bit pricey and the package is not very big but I will purchase again.

144,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Didn't work on my natural hair... the product just sat on my hair , it did not penetrate my hair strands"
145,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Love this mask!!!!I have 2C- 3A type curls, and I have a lot of hair, but very thin individual hair strands. So I deal with a lot of frizz on a daily, and my hair does tend to get quite dry due to the curls!I’ve been using this mask once a week for two months now, and it’s worked wonders! It smells quite interesting, and the texture is pretty thick. But it didn’t weigh my hair down, and my curls have been so well defined and soft!I’ve been avoiding heat on my hair for the last five months now, so this mask has definitely helped bring back softness and definition to my curls! Even on day 3 after my washes, my curls are still beautiful!Been getting quite a lot of compliments since using this product! Definitely worked well for me! But remember, everyone is different and it takes time to see a difference!"
146,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I really like this masks. It leaves my hair feeling moisturized/soft after and its got great slip. I do feel like this mask is pretty expensive, but this brand a bit pricier just in general. The blueberry curls line has a really strong scent, reminiscent of blue gatorade or slushee - which doesn't smell bad, but it is strong and not necesarily a scent i want year round (feels more suited for spring/summer?) I wouldn't recommend if you are sensitive or picky with scents though- its pretty strong and does linger a bit. I probably wont repurchase it since it was more pricey than other equivalents I have- but it's definitely a good product!"
147,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"First time using a hair mask, next time I'll properly section my hair when using it. But nevertheless, it works really well as deep conditioning. I've probably mentioned the smell in most of my reviews already but it's just....so good! To really get good results, don't be afraid to use A LOT of the product."
148,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Profumo gradevole, ma va via una volta sciacquata.

149,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I have coarse curly hair and this worked really well for me. I recently stopped straightening my hair and my roots grew out dry and curly. I have to say that this saved my roots.

Ziemlich ergiebig, auch für wellige Haare gut geeignet (ich habe 2b-2c Wellen), allerdings darf ich sie nicht zu oft verwenden um die Haare nicht zu beschweren - alle 2-3 Wochen sind bei mir optimal.

0,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces and Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,ATTENTION!!!,"If you are using this and it's making your hair feel dry and dull, IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPERIENCEING PROTEIN OVERLOAD ON YOUR HAIR!!The leave in conditioner smells good and it works. A little bit goes a long way on wet hair and works well to detangle. I wouldn't recommend using it on dry hair.The wash isnt meant to lather alot. NO or LOW LATHER DOES NOT MEAN IT ISNT DOING IT'S JOB!! Non/low-lathering shampoo is different because it requires you to do all the work. YOU scrub and massage your scalp. That's what happens when you go for a sulfate free low lather shampoo. Second, never try to detangle hair with a ""shampoo"" product unless it is a co-wash.Make sure your hair if thoroughly saturated with water before you put in the wash. It helps soften the dirt, oil, and sebum on your scalp. Scrub and massage with the pads of your fingers!"
1,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces and Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not sure this is the real thing,I've used & like Blueberry Bliss.  I've gotten from other distributors in the past.  The time its different. It lathers up and my hair is harder to comb out that if I didn't use it at all.  I comb my hair out in the shower with the conditioner on.  This is definitely not the same as the first few bottles I've had.
2,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces and Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Blissful,"The shampoo did not lather at all, and my hair did not feel remotely clean after using it...in fact I couldn't really tell if I rinsed it all out of my hair or not. The conditioner was so-so, but I felt like it wasn't very effective after having used the shampoo. I was really excited to try this leave-in, but after the experience I had I couldn't wait to just rinse it out like normal conditioner. I was also not pleased with the smell either...I read a lot of reviews about this product, and thought it would smell wonderful, but I really don't know what all the fuss is about. It smelled like something was off about this...almost like it was either old, or the formula had been tampered with in some way. The whole experience was not blissful at all, and I ended up having a bad hair day (finally just threw my hair in a ponytail and called it a day). I can't wait to wash this out of my hair with a product that I know gets the job done."
3,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces and Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,"This stuff smells yummy, but that’s all it’s got going for it. My hair is a 2C & it’s fine. It makes it frizzy & feels really dry. There was no control at all! I used it in combination with the blueberry bliss control gel. My hair felt even finer & looked terrible. Like all products it takes time so I kept trying. Finally defeated I went back to my previous products & It took a week for my hair to look & feel healthy."
4,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Wash, 8 Ounces and Reparative Leave In Conditioner, 8 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Almost what I wanted,"Unfortunately, this shampoo and conditioner was not as effective as I had hoped. It didn't seem to lather much when I used it, and did not leave my hair with any more body or shine than any of the 3.00 shampoo's on the market. Afterwards, I read the directions (who reads the directions on shampoo?) and it says to wash with it, then separate your hair into different bunches and shampoo them individually, and let it set a little before rinsing. Way too much work for a shampoo, but I tried it their way. Still not the results that you would expect from the claims and the price. I gave it three stars because it does work, just not to the degree they say. I won't buy this again."

My hair is normally so dry in the back of my head when I wake up in the morning.  I love the fact that the product does not produce a lot of latter which is a sign that the product is natural and healthy for your hair.

I use it alone if just going for very soft large curls. I still have frizz but it's enough for the grocery store and gym. I usually scrunch this into my wet hair and then use a gel (currently using Aveda Confixor gel). It creates a moisturizing base that doesn't leave my hair greasy in the least. I have fine hair and 3b curl type.

   It usnot yhe product I'm having problems with.  UPS delivered the package  with one of the bottle cap loose and the oil spilled into bag.  Which had the other items saturated with oil."
1,"Curls Blueberry Hair and Scalp Oil, 4 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ineffective method of shrink packaging,I like the product but the oil was not effectively sealed.

0,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not recommend,I was so excited to try this product but was so disappointed. Wanted something to deep condition and moisturize my curls.  All this did was dry it out terribly. Regretfully i purchased a 2 pack.  DO NOT RECOMMEND. So disappointed with results wanted to return  I went on their website and discovered if you are dissatisfied with product you get a credit for another product verses a refund. :(
1,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Deep Conditioner,"This is a very moisturizing deep conditioner. The scent is bright and pleasing but might be overwhelming to anyone who is sensitive to strong fragrance. It is slightly expensive and has become impossible to find in stores which is unfortunate.  The price is similar to comparable products but slightly expensive, especially when you have to pay additional shipping costs."
2,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Delicious!,"My hair is extremely dry, and I am always on the lookout for that miracle product that will ACTUALLY moisturize my hair and take that dry look away without leaving it greasy. I've only tried this product once so far. It wasn't the miracle I was looking for, but I'm going to continue using it to see if more than one use will improve the condition of my hair. It smells really good and is thick and rich. It contains organic ingredients, but not all the ingredients are organic."
3,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Amazing! Fantastic Conditioning Mask!,"I tried this on my hair this evening and it's absolutely incredible. It's smells like fresh blueberries, has a thick consistency (see photo), and definitely soften and detangles curls. Now, whether it helps with growing curls/hair is yet to be seen. I need to use it for longer. But, even if it didn't, it's still a great moisturizing mask that helps condition and hydrate my hair. I love it!"
4,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,My go too deep conditioner,"I love this deep conditioner so much there’s not much else to say. It’s perfect. I have medium porosity, medium density, and medium strand thickness with a mix of curl type that ranges from 2C to 3B but mostly 3A."
5,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Seems worth it,Nice! Very thick and it smells incredible. I’m only one use in so I’ll have to follow up. But the consistency tells me it’s going to do what I want it to do as far as moisture.

I was so excited to try this because the scent was amazing and I was looking for a new hair mask. Well this was a complete waste.

16,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy Hair!,My hair absolutely loves this product!

0,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Stuff,"I already knew that liquid is absorbed quicker than pill form, so after reading customer reviews, I decided to try the Blueberry Bliss.  My hair is noticeably thicker, longer and with less shed.  I've been a loyal customer since before they changed the taste, it's a bit sweeter...to me, BUT it's blueberry, so it's all good !!  It's definitely worth a try and see what it can do for you ~~"
1,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Expired bottles,"I purchases this set of vitamins on April 12, 2020. I consumed one bottle in 2 weeks, but I had noticed it had a pungent taste. I just assumed that they may have changed the formula to make it more potent. I even started to dilute it with as it was to be bitter to drink it straight. Today I was about to open the 2nd bottl, and I noticed the expiration date was January 1, 2020. It's May 5, 2020 today, so I drank a whole bottle that was expired. I just discarded the 2nd bottle that I never opened. I'm really disgusted and disappointed. These vitamins  are pricey. I will caution other buyers to check the dates on the bottle and becareful buying online."
2,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very effective,"I have been using this product for more than 6 months.  I suffer from alopecia and I also have a number of health issues that affect my hair growth, I also stress easily.  I have tried a number of products and remedies.  Honestly, you need patience especially if you have similar issues.  My hair has grown a lot over the months that I've been using the product but the areas that I have bald spots don't grow in as fast but like I said, you need patience.  Overall the product works for hair growth it just works a bit slower for my bald spots.  The taste is very pleasant and so I have no problem reording one one bottle gets done :-)"
3,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible acrid taste and smell,I have ordered these for the last year and though the taste wasn't great it was manageable and it seemed to be helping my hair. But the order I placed in May 2020 was unlike the rest. It was awful. I wish I had read the earlier review to check the date. I usually drank it straight but I took one sip and my stomach immediately began to burn and was upset the rest of the day. Even Mylanta didn't help. I returned both bottles. It never occurred to me to check the expiration but it did cross my mind that it was possibly an old batch or contaminated somehow. That's how bad it was. I'm really scared to order again at the risk of wasting my money.
4,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not purchase from here,I purchased two bottles in April and just started on the second bottle and it is green. The first bottle was not this color as I use this product frequently and usually purchase from Target. I contacted manufacture and they stated it should not be green. I am not able to return on Amazon because the window closed 30 days after purchasing so I wasted money for a product I can use.
5,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great solution for those who don't like pill form supplements,I have been using this product for a few days now with no issues; I normally get skin flare ups when o take biotin.

27,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Blue Liquid Gold,I love this product!! What I appreciate about a vitamin in liquid form is that it is easier to absorb and I do not have to swallow a large pill. I have noticed significant positive changes in hair growth as well as my skin. You have to be realistic with any type of hair vitamin. You will not see results overnight. I had to take this vitamin consistently for two months until I started seeing any progress. I cut off almost 5 inches of my curls back in January and it’s pretty much grown back thanks to these vitamins. I will continue to purchase these vitamins since they have had a positive effect on me as compared to other vitamins I have taken over the years.

One thing is that it doesn’t just grow the hair on your head but hair on your body in general, so keep a razor handy! I will be repurchasing as soon as I finish my bottle! So happy!"
31,"Curls Blueberry Liquid Hair Vitamin, 8 Ounces (Pack of 2)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Poisonous,Product is poisonous. No decent warning. After a week the tree nuts in it caused annafalectic shock. Medical pros never heard of having to read small small print for allergen in a vitamin. Thanks
