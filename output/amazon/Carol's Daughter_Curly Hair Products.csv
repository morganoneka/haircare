   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"
1,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"I have thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and this product didnt do anything for me. It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."
3,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,1 product  Serious curl definition,Very great product for naturals the best I’ve ever tried.
4,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,It worked! I have bouncy curls now!,"I never thought I could just let my curls air dry and be done, but with this hair mask that is very much possible! I’m so happy with my purchase! I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"
5,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,ZERO STARS - WORST. SMELL. EVER. And no way to get it out of hair.,I shampooed my hair six times with anothe product and cannot get this horrific smell out of my hair. God help me.
6,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."
7,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Day 1 styling,"Love the hold, definition, and shine it adds to my hair on day 1. If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."
8,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This is now my favorite product. It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."
9,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite hair mask (type 3c/4a/4b hair),"The hair mask is AMAZING... im not a fan of the smell and it does linger in your hair (reminds me of the Aveeno lavender baby lotion) ... BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."
10,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,This actually works !,"So I have the worst dry hair. Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."
11,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,HOLY GRAIL HAIR PRODUCT,"THE HOLY GRAIL CURLY HAIR PRODUCT, PPL!!Everyone go buy this - and then go back and buy it again for anyone you love. This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."
13,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",2.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but didn’t deliver,"I am trying to find something less expensive than Kinky Curls custard. Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."
14,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product.,I have issues with odors ; My friends know not to come around me with smelly ( perfumes soaps deodorant etc.)  this has a nice clean smell and does not linger.
15,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."
17,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells amazing, great hold and shine","This stuff is great! I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"
18,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Coco Creme EXCELLENT Product!,I love Carols Daughter products and was happy to see the launch of the Coco Creme line.  I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.
22,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best find for my kinky curls, after 40 years of searching!","I had stopped buying products since nothing seemed to work for my kinky, white-girl curls. I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"
23,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only Carol's Daughter Product I use,"I've purchased Carol's Daughter products in the past and many of them were average, for me.  Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."
25,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous,Been using this product for years Never leave home without it!
26,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",2.0 out of 5 stars,Left My Hair Dry & brittle,"After first applying Carol's Daughter Coco Creme to my damp hair I could feel my hair turning hard.  I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."
27,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,My Favorite Hair Mask,"I love this deep moisture hair mask for my dry/damaged curly hair. I apply this to my hair every time I wash it, which is usually 2-3 times a week. I leave it on for at least 5 minutes to really moisturize my hair. I love the smell and it makes my hair soft, silky and shiny."
28,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,All that your curls need!!!,"Just amazing!!!!! I've been looking for something like this for so long and I finally found it. This leave in conditioner is perfect for my curls, it softens and moisturizes my hair and the smell  OMG just divine!!! I'm proudly going to say that this is my new creme and I will be trying more of their other products for sure."
29,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."
30,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like old spice, but my hair feels great!","I’ve used the original hair milk in the past and really liked it, so I decided to try the coco creme hair mask.This does not smell like coco or cream or any combination of the two. The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."
31,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rinse Out Type of Hair Mask,"Some of these reviews people been talking about how it doesn't make their hair curl talking like they think it's a leave in conditioner cream. This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."
32,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Winner Hair Gel,I have been trying so many curly hair gel products after mine was discontinued and this one is it! It goes in smoothly. My hair doesn't feel crunchy but looks and feels soft without the frizz. What sold me is my hair doesn't feel gross and tangled when I take a shower after using it. So glad I found a replacement product. Winner
33,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product! Super dry hair problem solved in first use.,"Since my hair started going gray it has become unmanageable and I’ve been struggling to figure out how to care for it. It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

Goodbye hair spray.,"My curls are so happy! After using Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo and conditioner I used this styling butter. This was the only product I used and there's absolutely no frizz! Very thick butter so a little goes a long way. I pat my finger tips onto the butter and rub into my fingers, and then through my hair. I am a fan!"

When properly moisturized, he has a head full of big gorgeous curls.  Finding the right product for him has been difficult.  So happy to have taken a chance on this mask after reading reviews.

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or this is just a bad batch but it’s horrible."

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips. Then I did the same thing at my roots surrounding my face. But the greatest thing was that I didn't habe ti do or add anything else to get defined curls and waves. This is my new go-to. I also bought the conditioner and I am buying the shampoo next."
40,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft and curly.,"I'm still feeling this out but I think I like it.  I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming. The intensity of the chemical smell plus coconut  did reduced overnight but not enough. To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

Hair is soft when using this. I’ve used this a month now in addition to other products because I don’t like my hair poofy. 1 jar does last me a month with every day use, a little goes a long way with this product. 4 stars because of the price and I can’t give 4.5."

My hair went from mostly moisturized to frizzy, DRY (it actually began to crackle and break), my curl pattern became kinky instead of spirals. This isn't for dry hair. This isn't for anybody's hair, really."

I have 4c low porosity hair, and I used the Cantu leave-in before this one and it worked well for me but I wanted to find a moisturizer that is black-owned and works just as well. Guess I'll keep looking cuz this one ain't it."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.  I will also be trying the Coco Crème shampoo and conditioner."

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

I can even use it without a conditioner(I try not to!), and it still tames everything down.For me it's worth it, and I hope they never stop making it.  I don't want to keep adding to my reject pile of shampoo bottles if they did!"

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

Its very moisturizing my looked amazing after i used it. But Oh. My. Gosh. The smell is infuriating it gave me horrible headaches and lasted for days. I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

It isn't overpowering once you wash it all off but when you have it on it feels excessive. I use it about once a week or every two weeks and I really don't find much of a difference in my hair, it gives *some* moisturization but I prefer other masks I've tried."

It's soft- it makes my hair Softer and it's super Moisturizering. For anyone like me who doesn't know what to use on your hair, go to a natural hair salon and get a hair consultation. They're usual free. It's okay to ask a professional. And there is a difference between this - a pudding- the hair Milk (also a great product) a cream."

Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

620,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."
627,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,"This conditioner is supposed to be helpful for ""extremely dry hair,"" which is not the case for me--mine tends toward oily.  But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

645,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

651,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while.

I really like this company. I love that their products, like this one, has NO silicones, parabens, petroleum, mineral oil or artificial colors.  I find the fragrance of this one to be light and refreshing overall. Not overpowering for a man and I believe lots of women will also enjoy it.  Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.  I honestly have received and reviewed many different shampoo and conditioner products from different companies. Carols daughter is one of my favorite. This is a company I would buy from again."

With out reading it I assumed it was a body moisture, so I applied it to my legs, hands, and arms. I LOVE IT. It should be for your body too. At first it seemed greasy. But as it drys your skin feels awesome. When I googled where to buy, is when I discovered it was for your hair. WHAT A LAUGH I HAD. Sorry but I'm going to use it all over. It's great. I give it a 10 for sure. If I made you smile or laugh too. Your welcome.  :) Pam"

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."
658,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deeply hydrating,"The summer humidity had left my curls feeling dry and frizzy, and my normal cowash routine seemed to get longer everyday as my regular conditioner no longer had the same slip so I was more than excited to try this conditioner. First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

But I love the product so much that I can put up with the smell. I put a good amount of gel on my wet hair as it is long and curly. It sure is gel...slimy and all. But it works. I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

Was hoping this would be perfect for my hair, but when it arrived I realized how strong it smelled....If you read the ingredients list, ""Parfum (Fragrance)"" is surprisingly high up on the list (appears before the stabilizers and all the good fruit extracts), and you can really tell. This stuff has a very strong, sharp artificial scent that, for me, is a total turn off. I'm sensitive to strong fragrances and won't be able to use this at all. So bummed!"

I have super dry, thick, frizzy hair and it works great. I was so glad to finally try their sulfate-free shampoo too. I have been using Deva-Curl NoPoo Shampoo and it works great, but I like to change up my shampoo and not use the same one all the time. This Coco Creme Shampoo feels like it cleans my hair, but doesn’t dry it out at all. I only wash my hair about twice a week, so this bottle lasts a long time for me. You only really need one squirt for medium length hair. Smells great too! Love it!"

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

Even after just one use you can see and feel the results. My hair looks so healthy and has a shine that it didn’t before. This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

My hair is so naturally dry I don't even rinse the conditioner out; I just gently work the conditioner down to my ends and squeeze out the conditioner with the excess water. This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo. The pump is handy. I prefer for my conditioner to have a pump so I can measure each time I use it (3 pumps). I don't know who Carol is or her daughter, but they make some pretty good hair products for curly hair."

The smell of this mask is amazing.  It has a sweet, coconut fragrance that lingers long after rinsing the product out of your hair.  The mask itself is very thick and silky feeling and absorbs quickly into the hair.  Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.  Every time I have used this mask, it has left my hair feeling nourished and smooth.  It also brings a bit of shine back to my hair.  Great product that is made in the USA."

Rhassoul Clay

   shampoo and conditioner for months now, and I really like those.  This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent.

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly. Carol’s Daughter has become by far my favorite line of shampoos and conditioners."

As it has thickened it gets so dried out if she does not condition and wash it everyday. I don't think hair should be washed that often. I wanted something that would help. She has been using this for a couple weeks and I have noticed a softening. It has a coconut, vanilla scent that just smells amazing. I wish it had more natural ingredients, you shouldn't have to pay a price like this for an ingredient list like that. It is nice and thick and lathers well and is ok for color treated hair."

But don’t hold that against the company! If you have dry, damaged, processed hair, this conditioner is a lifesaver. It is probably one of the only hair products I’ve used that has resulted in a visible improvement in my hair. I have long highlighted hair which has never been the healthiest from years of color. Using this conditioner regularly for the past few weeks has made my hair look healthier and shinier. Even the ends (currently way overdue for a trim) are less split. And it smells like heaven!

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours. So the idea of a moisturize and conditioner in one was enticing. But the problem with this product is that it contains alcohol, and that, as most people know, dries your hair. So it is counter intuitive... the benefits of the coconut oil get erased by the drying factor of the alcohol. Oh well."

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.) My thick, curly hair absorbed it well enough, though the product is a bit thin. My hair, once dry, looks nice, but I have difficulty with the wet comb-through.  With a conditioner that works well, I can comb my wet hair easily.  So this product is a bit of a disappointment."

Some, like this conditioner, I like less than others.My hope was for a light cocoa butter-ish smell and that it would work for my daughter's leaning-toward-oily hair. Sadly, the scent is very strong and sickeningly sweet (I do have sensitive sinuses) while it enhances the oiliness of her hair. She only used it a few times before we had to stop. I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

This coco creme shampoo lives up to its name. I washed my hair in it and to be honest, I was worried that it would be troublesome to wash out the shampoo. This is the creamiest shampoo I have ever used. It lathered so much from just a dash of shampoo.I love the fragrance.I didn't need to worry, the shampoo washed out just like any other shampoo, and it left a lovely scent."

After big chopping in '15, I used the black vanilla shampoo conditioner combo and it was a great addition to my hair regime to help it grow back quickly. I loved the smell of the black vanilla, but this coco creme is even better. Same great moisture and slippage even with my hard water situation out here in the desert."

Factor in the drying air of winter and my hair looks and feels like straw. Lightly fragranced, this shampoo lathers richly and rinses cleanly. It is moisturizing and leaves hair feeling healthy and soft. I would not use if hair is oily. Nor would I use it everyday. But it does ease dryness and make hair look and feel touchable."

But when I applied it, the lather was so rich and luxurious that I realized a little goes a very long way.  And the result?  My hair looks and feels nice.  This is something I think I could use every day and not have my hair turn into straw."

It rinses out well, but that lingering coconut perfume does linger a bit.  It's a good mask, though, and I'm going to continue to use it until it's gone."

I'll stick with my current washout conditioner and use the leave-in version to add extra moisture."
708,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thick, luxurious, moisturizing coco butter shampoo is wonderful! First, I needed only a small amount, much less than I usually must use, when I shampooed my very long hair. This shampoo suds up easily and cleans as it moisturizes. After I used it, my hair was ultra-soft and tangle free. This shampoo contains no sulfates, parabens or artificial colors. It does contain coconut oil, milk, murumuru and mango butters, which hydrate and nourish the hair. It has a light and refreshing coconut scent. In addition, this wonderful shampoo comes in any easy-to-use pump bottle for your convenience. It is fairly priced for an excellent, concentrated shampoo.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."

773,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR 4C HAIR,"At first I thought this would be another hair fail. I have 4C hair, and there are so many products that promise to be compatible that aren't, all they do is dry you hair out, and sit on top of it making it gritty and harder to manage. I have low porosity hair, and most products just don't work for me. I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."
774,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for 4c hair!,I purchased this product along with the curl enhancing moisture cream for my daughter who has 4c hair. It did not work for her hair at all see pics(last two) however for my hair it did great! I have 4a/4b hair. It defined my curls perfectly! The moisture was disappointing especially since this product is supposed to be for very dry hair; It was just ok. Overall I will not be purchasing it again for my daughter but MAY buy it for myself. If you have 4c hair save your money!
775,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,I get so many compliments on my hair,"So far I am please with this conditioner and the shampoo.  I have tried so many different products since I've gone natural about 8 yrs ago. I do not have natural curls,  therefore I need to moisturized my hair to bring the curls out. I've consistently been using this and I'm please. I use a different brand after shampoo and conditioner called leave in or rinse out conditioner by Shea Martin."

827,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dry after effect on hair,It has a good slip and gave good curl definition .

828,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST CONDITIONER,"This has been by far the best conditioner I have ever tried. I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"
1,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"I have thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and this product didnt do anything for me. It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I have bouncy curls now!,"I never thought I could just let my curls air dry and be done, but with this hair mask that is very much possible! I’m so happy with my purchase! I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"

SMELL. EVER. And no way to get it out of hair.,I shampooed my hair six times with anothe product and cannot get this horrific smell out of my hair. God help me.
6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."

If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."

It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."

BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."

Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but didn’t deliver,"I am trying to find something less expensive than Kinky Curls custard. Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."

15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."

I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"
18,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Coco Creme EXCELLENT Product!,I love Carols Daughter products and was happy to see the launch of the Coco Creme line.  I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.

I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"
23,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only Carol's Daughter Product I use,"I've purchased Carol's Daughter products in the past and many of them were average, for me.  Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."

I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."

I apply this to my hair every time I wash it, which is usually 2-3 times a week. I leave it on for at least 5 minutes to really moisturize my hair. I love the smell and it makes my hair soft, silky and shiny."

I've been looking for something like this for so long and I finally found it. This leave in conditioner is perfect for my curls, it softens and moisturizes my hair and the smell  OMG just divine!!! I'm proudly going to say that this is my new creme and I will be trying more of their other products for sure."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."
30,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like old spice, but my hair feels great!","I’ve used the original hair milk in the past and really liked it, so I decided to try the coco creme hair mask.This does not smell like coco or cream or any combination of the two. The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."
31,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rinse Out Type of Hair Mask,"Some of these reviews people been talking about how it doesn't make their hair curl talking like they think it's a leave in conditioner cream. This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

So glad I found a replacement product. Winner

Super dry hair problem solved in first use.,"Since my hair started going gray it has become unmanageable and I’ve been struggling to figure out how to care for it. It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or this is just a bad batch but it’s horrible."

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips.

I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming.

To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

I have 4c low porosity hair, and I used the Cantu leave-in before this one and it worked well for me but I wanted to find a moisturizer that is black-owned and works just as well. Guess I'll keep looking cuz this one ain't it."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.  I will also be trying the Coco Crème shampoo and conditioner."

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

I can even use it without a conditioner(I try not to!), and it still tames everything down.For me it's worth it, and I hope they never stop making it.  I don't want to keep adding to my reject pile of shampoo bottles if they did!"

Smells amazing, super easy to distribute evenly through hair and really nice hold but still feels soft to the touch. Unfortunately the package I received this time was severely damaged and there was no gel in the container because it spilled all over the box. Box was wrapped in plastic but soaked in gel. Will update my review when new product arrives."
55,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous on my 2C hair!,"Oh how I love this stuff. The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

58,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I’ve found for dry thin ringlets,"I’ve tried so many curl products for my daughters soft, thin and very dry ringlets. Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

After purchasing and wasting money on products that claim to work on “very dry” hair,  I brought carol’s daughter thinking it would solve my problem.  This product breaks my hair.  It contains mineral oil.  And it’s a cream not a paste.  My hair has to be wet."

Its very moisturizing my looked amazing after i used it. But Oh. My. Gosh. The smell is infuriating it gave me horrible headaches and lasted for days. I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

While most gels leave your hair crunchy, heavy, and frizzy, this product left my hair light-weight, soft, and the best it has ever looked. Had this product for a while and still only used half the container. Definitely would buy again."

It isn't overpowering once you wash it all off but when you have it on it feels excessive. I use it about once a week or every two weeks and I really don't find much of a difference in my hair, it gives *some* moisturization but I prefer other masks I've tried."

The consistency of this product was not what I expected. it was very close to a dippity do, too gelly for me and didn't help my curls. It was nice for making my hair kind of silky."
67,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I use most her products anyways and this one works as well.,"Love the scent. It's soft- it makes my hair Softer and it's super Moisturizering. For anyone like me who doesn't know what to use on your hair, go to a natural hair salon and get a hair consultation. They're usual free. It's okay to ask a professional. And there is a difference between this - a pudding- the hair Milk (also a great product) a cream."

69,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great.,It’s one of my favorite hair products. It works great as a hair mask and leave in conditioner because it deeply hydrates and defines my hair but it irritates my scalp a little and makes it itch. I still enjoy this product though and I would recommend it to everyone with natural hair.

The top has been wiped down like it was once sticky. Not sure if it’s safe to use or if it was tampered with. I read the reviews that it doesn’t come with an additional seal, but it would have been helpful in this instance to know if it was tampers with."

My kid had 4c hair and the average moisturizers don't work for his hair type. This worked like a charm. His hair was soft, moisturized, and it smelled so good. Another plus was the shipping time."

I smell like I just stepped out of the beauty salon and not necessarily in a good way. I can literally taste the cloud of fragrance hanging around my hair. It's too much & that really sucks cuz my curls do look better.Update: after day 4 I had to throw the rest away. The fragrance made me so nauseous I almost ralphed after my shower. Never again."

I've purchased several of this product line. It smells wonderful, feels great on my hair and great for styling.

I cannot use products that contain a lot of oil.  It will just sit on my hair and take away  any natural wave or curl.  My hair responds to products that have more water.  This product works well with my hair texture.  I just wet my hair, massage into the scalp and ends and style."

She has coppery corkscrew curls... with the right product.This product is the only product in 13 years that ‘consistently’ detangles her curls and keeps them bouncy. We’ve tried everything from kerastase to Unite to Mixed Chics. Most work for a little while but eventually weigh her curls down, leave her frizzy or just crunchy. Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

It cleans my scalp Without stripping my hair and it smells amazing. A surprisingly small amount spreads all over my hair and has good slip with a silky lather.

620,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."
627,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,"This conditioner is supposed to be helpful for ""extremely dry hair,"" which is not the case for me--mine tends toward oily.  But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."
628,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thick, coarse, dry, wavy/curly, highlighted hair.  I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."
629,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this curl gel! I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."
631,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I love this! It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I have to say that it worked fantastically.  I used it every day after I got back from the beach or pool, and my hair has stayed soft and pliable.  No noticeable sun, salt or chlorine damage.  I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It kept them defined and smelling good all day. Haven’t noticed any flaking. However, if you use a lot in one section, the curls have like a firm-crisp feeling, but not crunchy, just firm. It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

This one is heavenly!  When you have curls, you don't want heavy products.  This mist smells amazing.  I love how lightweight it is.  I sprayed this on my clean hair, once while damp and again while dry.  My curls were not sticky or stiff, but shiny and smooth.  While I do not have very dry hair, I felt that this mist added a nice amount of hydration to my hair.  I will definitely use this as a refresher for my curls on days that I do not wash my hair.

645,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

The scent of the product is amazing it smells really good. The gel is light weight and does not weigh down hair. The gel cream is a little tacky or sticky when applying but that feeling goes away. I use this product on my natural hair and my weaves and it works well. Also I love the size of the jar you get a lot of product to last you a little while depending on how much you apply.

While I still have frizz, I feel like I'm able to have more days where my hair is down versus it being up in a bun or in a ponytail. I love the smell of the spray and I also like how much product is in the bottle. I'm able to use this to refresh my hair throughout the week or for what I need additional moisture added to my hair. I would definitely get this again because of how much I've been enjoying my curls. I also like how long the mist is when dispensing the product into my hair; one spritz goes a long way."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

I have a 3c/4a hair type and I like to use after I apply my products. i don’t section I just spray right on top and where I feel I need it but mostly focusing on the roots and ends. I even like to apply it at the end of the day after I take it out of my protective styles. It helps aid in my dryness. It takes my curls to a new level of definition making them less frizzy and last longer in my wash and go process. I would love to try more from this line!
651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

But I love the product so much that I can put up with the smell. I put a good amount of gel on my wet hair as it is long and curly. It sure is gel...slimy and all. But it works. I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

Was hoping this would be perfect for my hair, but when it arrived I realized how strong it smelled....If you read the ingredients list, ""Parfum (Fragrance)"" is surprisingly high up on the list (appears before the stabilizers and all the good fruit extracts), and you can really tell. This stuff has a very strong, sharp artificial scent that, for me, is a total turn off. I'm sensitive to strong fragrances and won't be able to use this at all. So bummed!"

I have super dry, thick, frizzy hair and it works great. I was so glad to finally try their sulfate-free shampoo too. I have been using Deva-Curl NoPoo Shampoo and it works great, but I like to change up my shampoo and not use the same one all the time. This Coco Creme Shampoo feels like it cleans my hair, but doesn’t dry it out at all. I only wash my hair about twice a week, so this bottle lasts a long time for me. You only really need one squirt for medium length hair. Smells great too! Love it!"

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

I don’t have very curly hair so I need product to make the curls happen. I love the smell of this — kind of like coconut.

I have several other products by Carol’s Daughter and they all work really well and are made with ingredients that don’t hurt my hair or dry it out."

Even after just one use you can see and feel the results. My hair looks so healthy and has a shine that it didn’t before. This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

My hair is so naturally dry I don't even rinse the conditioner out; I just gently work the conditioner down to my ends and squeeze out the conditioner with the excess water. This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo. The pump is handy. I prefer for my conditioner to have a pump so I can measure each time I use it (3 pumps). I don't know who Carol is or her daughter, but they make some pretty good hair products for curly hair."

The smell of this mask is amazing.  It has a sweet, coconut fragrance that lingers long after rinsing the product out of your hair.  The mask itself is very thick and silky feeling and absorbs quickly into the hair.  Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.  Every time I have used this mask, it has left my hair feeling nourished and smooth.  It also brings a bit of shine back to my hair.  Great product that is made in the USA."

From what I’ve seen ,for real results without any frizz coming out of your moisturized curls you gotta put in the work ladies! Finger curl each strand for the best results!

Rhassoul Clay

   shampoo and conditioner for months now, and I really like those.  This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

This Carol's Daughter hair mask worked well for me. It is intended to be used as a weekly treatment, which is what I have been doing for the past month. The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent.

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly. Carol’s Daughter has become by far my favorite line of shampoos and conditioners."

As it has thickened it gets so dried out if she does not condition and wash it everyday. I don't think hair should be washed that often. I wanted something that would help. She has been using this for a couple weeks and I have noticed a softening. It has a coconut, vanilla scent that just smells amazing. I wish it had more natural ingredients, you shouldn't have to pay a price like this for an ingredient list like that. It is nice and thick and lathers well and is ok for color treated hair."

But don’t hold that against the company! If you have dry, damaged, processed hair, this conditioner is a lifesaver. It is probably one of the only hair products I’ve used that has resulted in a visible improvement in my hair. I have long highlighted hair which has never been the healthiest from years of color. Using this conditioner regularly for the past few weeks has made my hair look healthier and shinier. Even the ends (currently way overdue for a trim) are less split. And it smells like heaven!

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours. So the idea of a moisturize and conditioner in one was enticing. But the problem with this product is that it contains alcohol, and that, as most people know, dries your hair. So it is counter intuitive... the benefits of the coconut oil get erased by the drying factor of the alcohol. Oh well."

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.) My thick, curly hair absorbed it well enough, though the product is a bit thin. My hair, once dry, looks nice, but I have difficulty with the wet comb-through.  With a conditioner that works well, I can comb my wet hair easily.  So this product is a bit of a disappointment."

Some, like this conditioner, I like less than others.My hope was for a light cocoa butter-ish smell and that it would work for my daughter's leaning-toward-oily hair. Sadly, the scent is very strong and sickeningly sweet (I do have sensitive sinuses) while it enhances the oiliness of her hair. She only used it a few times before we had to stop. I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

Love the pump dispenser.  I really don't notice my hair being any different using this product than other conditioners I've tried.

First, I needed only a small amount, much less than I usually must use, when I shampooed my very long hair. This shampoo suds up easily and cleans as it moisturizes. After I used it, my hair was ultra-soft and tangle free. This shampoo contains no sulfates, parabens or artificial colors. It does contain coconut oil, milk, murumuru and mango butters, which hydrate and nourish the hair. It has a light and refreshing coconut scent. In addition, this wonderful shampoo comes in any easy-to-use pump bottle for your convenience. It is fairly priced for an excellent, concentrated shampoo.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."

778,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Naturally Lovely in all the right places.,"I love this stuff it smells great and is not greasy, makes my hair incredibly soft, I still need to use a pomade or setting creme to hold the locks from frazzling but its truly lovely stuff. Makes my scalp feel nourished as well."

780,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Working great,Ideally I was hoping to find a fully vegan shampoo for curly hair but since I've had a good experience with the Carol's daughter hair honey I thought I'd give this a shot and it does seem to give my hair some needed moisturization and others have said my hair looks more voluptuous so guess it's a keeper.

826,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy with this product,This butter leaves my hair stiff and it leaves a residue in my hair which makes my hair look dirty as if I have uncontrollable dandruff.
827,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dry after effect on hair,It has a good slip and gave good curl definition . But after I crunch out the cast it leaves my hair feeling dry not soft. I did try using less. But still get the dry texture. Not for me. 🙃😕
828,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST CONDITIONER,"This has been by far the best conditioner I have ever tried. I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

831,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Seems used
832,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,The product is good but I can't stand the smell,The product is a nice consistency and holds my curls well but the smell is extremely strong and reminds me of axe body spray or some other men's cologne.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

This and the Monoi Carol’s Daughter masks are really good. Don’t get the almond one though. It’s thick, and it makes your hair silky!

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"

It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"

6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."

If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."

It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."
9,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite hair mask (type 3c/4a/4b hair),"The hair mask is AMAZING... im not a fan of the smell and it does linger in your hair (reminds me of the Aveeno lavender baby lotion) ... BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."

Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great.

You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."

Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."

I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.

I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."

I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"

I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."

I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.

I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"

Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."

The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."

I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."

29,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."

The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."
31,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rinse Out Type of Hair Mask,"Some of these reviews people been talking about how it doesn't make their hair curl talking like they think it's a leave in conditioner cream. This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it.

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips.

I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

I can even use it without a conditioner(I try not to!), and it still tames everything down.For me it's worth it, and I hope they never stop making it.  I don't want to keep adding to my reject pile of shampoo bottles if they did!"

Smells amazing, super easy to distribute evenly through hair and really nice hold but still feels soft to the touch.

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

After purchasing and wasting money on products that claim to work on “very dry” hair,  I brought carol’s daughter thinking it would solve my problem.  This product breaks my hair.

Its very moisturizing my looked amazing after i used it. But Oh. My. Gosh. The smell is infuriating it gave me horrible headaches and lasted for days. I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

It isn't overpowering once you wash it all off but when you have it on it feels excessive. I use it about once a week or every two weeks and I really don't find much of a difference in my hair, it gives *some* moisturization but I prefer other masks I've tried."

It's soft- it makes my hair Softer and it's super Moisturizering. For anyone like me who doesn't know what to use on your hair, go to a natural hair salon and get a hair consultation. They're usual free. It's okay to ask a professional. And there is a difference between this - a pudding- the hair Milk (also a great product) a cream."

It works great as a hair mask and leave in conditioner because it deeply hydrates and defines my hair but it irritates my scalp a little and makes it itch. I still enjoy this product though and I would recommend it to everyone with natural hair.

My kid had 4c hair and the average moisturizers don't work for his hair type. This worked like a charm. His hair was soft, moisturized, and it smelled so good. Another plus was the shipping time."

She has coppery corkscrew curls... with the right product.This product is the only product in 13 years that ‘consistently’ detangles her curls and keeps them bouncy. We’ve tried everything from kerastase to Unite to Mixed Chics. Most work for a little while but eventually weigh her curls down, leave her frizzy or just crunchy. Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

620,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."

But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

I use this product on my natural hair and my weaves and it works well. Also I love the size of the jar you get a lot of product to last you a little while depending on how much you apply.

While I still have frizz, I feel like I'm able to have more days where my hair is down versus it being up in a bun or in a ponytail. I love the smell of the spray and I also like how much product is in the bottle. I'm able to use this to refresh my hair throughout the week or for what I need additional moisture added to my hair. I would definitely get this again because of how much I've been enjoying my curls. I also like how long the mist is when dispensing the product into my hair; one spritz goes a long way."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

I’ve always been a fan of carols daughter but this was my first time trying this. The smell is very pleasing as well. I have a 3c/4a hair type and I like to use after I apply my products. i don’t section I just spray right on top and where I feel I need it but mostly focusing on the roots and ends. I even like to apply it at the end of the day after I take it out of my protective styles. It helps aid in my dryness. It takes my curls to a new level of definition making them less frizzy and last longer in my wash and go process. I would love to try more from this line!
651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

I really like this company. I love that their products, like this one, has NO silicones, parabens, petroleum, mineral oil or artificial colors.  I find the fragrance of this one to be light and refreshing overall. Not overpowering for a man and I believe lots of women will also enjoy it.  Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.  I honestly have received and reviewed many different shampoo and conditioner products from different companies. Carols daughter is one of my favorite. This is a company I would buy from again."

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

This stuff has a very strong, sharp artificial scent that, for me, is a total turn off. I'm sensitive to strong fragrances and won't be able to use this at all. So bummed!"

I have been using Deva-Curl NoPoo Shampoo and it works great, but I like to change up my shampoo and not use the same one all the time.

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo.

Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.

It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.

Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance.

I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

Nope.  Not dandruff - just an allergic reaction.  So I was happy to see this come up.  Yay!  No scalp scratching, which can be kind of embarrassing when you work somewhere where people consider you family and feel just fine calling you out for scratching your scalp.Ugh!  Don't you just hate that?Right.  Anyway, my hair stays clean for a couple of days, and there's no disgusting scratching.  The price is decent.  It smells good.  Love it!"

It is a fairly thick cream and it rubs into my hair well. It also rinses out thoroughly. The fragrance is kind of strong. It's a pleasant scent and it lingers while my hair is still wet, but it fades once my hair is dry. The container has ample to last a long time. The screw top works well. I can easily unscrew it to get the product I need and it seals again tightly to keep out water from the shower. I use it two or three times a week and it leaves my hair feeling soft and looking healthy."

Love the pump dispenser.  I really don't notice my hair being any different using this product than other conditioners I've tried.  So I'd consider this a solid choice but maybe not something that stands out enough to warrant the current price.  It would take a chemist to decipher the ingredients list to compare this with a three dollar bottle of Suave Professional conditioner and understand how one claims to be better than the other.  Since I'm not a chemist, I'll probably stick with a more budget friendly product."

Very llite and pleasant fragrance.  The richness of the shampoo struck me as most shampoo has a different viscosity and feel.  I decided that I would Not apply a heavier conditioner, as I did the first time [the accompanying conditioner], as it left my hair feeling lame and over processed with residual.  It didn’t irritate my scalp, which I am rather sensitive.  Nice shampoo with a ‘rich’ feel, but go light on the conditi7if you use one."

It is a strong coconut scent that lingers throughout the day.  Even late in the afternoon, I can still smell it on my hair and it makes me smile.  This may be a turnoff for others because it is very strong, but it works for me.  It also doesn't weight down my hair and has enough moisture to get me through the day in my dry climate.  I wish it helped volumize while moisturizing,but I can't have it all."

I have 4C hair, and there are so many products that promise to be compatible that aren't, all they do is dry you hair out, and sit on top of it making it gritty and harder to manage. I have low porosity hair, and most products just don't work for me. I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."

It did not work for her hair at all see pics(last two) however for my hair it did great! I have 4a/4b hair. It defined my curls perfectly! The moisture was disappointing especially since this product is supposed to be for very dry hair; It was just ok. Overall I will not be purchasing it again for my daughter but MAY buy it for myself. If you have 4c hair save your money!

But after I crunch out the cast it leaves my hair feeling dry not soft. I did try using less. But still get the dry texture. Not for me. 🙃😕
828,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST CONDITIONER,"This has been by far the best conditioner I have ever tried. I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"
1,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"I have thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and this product didnt do anything for me. It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"

SMELL. EVER. And no way to get it out of hair.,I shampooed my hair six times with anothe product and cannot get this horrific smell out of my hair. God help me.
6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Day 1 styling,"Love the hold, definition, and shine it adds to my hair on day 1. If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."
8,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This is now my favorite product. It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."
9,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite hair mask (type 3c/4a/4b hair),"The hair mask is AMAZING... im not a fan of the smell and it does linger in your hair (reminds me of the Aveeno lavender baby lotion) ... BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."

Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but didn’t deliver,"I am trying to find something less expensive than Kinky Curls custard. Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."

15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."

I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"
18,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Coco Creme EXCELLENT Product!,I love Carols Daughter products and was happy to see the launch of the Coco Creme line.  I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.

I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"

Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."

I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."

The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."

The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."

This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

Super dry hair problem solved in first use.,"Since my hair started going gray it has become unmanageable and I’ve been struggling to figure out how to care for it. It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it.

I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

620,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"

They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."

But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I have to say that it worked fantastically.  I used it every day after I got back from the beach or pool, and my hair has stayed soft and pliable.  No noticeable sun, salt or chlorine damage.  I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product.

It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

I’ve always been a fan of carols daughter but this was my first time trying this. The smell is very pleasing as well. I have a 3c/4a hair type and I like to use after I apply my products. i don’t section I just spray right on top and where I feel I need it but mostly focusing on the roots and ends. I even like to apply it at the end of the day after I take it out of my protective styles. It helps aid in my dryness. It takes my curls to a new level of definition making them less frizzy and last longer in my wash and go process. I would love to try more from this line!
651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.

But as it drys your skin feels awesome. When I googled where to buy, is when I discovered it was for your hair. WHAT A LAUGH I HAD. Sorry but I'm going to use it all over. It's great.

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo.

It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.

While in the process of moving from my house to a condo, I was staying at my parents and using drugstore shampoos for a week and when I went to this Carols Daughter shampoo, the different was UNBELIEVABLE.  I highly recommend.  Try it for yourself."

It’s difficult for me to find conditioners that smooth but are lightweight enough not to weigh it down. This conditioner is just right. It leaves my hair soft and untangled but still bouncy and curly. This pump dispenser is a big improvement over their old twist-top bottles and makes it easy to measure the amount I need. I think I’m a convert for life!"

I’m reminded of summer and the beach.  I have baby fine hair and can’t always use conditioners.  It left my hair manageable not lank.  The hot dry summer can really dry out my hair but I found that this acted like a moisturizer.It has none of the bas stuff that can damage your hair (and even your scalp).  No Silicones, No Parabens, No Petrolatum, No Mineral Oil, No Artificial Colors  It’s just a real nice treatment to use after you shampoo and makes your hair feel good – and look good."

Very llite and pleasant fragrance.  The richness of the shampoo struck me as most shampoo has a different viscosity and feel.  I decided that I would Not apply a heavier conditioner, as I did the first time [the accompanying conditioner], as it left my hair feeling lame and over processed with residual.  It didn’t irritate my scalp, which I am rather sensitive.  Nice shampoo with a ‘rich’ feel, but go light on the conditi7if you use one."

It is a strong coconut scent that lingers throughout the day.  Even late in the afternoon, I can still smell it on my hair and it makes me smile.  This may be a turnoff for others because it is very strong, but it works for me.  It also doesn't weight down my hair and has enough moisture to get me through the day in my dry climate.  I wish it helped volumize while moisturizing,but I can't have it all."

At the same time, my hair is quite dry and, as I’ve aged, the grays are a little coarse, so I do need to use conditioning products for manageability.I was pleasantly surprised to find that this mask does just what I need. It seems heavy, but it rinses thoroughly and gives my hair just the right boost of conditioning.  I’m really pleased with the results and glad I went ahead and tried this."

It does contain coconut oil, milk, murumuru and mango butters, which hydrate and nourish the hair. It has a light and refreshing coconut scent.

773,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR 4C HAIR,"At first I thought this would be another hair fail. I have 4C hair, and there are so many products that promise to be compatible that aren't, all they do is dry you hair out, and sit on top of it making it gritty and harder to manage. I have low porosity hair, and most products just don't work for me. I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."

It did not work for her hair at all see pics(last two) however for my hair it did great! I have 4a/4b hair. It defined my curls perfectly! The moisture was disappointing especially since this product is supposed to be for very dry hair; It was just ok. Overall I will not be purchasing it again for my daughter but MAY buy it for myself. If you have 4c hair save your money!

827,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dry after effect on hair,It has a good slip and gave good curl definition .

I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

La consistencia del shampoo es un poco espesa y con muy poco es suficiente, el acondicionador está muy bien y deja un agradable olor."

This and the Monoi Carol’s Daughter masks are really good. Don’t get the almond one though. It’s thick, and it makes your hair silky! If you have frizzy hair, you’ll still need something for your ends when your hair is dry, like Schwarzkopf for Ends."

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"
1,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"I have thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and this product didnt do anything for me. It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I have bouncy curls now!,"I never thought I could just let my curls air dry and be done, but with this hair mask that is very much possible! I’m so happy with my purchase! I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"
5,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,ZERO STARS - WORST. SMELL. EVER. And no way to get it out of hair.,I shampooed my hair six times with anothe product and cannot get this horrific smell out of my hair. God help me.
6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Day 1 styling,"Love the hold, definition, and shine it adds to my hair on day 1. If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."
8,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This is now my favorite product. It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."
9,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite hair mask (type 3c/4a/4b hair),"The hair mask is AMAZING... im not a fan of the smell and it does linger in your hair (reminds me of the Aveeno lavender baby lotion) ... BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This actually works !,"So I have the worst dry hair. Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."
11,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,HOLY GRAIL HAIR PRODUCT,"THE HOLY GRAIL CURLY HAIR PRODUCT, PPL!!Everyone go buy this - and then go back and buy it again for anyone you love. This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but didn’t deliver,"I am trying to find something less expensive than Kinky Curls custard. Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."
14,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product.,I have issues with odors ; My friends know not to come around me with smelly ( perfumes soaps deodorant etc.)  this has a nice clean smell and does not linger.
15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."
17,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells amazing, great hold and shine","This stuff is great! I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"
18,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Coco Creme EXCELLENT Product!,I love Carols Daughter products and was happy to see the launch of the Coco Creme line.  I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.
22,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best find for my kinky curls, after 40 years of searching!","I had stopped buying products since nothing seemed to work for my kinky, white-girl curls. I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"
23,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only Carol's Daughter Product I use,"I've purchased Carol's Daughter products in the past and many of them were average, for me.  Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."
25,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous,Been using this product for years Never leave home without it!
26,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Left My Hair Dry & brittle,"After first applying Carol's Daughter Coco Creme to my damp hair I could feel my hair turning hard.  I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."
27,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My Favorite Hair Mask,"I love this deep moisture hair mask for my dry/damaged curly hair. I apply this to my hair every time I wash it, which is usually 2-3 times a week. I leave it on for at least 5 minutes to really moisturize my hair. I love the smell and it makes my hair soft, silky and shiny."

I've been looking for something like this for so long and I finally found it. This leave in conditioner is perfect for my curls, it softens and moisturizes my hair and the smell  OMG just divine!!! I'm proudly going to say that this is my new creme and I will be trying more of their other products for sure."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."
30,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like old spice, but my hair feels great!","I’ve used the original hair milk in the past and really liked it, so I decided to try the coco creme hair mask.This does not smell like coco or cream or any combination of the two. The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."
31,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rinse Out Type of Hair Mask,"Some of these reviews people been talking about how it doesn't make their hair curl talking like they think it's a leave in conditioner cream. This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

It goes in smoothly. My hair doesn't feel crunchy but looks and feels soft without the frizz. What sold me is my hair doesn't feel gross and tangled when I take a shower after using it. So glad I found a replacement product. Winner

Super dry hair problem solved in first use.,"Since my hair started going gray it has become unmanageable and I’ve been struggling to figure out how to care for it. It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

Goodbye hair spray.,"My curls are so happy! After using Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo and conditioner I used this styling butter. This was the only product I used and there's absolutely no frizz! Very thick butter so a little goes a long way.

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or this is just a bad batch but it’s horrible."

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips. Then I did the same thing at my roots surrounding my face. But the greatest thing was that I didn't habe ti do or add anything else to get defined curls and waves. This is my new go-to. I also bought the conditioner and I am buying the shampoo next."

I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

I am obsessed w the Black Vanilla shampoo & conditioner,  so I decided to try this one and it was like the total opposite.My hair turned out feeling like hay, wouldnt style easily, nor detangle well. Also my scalp was left feeling so dry and itchy I had to run serum through my strands and it was STILL dry...And frizzy and dull!I recommend the Black Vanilla moisture products."

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming. The intensity of the chemical smell plus coconut  did reduced overnight but not enough. To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

Hair is soft when using this. I’ve used this a month now in addition to other products because I don’t like my hair poofy. 1 jar does last me a month with every day use, a little goes a long way with this product. 4 stars because of the price and I can’t give 4.5."

My hair went from mostly moisturized to frizzy, DRY (it actually began to crackle and break), my curl pattern became kinky instead of spirals. This isn't for dry hair. This isn't for anybody's hair, really."

I have 4c low porosity hair, and I used the Cantu leave-in before this one and it worked well for me but I wanted to find a moisturizer that is black-owned and works just as well. Guess I'll keep looking cuz this one ain't it."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.  I will also be trying the Coco Crème shampoo and conditioner."

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

I can even use it without a conditioner(I try not to!), and it still tames everything down.For me it's worth it, and I hope they never stop making it.  I don't want to keep adding to my reject pile of shampoo bottles if they did!"

Smells amazing, super easy to distribute evenly through hair and really nice hold but still feels soft to the touch. Unfortunately the package I received this time was severely damaged and there was no gel in the container because it spilled all over the box. Box was wrapped in plastic but soaked in gel. Will update my review when new product arrives."

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

After purchasing and wasting money on products that claim to work on “very dry” hair,  I brought carol’s daughter thinking it would solve my problem.  This product breaks my hair.  It contains mineral oil.  And it’s a cream not a paste.  My hair has to be wet."

Its very moisturizing my looked amazing after i used it. But Oh. My. Gosh. The smell is infuriating it gave me horrible headaches and lasted for days. I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

I washed my hair earlier and only added this product.. Later that evening after hair dried it looked white, so I used a brush on my hair and this is what happened. So very very disappointed.

While most gels leave your hair crunchy, heavy, and frizzy, this product left my hair light-weight, soft, and the best it has ever looked.

It isn't overpowering once you wash it all off but when you have it on it feels excessive. I use it about once a week or every two weeks and I really don't find much of a difference in my hair, it gives *some* moisturization but I prefer other masks I've tried."

It's soft- it makes my hair Softer and it's super Moisturizering. For anyone like me who doesn't know what to use on your hair, go to a natural hair salon and get a hair consultation. They're usual free. It's okay to ask a professional. And there is a difference between this - a pudding- the hair Milk (also a great product) a cream."

69,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great.,It’s one of my favorite hair products. It works great as a hair mask and leave in conditioner because it deeply hydrates and defines my hair but it irritates my scalp a little and makes it itch. I still enjoy this product though and I would recommend it to everyone with natural hair.

Not very happy with this product at all and I love the shampoos and conditioner.

The top has been wiped down like it was once sticky. Not sure if it’s safe to use or if it was tampered with. I read the reviews that it doesn’t come with an additional seal, but it would have been helpful in this instance to know if it was tampers with."

My kid had 4c hair and the average moisturizers don't work for his hair type. This worked like a charm. His hair was soft, moisturized, and it smelled so good. Another plus was the shipping time."

I smell like I just stepped out of the beauty salon and not necessarily in a good way. I can literally taste the cloud of fragrance hanging around my hair. It's too much & that really sucks cuz my curls do look better.Update: after day 4 I had to throw the rest away. The fragrance made me so nauseous I almost ralphed after my shower. Never again."

I've purchased several of this product line. It smells wonderful, feels great on my hair and great for styling.

I cannot use products that contain a lot of oil.  It will just sit on my hair and take away  any natural wave or curl.  My hair responds to products that have more water.

She has coppery corkscrew curls... with the right product.This product is the only product in 13 years that ‘consistently’ detangles her curls and keeps them bouncy. We’ve tried everything from kerastase to Unite to Mixed Chics. Most work for a little while but eventually weigh her curls down, leave her frizzy or just crunchy. Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."
627,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,"This conditioner is supposed to be helpful for ""extremely dry hair,"" which is not the case for me--mine tends toward oily.  But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."
628,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thick, coarse, dry, wavy/curly, highlighted hair.  I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."
631,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I love this! It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."
635,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used the Carol's Daughter Coco Creme (more like mist?) on my thick, straight-type hair when it started to frizz, and it has instantly helped defrizz and curl my hair the way I wanted it to! The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I have to say that it worked fantastically.  I used it every day after I got back from the beach or pool, and my hair has stayed soft and pliable.  No noticeable sun, salt or chlorine damage.  I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It is not very expensive either so that is another big plus. It is a lovely smelling coconut mist that you apply to your hair that makes your hair look fantastic. The coco water comes in a little bottle with a nice mister on the top that allows you to evenly apply the coco water to your hair.I find it really makes the hair look great and smell fantastic, if you like coconut that is. I for one do and this works well for me."

It kept them defined and smelling good all day. Haven’t noticed any flaking. However, if you use a lot in one section, the curls have like a firm-crisp feeling, but not crunchy, just firm. It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

This one is heavenly!  When you have curls, you don't want heavy products.  This mist smells amazing.  I love how lightweight it is.  I sprayed this on my clean hair, once while damp and again while dry.  My curls were not sticky or stiff, but shiny and smooth.  While I do not have very dry hair, I felt that this mist added a nice amount of hydration to my hair.  I will definitely use this as a refresher for my curls on days that I do not wash my hair.

645,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."
646,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,This carols daughter product is a cream gel for wash and go and styling hair. The scent of the product is amazing it smells really good. The gel is light weight and does not weigh down hair. The gel cream is a little tacky or sticky when applying but that feeling goes away. I use this product on my natural hair and my weaves and it works well. Also I love the size of the jar you get a lot of product to last you a little while depending on how much you apply.

While I still have frizz, I feel like I'm able to have more days where my hair is down versus it being up in a bun or in a ponytail. I love the smell of the spray and I also like how much product is in the bottle. I'm able to use this to refresh my hair throughout the week or for what I need additional moisture added to my hair. I would definitely get this again because of how much I've been enjoying my curls. I also like how long the mist is when dispensing the product into my hair; one spritz goes a long way."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

I’ve always been a fan of carols daughter but this was my first time trying this. The smell is very pleasing as well. I have a 3c/4a hair type and I like to use after I apply my products. i don’t section I just spray right on top and where I feel I need it but mostly focusing on the roots and ends. I even like to apply it at the end of the day after I take it out of my protective styles. It helps aid in my dryness. It takes my curls to a new level of definition making them less frizzy and last longer in my wash and go process. I would love to try more from this line!
651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."
652,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,shampoo is NOT moisturizing,"maybe i'm crazy, or maybe a lot of the places online to READ reviews for the SHAMPOO are misleading.I have very ringlety, VERY thick 3c hair. I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

My hair is so naturally dry I don't even rinse the conditioner out; I just gently work the conditioner down to my ends and squeeze out the conditioner with the excess water. This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo. The pump is handy. I prefer for my conditioner to have a pump so I can measure each time I use it (3 pumps). I don't know who Carol is or her daughter, but they make some pretty good hair products for curly hair."

The smell of this mask is amazing.  It has a sweet, coconut fragrance that lingers long after rinsing the product out of your hair.  The mask itself is very thick and silky feeling and absorbs quickly into the hair.  Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.  Every time I have used this mask, it has left my hair feeling nourished and smooth.  It also brings a bit of shine back to my hair.  Great product that is made in the USA."

I have very curly/frizzy/dry hair & after using these products I am amazed! Totally worth the buy. It leaves my hair smelling amazing & bouncy. No crunchy finish at all. From what I’ve seen ,for real results without any frizz coming out of your moisturized curls you gotta put in the work ladies! Finger curl each strand for the best results!

Rhassoul Clay

   shampoo and conditioner for months now, and I really like those.  This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

This Carol's Daughter hair mask worked well for me. It is intended to be used as a weekly treatment, which is what I have been doing for the past month. The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent. Although I have some Carol's Daughter shampoo, this works just as well with my normal shampoo. It's definitely worth a try if you have color treated and/or damaged hair."

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly. Carol’s Daughter has become by far my favorite line of shampoos and conditioners."

As it has thickened it gets so dried out if she does not condition and wash it everyday. I don't think hair should be washed that often. I wanted something that would help. She has been using this for a couple weeks and I have noticed a softening. It has a coconut, vanilla scent that just smells amazing. I wish it had more natural ingredients, you shouldn't have to pay a price like this for an ingredient list like that. It is nice and thick and lathers well and is ok for color treated hair."

But don’t hold that against the company! If you have dry, damaged, processed hair, this conditioner is a lifesaver. It is probably one of the only hair products I’ve used that has resulted in a visible improvement in my hair. I have long highlighted hair which has never been the healthiest from years of color. Using this conditioner regularly for the past few weeks has made my hair look healthier and shinier. Even the ends (currently way overdue for a trim) are less split. And it smells like heaven!

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours. So the idea of a moisturize and conditioner in one was enticing. But the problem with this product is that it contains alcohol, and that, as most people know, dries your hair. So it is counter intuitive... the benefits of the coconut oil get erased by the drying factor of the alcohol. Oh well."

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.) My thick, curly hair absorbed it well enough, though the product is a bit thin. My hair, once dry, looks nice, but I have difficulty with the wet comb-through.  With a conditioner that works well, I can comb my wet hair easily.  So this product is a bit of a disappointment."

Some, like this conditioner, I like less than others.My hope was for a light cocoa butter-ish smell and that it would work for my daughter's leaning-toward-oily hair. Sadly, the scent is very strong and sickeningly sweet (I do have sensitive sinuses) while it enhances the oiliness of her hair. She only used it a few times before we had to stop. I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

It is a fairly thick cream and it rubs into my hair well. It also rinses out thoroughly. The fragrance is kind of strong. It's a pleasant scent and it lingers while my hair is still wet, but it fades once my hair is dry. The container has ample to last a long time. The screw top works well. I can easily unscrew it to get the product I need and it seals again tightly to keep out water from the shower. I use it two or three times a week and it leaves my hair feeling soft and looking healthy."

Love the pump dispenser.  I really don't notice my hair being any different using this product than other conditioners I've tried.  So I'd consider this a solid choice but maybe not something that stands out enough to warrant the current price.  It would take a chemist to decipher the ingredients list to compare this with a three dollar bottle of Suave Professional conditioner and understand how one claims to be better than the other.  Since I'm not a chemist, I'll probably stick with a more budget friendly product."

Very llite and pleasant fragrance.  The richness of the shampoo struck me as most shampoo has a different viscosity and feel.  I decided that I would Not apply a heavier conditioner, as I did the first time [the accompanying conditioner], as it left my hair feeling lame and over processed with residual.  It didn’t irritate my scalp, which I am rather sensitive.  Nice shampoo with a ‘rich’ feel, but go light on the conditi7if you use one."

It is a strong coconut scent that lingers throughout the day.  Even late in the afternoon, I can still smell it on my hair and it makes me smile.  This may be a turnoff for others because it is very strong, but it works for me.  It also doesn't weight down my hair and has enough moisture to get me through the day in my dry climate.

I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."

826,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy with this product,This butter leaves my hair stiff and it leaves a residue in my hair which makes my hair look dirty as if I have uncontrollable dandruff.
827,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dry after effect on hair,It has a good slip and gave good curl definition . But after I crunch out the cast it leaves my hair feeling dry not soft. I did try using less. But still get the dry texture. Not for me. 🙃😕
828,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST CONDITIONER,"This has been by far the best conditioner I have ever tried. I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

This and the Monoi Carol’s Daughter masks are really good. Don’t get the almond one though. It’s thick, and it makes your hair silky!

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"
1,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"I have thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and this product didnt do anything for me. It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"

6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."

If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."
8,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This is now my favorite product. It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."

BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."

Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."

Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."

15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."

I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"

I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.

I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."

I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.

I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"

Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."

The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."

I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."

29,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."

The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."

This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it.

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips.

I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!

It works great as a hair mask and leave in conditioner because it deeply hydrates and defines my hair but it irritates my scalp a little and makes it itch. I still enjoy this product though and I would recommend it to everyone with natural hair.

The top has been wiped down like it was once sticky. Not sure if it’s safe to use or if it was tampered with. I read the reviews that it doesn’t come with an additional seal, but it would have been helpful in this instance to know if it was tampers with."
72,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hair conditioner,I've used Carol's daughter products before and nothing really wowed me until the deep conditioner.

My kid had 4c hair and the average moisturizers don't work for his hair type. This worked like a charm. His hair was soft, moisturized, and it smelled so good. Another plus was the shipping time."

The thickness is fine because it does seem to moisturize my hair, but I cant enjoy the product if I have to wash product out each use. I really wanted to love it, but I feel like I wasted money because I had to buy a different product."

I smell like I just stepped out of the beauty salon and not necessarily in a good way. I can literally taste the cloud of fragrance hanging around my hair. It's too much & that really sucks cuz my curls do look better.Update: after day 4 I had to throw the rest away. The fragrance made me so nauseous I almost ralphed after my shower. Never again."

I cannot use products that contain a lot of oil.  It will just sit on my hair and take away  any natural wave or curl.  My hair responds to products that have more water.  This product works well with my hair texture.  I just wet my hair, massage into the scalp and ends and style."

She has coppery corkscrew curls... with the right product.This product is the only product in 13 years that ‘consistently’ detangles her curls and keeps them bouncy. We’ve tried everything from kerastase to Unite to Mixed Chics. Most work for a little while but eventually weigh her curls down, leave her frizzy or just crunchy. Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

It cleans my scalp Without stripping my hair and it smells amazing. A surprisingly small amount spreads all over my hair and has good slip with a silky lather.

I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."

I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."

First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."
627,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,"This conditioner is supposed to be helpful for ""extremely dry hair,"" which is not the case for me--mine tends toward oily.  But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I have to say that it worked fantastically.  I used it every day after I got back from the beach or pool, and my hair has stayed soft and pliable.  No noticeable sun, salt or chlorine damage.  I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

641,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I typically love Carol's Daughter's products-my hair is more of a 2C, for reference, and on the thin side, but the products always work well.That said, I don't love this one as much as Monoi, which is my favorite.To begin with, this really leaves my hair feeling moisturized, soft, and silky immediately after use. The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

It does make her curls pop and shine! It does provide a hold and makes her hair a tad bit crunchy. It isn't too hard so I am ok with it. It keeps her curly hair looking nice and shiny for the day. It has a nice smell. It is a great value for the price and size of the container. I recommend this product

My hair is curly/wavy and extremely dry, like I can never seem to get enough moisture.Out of the jar, it seems like it's going to be great, like the consistency of a body butter product. It feels really moisturizing.This product is heavy, weighs down the hair a ton, makes it look really dull/unhealthy, it's hard to run your fingers through, and the hair feels sticky.Today is my 2nd time using it.

This one is heavenly!  When you have curls, you don't want heavy products.  This mist smells amazing.  I love how lightweight it is.  I sprayed this on my clean hair, once while damp and again while dry.  My curls were not sticky or stiff, but shiny and smooth.  While I do not have very dry hair, I felt that this mist added a nice amount of hydration to my hair.  I will definitely use this as a refresher for my curls on days that I do not wash my hair.  Best of all, this product is free of silicone and parabens.  I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this curl mist.  Love it!"
645,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."
646,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,This carols daughter product is a cream gel for wash and go and styling hair. The scent of the product is amazing it smells really good. The gel is light weight and does not weigh down hair. The gel cream is a little tacky or sticky when applying but that feeling goes away. I use this product on my natural hair and my weaves and it works well. Also I love the size of the jar you get a lot of product to last you a little while depending on how much you apply.

While I still have frizz, I feel like I'm able to have more days where my hair is down versus it being up in a bun or in a ponytail. I love the smell of the spray and I also like how much product is in the bottle. I'm able to use this to refresh my hair throughout the week or for what I need additional moisture added to my hair. I would definitely get this again because of how much I've been enjoying my curls. I also like how long the mist is when dispensing the product into my hair; one spritz goes a long way."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

I’ve always been a fan of carols daughter but this was my first time trying this. The smell is very pleasing as well. I have a 3c/4a hair type and I like to use after I apply my products. i don’t section I just spray right on top and where I feel I need it but mostly focusing on the roots and ends. I even like to apply it at the end of the day after I take it out of my protective styles. It helps aid in my dryness. It takes my curls to a new level of definition making them less frizzy and last longer in my wash and go process. I would love to try more from this line!
651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."
652,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,shampoo is NOT moisturizing,"maybe i'm crazy, or maybe a lot of the places online to READ reviews for the SHAMPOO are misleading.I have very ringlety, VERY thick 3c hair. I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

I really like this company. I love that their products, like this one, has NO silicones, parabens, petroleum, mineral oil or artificial colors.  I find the fragrance of this one to be light and refreshing overall. Not overpowering for a man and I believe lots of women will also enjoy it.  Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.  I honestly have received and reviewed many different shampoo and conditioner products from different companies. Carols daughter is one of my favorite. This is a company I would buy from again."

But as it drys your skin feels awesome. When I googled where to buy, is when I discovered it was for your hair. WHAT A LAUGH I HAD. Sorry but I'm going to use it all over. It's great.

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

But I love the product so much that I can put up with the smell. I put a good amount of gel on my wet hair as it is long and curly. It sure is gel...slimy and all. But it works. I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes.

This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.

I like to try lots of hair products and am giving this one 3 stars for the scent alone. Maybe it will work for you."

This Carol's Daughter hair mask worked well for me. It is intended to be used as a weekly treatment, which is what I have been doing for the past month. The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent. Although I have some Carol's Daughter shampoo, this works just as well with my normal shampoo. It's definitely worth a try if you have color treated and/or damaged hair."

This product works great with both. One daughter has tight curls and my other has very lose curls. I love that you can use this spray on wet or dry hair. Neither of their hair was stiff or sticky after using it. The scent is subtle, but refreshing. This product is very light weight, which is great for my kids hair. Does not leave a buildup of product."

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly. Carol’s Daughter has become by far my favorite line of shampoos and conditioners."

As it has thickened it gets so dried out if she does not condition and wash it everyday. I don't think hair should be washed that often. I wanted something that would help. She has been using this for a couple weeks and I have noticed a softening. It has a coconut, vanilla scent that just smells amazing. I wish it had more natural ingredients, you shouldn't have to pay a price like this for an ingredient list like that. It is nice and thick and lathers well and is ok for color treated hair."

It gave me hair a good enough curl, but it was on the crunchy side, which I didn't love.  My hair is odd, curly in some parts, wavy or straight in others.  The curly parts definitely curled, it wasn't enough help for the wavy/straight parts to follow suit though.  It does smell nice and a little goes a long way."

I won't be buying this one again. This conditioner has barely any slip - I actually feel like it makes my hair MORE knotty and tangled than when I started! If you want a similar price range, stick with maui moisture or shea moisture conditioners and leave-ins."

But don’t hold that against the company! If you have dry, damaged, processed hair, this conditioner is a lifesaver. It is probably one of the only hair products I’ve used that has resulted in a visible improvement in my hair. I have long highlighted hair which has never been the healthiest from years of color. Using this conditioner regularly for the past few weeks has made my hair look healthier and shinier. Even the ends (currently way overdue for a trim) are less split. And it smells like heaven! Highly recommend."

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours. So the idea of a moisturize and conditioner in one was enticing. But the problem with this product is that it contains alcohol, and that, as most people know, dries your hair. So it is counter intuitive... the benefits of the coconut oil get erased by the drying factor of the alcohol. Oh well."
682,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great,"This has some nice ingredients, such as coconut oil & mango butter. I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.) My thick, curly hair absorbed it well enough, though the product is a bit thin. My hair, once dry, looks nice, but I have difficulty with the wet comb-through.  With a conditioner that works well, I can comb my wet hair easily.  So this product is a bit of a disappointment."

Some, like this conditioner, I like less than others.My hope was for a light cocoa butter-ish smell and that it would work for my daughter's leaning-toward-oily hair. Sadly, the scent is very strong and sickeningly sweet (I do have sensitive sinuses) while it enhances the oiliness of her hair. She only used it a few times before we had to stop. I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

Nope.  Not dandruff - just an allergic reaction.  So I was happy to see this come up.  Yay!  No scalp scratching, which can be kind of embarrassing when you work somewhere where people consider you family and feel just fine calling you out for scratching your scalp.Ugh!  Don't you just hate that?Right.  Anyway, my hair stays clean for a couple of days, and there's no disgusting scratching.  The price is decent.  It smells good.  Love it!"

It is a fairly thick cream and it rubs into my hair well. It also rinses out thoroughly. The fragrance is kind of strong. It's a pleasant scent and it lingers while my hair is still wet, but it fades once my hair is dry. The container has ample to last a long time. The screw top works well. I can easily unscrew it to get the product I need and it seals again tightly to keep out water from the shower. I use it two or three times a week and it leaves my hair feeling soft and looking healthy."

Love the pump dispenser.  I really don't notice my hair being any different using this product than other conditioners I've tried.  So I'd consider this a solid choice but maybe not something that stands out enough to warrant the current price.  It would take a chemist to decipher the ingredients list to compare this with a three dollar bottle of Suave Professional conditioner and understand how one claims to be better than the other.  Since I'm not a chemist, I'll probably stick with a more budget friendly product."

It’s difficult for me to find conditioners that smooth but are lightweight enough not to weigh it down. This conditioner is just right.

Very llite and pleasant fragrance.  The richness of the shampoo struck me as most shampoo has a different viscosity and feel.  I decided that I would Not apply a heavier conditioner, as I did the first time [the accompanying conditioner], as it left my hair feeling lame and over processed with residual.  It didn’t irritate my scalp, which I am rather sensitive.  Nice shampoo with a ‘rich’ feel, but go light on the conditi7if you use one."

It is a strong coconut scent that lingers throughout the day.  Even late in the afternoon, I can still smell it on my hair and it makes me smile.  This may be a turnoff for others because it is very strong, but it works for me.  It also doesn't weight down my hair and has enough moisture to get me through the day in my dry climate.  I wish it helped volumize while moisturizing,but I can't have it all."

At the same time, my hair is quite dry and, as I’ve aged, the grays are a little coarse, so I do need to use conditioning products for manageability.I was pleasantly surprised to find that this mask does just what I need. It seems heavy, but it rinses thoroughly and gives my hair just the right boost of conditioning.  I’m really pleased with the results and glad I went ahead and tried this."

I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."

826,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy with this product,This butter leaves my hair stiff and it leaves a residue in my hair which makes my hair look dirty as if I have uncontrollable dandruff.
827,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dry after effect on hair,It has a good slip and gave good curl definition . But after I crunch out the cast it leaves my hair feeling dry not soft. I did try using less. But still get the dry texture. Not for me. 🙃😕
828,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST CONDITIONER,"This has been by far the best conditioner I have ever tried. I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

832,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,The product is good but I can't stand the smell,The product is a nice consistency and holds my curls well but the smell is extremely strong and reminds me of axe body spray or some other men's cologne.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

844,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",Style: Hair Mask,Verified Purchase,"Retread my frizzy hair!! This and the Monoi Carol’s Daughter masks are really good. Don’t get the almond one though. It’s thick, and it makes your hair silky! If you have frizzy hair, you’ll still need something for your ends when your hair is dry, like Schwarzkopf for Ends."
