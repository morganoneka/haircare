0,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Hold and Moisture,"This product is great for my 4c hair.  I used to avoid creams (only using hair mousse or gels) for twisting my hair because it would leave white flakes.  This product does not flake and it has made my two-strand twist look better than before.  I do not have to constantly re-twist my hair at night.  So, the product has a great hold and it also offers superb moisture.  This add so much more moisture than any mousse or gel I've ever used.  In addition to this cream, I am going to purchase additional products from this line."
1,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,No more sticky residue,"I finally found a hair product that doesn't cause a sticky build up. My daughter has lots of thick hair. I can use this on her hair daily, without that sticky buildup. It has a nice light scent and you can use it on dry or damp hair. I love it and will buy more ."
2,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"mix with curly magic curl stimulator, holy grail 🙌"
3,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pricey product for the quantity,"Loved this product! Very moisturizing butter, with a thick creamy consistency. Only reason I can't give it a five is on the price. I only got two uses out of such an expensive product."
4,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good But No Hold,"I like the way this product made my hair feel. Its soft, and light curls, but there is no hold. So after one day, I have to do my hair completely over and it frizzes. Unlike the Curly Magic product they also sell, it has a hold, and I can wake up, fluff out and GO - the next day."
5,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ll be hard pressed to find another butter better than this I think,Absolutely smoothest butter ever. INSTANTLY smooths and detangles and leaves my hair very moisturized. I don’t think I can live without it. I’ll  be hard pressed to find another butter better than this I think.
6,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Stuff,I am enjoying the lovely curls this product brings out in my hair. I highly recommend it.
7,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,"I have used for two years, great for natural hair, only need small amount 2-3 days a week, helps to define natural hair pattern"
8,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Absolutely love this product! It was my first time using it and I was pleasantly surprised! I used it along with the other products. I typically wear a lot of weaves and wigs I’m looking for more ways to protect my natural hair. I used this after I washed my hair. Smells Devine as well!
9,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Unsealed & half product,"This product came without an inside seal, it was taped on the outside. All products l have purchased from this manufacturer have inside seals. The container had 2/3 of the product & not full. Suspect it was tampered with. Definitely not getting this from this seller again. Better of buying this from my local walgreens."
10,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Nature hair.,"The only problems is I wish it would come in a larger container. This is the perfect for Nature hair, it isn't greasy or heavy. Yes I will continue to purchase this product. Thank you"
11,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,"Good for people with type 4c hair like me, I recommend use with another hair product."
12,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps to manage and condition my gray hair!,This one of the best hair products I’ve ever used!!!And I’ve been around for a while- great on hard to condition gray hair
13,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,So much slip,The product is easy to detangle and slides through my natural hair. It has become a staple for my hair routine.
14,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad delivery,Although I love this product and I’m glad there’s bigger versions of it. For the price I expect the product to come like this. Quite a bit of the product had exploded out the seal and leaked outside where the plastic was and this is just not acceptable. Smh
15,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect curls , less frizz",I seriously love this product. I have very curly frizzy hair and nothing has ever lasted in my hair to look nice I just get an Afro. With extra butter you only have to use a small amount and it works so good! My curls stay good for 2-3 days! And they are stunning.
16,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Got the wrong product,I ordered the butter but the supercurl . I’m disappointed at the mix up but I do like the scent of the supercurl and I’m trying it out.
17,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent moisturizer,I literally love this product. I use it as a daily moisturizer or to refresh my twist out. No residue or flaking. Only downside is the price for such a small amount. I wish they had a bigger size.

36,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best moisturizer/daily styling product for thirsty 4c hair,"OMG! This is the one. My 2 year old daughter was blessed with a head full of thick coily 4b/4c hair. I actually tried this as part of a travel kit and now I want all items. I was at my wits end with styling  her hair but this....this worked a miracle. All boxes are checked; No sticky build up, detangling, moisturizing, smells great, and light enough to be used daily.  This may be pricey but I’ll continue to purchase as long as I can because it’s worth it."
37,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best curly hair cream I never used.,"I recommend it 👌. Stop hair breaking,makes my hair very shine and keeps my hair healthy. I love it,no worries about your hair when you're purchasing this cream,you won't regret. I got my hair back,very soft. Thank you seller"
38,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thick, moisturizing, and also great for wavy/looser curls","I have mostly 2C hair that forms larger ringlets and deep waves, but it's INCREDIBLY frizzy and dry, so I usually find I get better results with thicker products, and just use less of them. Bought this to use with the Curly Magic and LOVE the combination. This creme is super thick and rich, so I usually grab a dime size, work into one side, another dime size, work into the other size, and a third that I gently scrunch in while my hair is upside down, before applying the Curly Magic.The results initially while drying felt semi-stiff, but were easily scrunched out while drying without causing too much frizz, and settled into some really nice, soft curls that didn't feel weighed down or overly rough, which sometimes happens with my hair when the products don't have enough moisture. The hold is softer, so after a day or two, the frizz creeps back in, but overall, this helped give a lot of shape and moisture that held up well over several days and was refreshed easily. I literally just touched up with roots with some water after shaking my hair out of the cap and was able to just go.Definitely recommend!"
39,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved, Loved, LOVED!!",Absolutely loved the extra butter crepe!! Kept my son’s hair hydrated and soft. Doesn’t flake or dry out like some other products!!
40,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy,Smells amazing and moisturizes very well
41,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Just Okay,It does okay but moisture feel to hair only lasts a couple of days.
42,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,Love it!
43,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this,"The butter paired with the curl stimulator 😁😁😁 try it, you won’t regret it."
44,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Uncle w,Price was a bit too high. I’ll get it somewhere else next time.
45,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product does what it need to do,Worked like I want it to work
46,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't mix with the curl magic. Ended up with white clumps.,The butter is probably great on its own but I used it under the curl magic and just ended up with a head full of white clumps that I didn't have time to wash out. I follow the curly girl method and I air dry. Which means I do wash in goes every other day. Which also means I don't usually spend a lot of time washing my hair. I love the curl magic but this combo was a mess for me.
47,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I miss the original owners!!!,"Almost the entire product line has glycerin as the main ingredient, which drys out my hair and causes breakage. UFD used to be a staple and the only products that worked. I tell everyone to use Kinky Curly (water based) or Qhemet Biologics (oil based). What is Phenoxyethanol anyway?"
48,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair so dry,No for my hair!😬
49,"Extra Butter Curl Forming Creme, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It smells Wonderful and works!,This product is thick and I use very sma;; amounts
0,Supercurl 8 Ounce,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn't buy again for type 4 hair but still love the brand,I had such high hopes for this product because I use the curly magic gel and I'm addicted to it. I'm pretty dissapointed to say the least as the product has absolutely no slip. My hair usually loves soybean oil but the combo in this mixture was a bit off balance. When applied to my hair it was way too much water that did nothing to my har but after twisting my hair my hands were quite greasy so looks like the oil transferred to my hands and not really to my hair. I've used it on wet and on dry hair (type 4) with still no good results. I'll still purchase other products in this line but this was a waste of money and it's quite expensive on Amazon.
1,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Increased moisture, softness and definition on 3rd day hair!","I have 4C hair. I used ""Supercurl"" on a damp, third day, twa UFD ""Curly Magic"" wash n' go just as an experiment, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. It revived my wash n' go and extended it for a full 3 days. The moisturization and softness were better than good, but it was the shine and definition that really impressed me. Uncle Funky's Daughter ""Curly Magic"" and ""Supercurl"" (and throw in some ""Glossy"" for good measure) really made a difference in the look and feel of my hair."
2,Supercurl 8 Ounce,4.0 out of 5 stars,Uncle Funky's Daughter,This product is very moisturizing and provides a great hold during Twisting process. I wish all the Uncle Funky's products were more readily available at retail stores.
3,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Moisturizer for Twist Outs,"This is a wonderful product. I started using the Curly Magic in this line over a year ago to trap water i my hair and had great results, so I'm not surprised that this product is just as good with moisturizing. My hair was recently in braids and was very dry when I took them out. The second time I washed my hair I put Curly Magic on right after rinsing out my conditioner then blow dried my hair with a diffuser. A few days later this product arrived. I used it to put my hair in twists for a twist out. When I took my twists out the volume and definition was gorgeous (I have 4b hair) and my hair was totally supple and moisturized without feeling greasy or frizzing up from too much moisture. Will definitely purchase again."
4,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cool,"I liked that the product smells really good but it's a little watery. Nevertheless, I will continue to use with other products...thank you."
5,Supercurl 8 Ounce,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my hair...,"My ""hair"" did not like this product. I had heard so much about this company and thought I would purchase the product. Well, it's probably great for others but my 4""z"" hair did not like it. I have read that natural hair goes to 4c but not my hair. It requires it's own category and 4z fits it."
6,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great moisturizer,This is only my second day using this product but it does a good job of locking in my hair's moisturizer.
7,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing results,Amazing smell and works amazing in my hair! I love this product and will be buying more from this line.
8,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff.,"I'm just trying now and it's great ,but for the price I was hoping for a bigger jar.I will be shopping around to find a cheaper price next time ."
9,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff.,Great for my hair. Creamy and nourishing. A great mix with the Uncle Funky products or others.
10,Supercurl 8 Ounce,1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage product and price,"Did not like this stuff, it did nothing great for my curls.....it dried them out.  I should have listened to others reviews but I wanted to try it out for myself....never again!"
11,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,"Works well, use a small amount in sections wet or dry hair, works well."
12,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product-high price,"This is the best curling cream! Yes, the price is high and not discounted on Amazon. It’s the same price at CVS AND It’s a small jar."
13,Supercurl 8 Ounce,1.0 out of 5 stars,Seal was broken!,Product arrived with the seal broken! Afraid to use it now.

19,Supercurl 8 Ounce,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great Smell; Too Heavy for 2B-3A Curl,"The product smells fabulous, but it is too heavy for my 2b-3a hair. It weighs down my curls near the crown of my head. Though, it moisturizes well."
20,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reality as advertised,Works beautifully to make short hair curly and easy to manage.
21,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing,Excellent product
22,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great,I like this product when using it for my wash and go’s. I layer it under uncle funkys daughter curl magic and innersense I create hold. It doesn’t have as much slip as innersense quiet calm curl control but is a good replacement.
23,Supercurl 8 Ounce,4.0 out of 5 stars,Such a small amount of product for the heavy price,Holds your curl nicely and keeps your hair very lustrous and healthy looking
24,Supercurl 8 Ounce,4.0 out of 5 stars,Product not sealed..,"I'm very pleased that my package arrived on time. However, my Supercurl product was not sealed and I'm a little nervous about using it.  😬"
25,Supercurl 8 Ounce,2.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged,This package arrived with most of the product out of the container and in the shipping package. I was only able to recover about 2/3 of it.
26,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the clean smell and works well on damp or ...,It works well on my gray hair.  Love the clean smell and works well on damp or dry hair.
27,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but overpriced,Love this product but seller is overpriced compared to other sites.

30,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!,Received this product in a sample form from a friend who attended natural hair show. I used the sample and then ordered product to use daily. It leaves my hair feeling soft. It is not greasy. My hair is very dry but this product put moisturizer in my hair.
31,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great curl hair cream,Instant curls
32,Supercurl 8 Ounce,1.0 out of 5 stars,"ALWAYS READ LABELS. Do not be hoodwinked by ""natural"" presentation and clever marketing.",At first it seemed to work well. But my hair became increasingly dry each day of use. Looked at ingredients and saw alcohol and sulphates. Threw out 2/3 Of the jar.
33,Supercurl 8 Ounce,4.0 out of 5 stars,Know what you're reading...,"I've only used this once but I really wanted to respond to some other comment about alcohols and sulfates. I did not see a single sulfate in the ingredients list, the alcohol listed is cetaryl alcohol which is a fatty alcohol. NOT a drying alcohol and is beneficial for the hair. It's always good to read labels but don't assume that all alcohols or sulfates are bad. I use a curly girl method on my hair that cuts out harmful sulfates, silicones, drying alcohols and mineral oils and this stuff is safe and smells amazing. My hair loves it today but it's the first day of use so I can't comment on long term use! I wish I could have simply replied to the other comment but am unable to. :(Ingredients list from website:SUPERCURL FULL INGREDIENTS LISTWater, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Honey, Polymide-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Fragrance, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Glyceryl Stearate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia (Macadamia) Seed Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Caramel."
34,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Non-Greasy Moisture,"This was a nice surprise! I've had this for over a year in a travel/try it kit. I tried the Extra Butter, but it's too heavy for my hair. I have fine strands, and highly porous Afro-textured hair. When I try to refresh with water-based products, my hair frizzes out, so I try not to do it, and usually my products cooperate for 3-4 days. I don't like to rewet my hair to refresh either (but sometimes you have to do it ). It's been really dry over the summer, so I've been experiencing more dryness than usual.Anyway, this moisturizer works really well with Thirsty Curls and Curly Magic as a refresher. I had to refresh my canopy, and I'm always hesitant to do it, but it worked out! Once it dried, my curls/waves were clumped back together, and I had a nice non-greasy, soft, but firm hold.  This product contains glycerine, which can usually make a product sticky also, but no stickiness (that comes when I put the gel over it). There were no fly-aways or that weird frizz one can get when you try to refresh. This will work well until I get ready to shampoo.After those results, I had to order the full size (I always have the 32 oz Curly Magic gel on hand because it is my favorite). You don't have to use a ton of product. I would say with Thirsty Curls, you shouldn't use a lot because it tends to suds/bubble, but once you put the Curly Magic over it, it calms down. Seems tricky to use, but it's worth it. Don't be heavy handed. Step 1) Refresh with Thirsty Curls (not too much), 2) Apply Supercurl, and 3) Curly Magic (or gel of choice)."
35,Supercurl 8 Ounce,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly girl bff,"We have been using this product for 5 years now and have tested a ton of others, nothing compares to the moisture this leaves while keeping the hair pliable and it does not flake. It has a great smell and lasts a long time. My daughters is mixed and has a ton of hair."
36,Supercurl 8 Ounce,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazed,It smells amazing. My girls love the smell of it and the fact that it leaves their hair nice and smooth is incredible. I never really give reviews on any hair products because I feel like I’ve never found anything good for curly hair.Its expensive but worth every penny.

2,"Good Hair Conditioning Styling Creme, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works better with the Curly Magic gel,"I used this as a leave-in and a cream base for my 3c-4a twists.

1,"Shining Star Hair & Scalp Elixir, 6 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,Very very greasy
2,"Shining Star Hair & Scalp Elixir, 6 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Too thick with a strong smell.,"The struggle is real when trying to get the oil out of the bottle. Either the oil is too thick or the owner could benefit from switching to a bottle with an actual applicator, like the one the Camille Rose brand has for their Buriti hair oil. To be honest, UFD products really are for people with 4C hair types. I am not sure why the other hair types are still listed since all formulas seemed to have changed to mostly alcohol-based and silicone. This is one of few without alcohol, but so many different oils give it a weird smell. But yeah, if you buy this hair elixir, you're going to have to unscrew the cap to apply the oil."
3,"Shining Star Hair & Scalp Elixir, 6 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful for hair and skin!,"I love this oil it's a slightly thicker oil but it's not greasy.  No scent great ingredients I use on my hair, scalp, skin and for hot oil treatments in my 4C hair!"
