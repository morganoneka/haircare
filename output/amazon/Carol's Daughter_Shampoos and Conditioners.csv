   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"
1,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"I have thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and this product didnt do anything for me. It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."
3,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,1 product  Serious curl definition,Very great product for naturals the best I’ve ever tried.
4,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,It worked! I have bouncy curls now!,"I never thought I could just let my curls air dry and be done, but with this hair mask that is very much possible! I’m so happy with my purchase! I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"
5,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,ZERO STARS - WORST. SMELL. EVER. And no way to get it out of hair.,I shampooed my hair six times with anothe product and cannot get this horrific smell out of my hair. God help me.
6,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."
7,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Day 1 styling,"Love the hold, definition, and shine it adds to my hair on day 1. If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."
8,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This is now my favorite product. It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."
9,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite hair mask (type 3c/4a/4b hair),"The hair mask is AMAZING... im not a fan of the smell and it does linger in your hair (reminds me of the Aveeno lavender baby lotion) ... BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."
10,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,This actually works !,"So I have the worst dry hair. Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."
11,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,HOLY GRAIL HAIR PRODUCT,"THE HOLY GRAIL CURLY HAIR PRODUCT, PPL!!Everyone go buy this - and then go back and buy it again for anyone you love. This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."
13,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",2.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but didn’t deliver,"I am trying to find something less expensive than Kinky Curls custard. Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."
14,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product.,I have issues with odors ; My friends know not to come around me with smelly ( perfumes soaps deodorant etc.)  this has a nice clean smell and does not linger.
15,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."
17,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells amazing, great hold and shine","This stuff is great! I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"
18,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Coco Creme EXCELLENT Product!,I love Carols Daughter products and was happy to see the launch of the Coco Creme line.  I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.
22,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best find for my kinky curls, after 40 years of searching!","I had stopped buying products since nothing seemed to work for my kinky, white-girl curls. I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"
23,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only Carol's Daughter Product I use,"I've purchased Carol's Daughter products in the past and many of them were average, for me.  Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."
25,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous,Been using this product for years Never leave home without it!
26,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",2.0 out of 5 stars,Left My Hair Dry & brittle,"After first applying Carol's Daughter Coco Creme to my damp hair I could feel my hair turning hard.  I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."
27,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,My Favorite Hair Mask,"I love this deep moisture hair mask for my dry/damaged curly hair. I apply this to my hair every time I wash it, which is usually 2-3 times a week. I leave it on for at least 5 minutes to really moisturize my hair. I love the smell and it makes my hair soft, silky and shiny."
28,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,All that your curls need!!!,"Just amazing!!!!! I've been looking for something like this for so long and I finally found it. This leave in conditioner is perfect for my curls, it softens and moisturizes my hair and the smell  OMG just divine!!! I'm proudly going to say that this is my new creme and I will be trying more of their other products for sure."
29,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."
30,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like old spice, but my hair feels great!","I’ve used the original hair milk in the past and really liked it, so I decided to try the coco creme hair mask.This does not smell like coco or cream or any combination of the two. The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."
31,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rinse Out Type of Hair Mask,"Some of these reviews people been talking about how it doesn't make their hair curl talking like they think it's a leave in conditioner cream. This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."
32,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Winner Hair Gel,I have been trying so many curly hair gel products after mine was discontinued and this one is it! It goes in smoothly. My hair doesn't feel crunchy but looks and feels soft without the frizz. What sold me is my hair doesn't feel gross and tangled when I take a shower after using it. So glad I found a replacement product. Winner
33,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product! Super dry hair problem solved in first use.,"Since my hair started going gray it has become unmanageable and I’ve been struggling to figure out how to care for it. It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

Goodbye hair spray.,"My curls are so happy! After using Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo and conditioner I used this styling butter. This was the only product I used and there's absolutely no frizz! Very thick butter so a little goes a long way. I pat my finger tips onto the butter and rub into my fingers, and then through my hair. I am a fan!"

When properly moisturized, he has a head full of big gorgeous curls.  Finding the right product for him has been difficult.  So happy to have taken a chance on this mask after reading reviews.

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or this is just a bad batch but it’s horrible."

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips. Then I did the same thing at my roots surrounding my face. But the greatest thing was that I didn't habe ti do or add anything else to get defined curls and waves. This is my new go-to. I also bought the conditioner and I am buying the shampoo next."
40,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft and curly.,"I'm still feeling this out but I think I like it.  I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming. The intensity of the chemical smell plus coconut  did reduced overnight but not enough. To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

Hair is soft when using this. I’ve used this a month now in addition to other products because I don’t like my hair poofy. 1 jar does last me a month with every day use, a little goes a long way with this product. 4 stars because of the price and I can’t give 4.5."

My hair went from mostly moisturized to frizzy, DRY (it actually began to crackle and break), my curl pattern became kinky instead of spirals. This isn't for dry hair. This isn't for anybody's hair, really."

I have 4c low porosity hair, and I used the Cantu leave-in before this one and it worked well for me but I wanted to find a moisturizer that is black-owned and works just as well. Guess I'll keep looking cuz this one ain't it."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.  I will also be trying the Coco Crème shampoo and conditioner."

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

I can even use it without a conditioner(I try not to!), and it still tames everything down.For me it's worth it, and I hope they never stop making it.  I don't want to keep adding to my reject pile of shampoo bottles if they did!"

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

Its very moisturizing my looked amazing after i used it. But Oh. My. Gosh. The smell is infuriating it gave me horrible headaches and lasted for days. I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

It isn't overpowering once you wash it all off but when you have it on it feels excessive. I use it about once a week or every two weeks and I really don't find much of a difference in my hair, it gives *some* moisturization but I prefer other masks I've tried."

It's soft- it makes my hair Softer and it's super Moisturizering. For anyone like me who doesn't know what to use on your hair, go to a natural hair salon and get a hair consultation. They're usual free. It's okay to ask a professional. And there is a difference between this - a pudding- the hair Milk (also a great product) a cream."

Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

620,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."
627,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,"This conditioner is supposed to be helpful for ""extremely dry hair,"" which is not the case for me--mine tends toward oily.  But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

645,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

651,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while.

I find the fragrance of this one to be light and refreshing overall. Not overpowering for a man and I believe lots of women will also enjoy it.  Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.  I honestly have received and reviewed many different shampoo and conditioner products from different companies. Carols daughter is one of my favorite. This is a company I would buy from again."

With out reading it I assumed it was a body moisture, so I applied it to my legs, hands, and arms. I LOVE IT. It should be for your body too. At first it seemed greasy. But as it drys your skin feels awesome. When I googled where to buy, is when I discovered it was for your hair. WHAT A LAUGH I HAD. Sorry but I'm going to use it all over. It's great. I give it a 10 for sure. If I made you smile or laugh too. Your welcome.  :) Pam"

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."
658,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deeply hydrating,"The summer humidity had left my curls feeling dry and frizzy, and my normal cowash routine seemed to get longer everyday as my regular conditioner no longer had the same slip so I was more than excited to try this conditioner. First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

But I love the product so much that I can put up with the smell. I put a good amount of gel on my wet hair as it is long and curly. It sure is gel...slimy and all. But it works. I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

Was hoping this would be perfect for my hair, but when it arrived I realized how strong it smelled....If you read the ingredients list, ""Parfum (Fragrance)"" is surprisingly high up on the list (appears before the stabilizers and all the good fruit extracts), and you can really tell. This stuff has a very strong, sharp artificial scent that, for me, is a total turn off. I'm sensitive to strong fragrances and won't be able to use this at all. So bummed!"

I have super dry, thick, frizzy hair and it works great. I was so glad to finally try their sulfate-free shampoo too. I have been using Deva-Curl NoPoo Shampoo and it works great, but I like to change up my shampoo and not use the same one all the time. This Coco Creme Shampoo feels like it cleans my hair, but doesn’t dry it out at all. I only wash my hair about twice a week, so this bottle lasts a long time for me. You only really need one squirt for medium length hair. Smells great too! Love it!"

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

I don’t have very curly hair so I need product to make the curls happen. I love the smell of this — kind of like coconut. The scent is light and doesn’t last, but it’s nice when you’re spraying it on your hair. I have several other products by Carol’s Daughter and they all work really well and are made with ingredients that don’t hurt my hair or dry it out."

Even after just one use you can see and feel the results. My hair looks so healthy and has a shine that it didn’t before. This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

My hair is so naturally dry I don't even rinse the conditioner out; I just gently work the conditioner down to my ends and squeeze out the conditioner with the excess water. This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo. The pump is handy. I prefer for my conditioner to have a pump so I can measure each time I use it (3 pumps). I don't know who Carol is or her daughter, but they make some pretty good hair products for curly hair."

The smell of this mask is amazing.  It has a sweet, coconut fragrance that lingers long after rinsing the product out of your hair.  The mask itself is very thick and silky feeling and absorbs quickly into the hair.  Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.  Every time I have used this mask, it has left my hair feeling nourished and smooth.  It also brings a bit of shine back to my hair.  Great product that is made in the USA."

I have very curly/frizzy/dry hair & after using these products I am amazed! Totally worth the buy. It leaves my hair smelling amazing & bouncy. No crunchy finish at all. From what I’ve seen ,for real results without any frizz coming out of your moisturized curls you gotta put in the work ladies! Finger curl each strand for the best results!

Rhassoul Clay

   shampoo and conditioner for months now, and I really like those.  This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

This Carol's Daughter hair mask worked well for me. It is intended to be used as a weekly treatment, which is what I have been doing for the past month. The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent. Although I have some Carol's Daughter shampoo, this works just as well with my normal shampoo. It's definitely worth a try if you have color treated and/or damaged hair."

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly. Carol’s Daughter has become by far my favorite line of shampoos and conditioners."

As it has thickened it gets so dried out if she does not condition and wash it everyday. I don't think hair should be washed that often. I wanted something that would help. She has been using this for a couple weeks and I have noticed a softening. It has a coconut, vanilla scent that just smells amazing. I wish it had more natural ingredients, you shouldn't have to pay a price like this for an ingredient list like that. It is nice and thick and lathers well and is ok for color treated hair."

But don’t hold that against the company! If you have dry, damaged, processed hair, this conditioner is a lifesaver. It is probably one of the only hair products I’ve used that has resulted in a visible improvement in my hair. I have long highlighted hair which has never been the healthiest from years of color. Using this conditioner regularly for the past few weeks has made my hair look healthier and shinier. Even the ends (currently way overdue for a trim) are less split. And it smells like heaven!

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours. So the idea of a moisturize and conditioner in one was enticing. But the problem with this product is that it contains alcohol, and that, as most people know, dries your hair. So it is counter intuitive... the benefits of the coconut oil get erased by the drying factor of the alcohol. Oh well."

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.) My thick, curly hair absorbed it well enough, though the product is a bit thin. My hair, once dry, looks nice, but I have difficulty with the wet comb-through.  With a conditioner that works well, I can comb my wet hair easily.  So this product is a bit of a disappointment."

Some, like this conditioner, I like less than others.My hope was for a light cocoa butter-ish smell and that it would work for my daughter's leaning-toward-oily hair. Sadly, the scent is very strong and sickeningly sweet (I do have sensitive sinuses) while it enhances the oiliness of her hair. She only used it a few times before we had to stop. I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

Love the pump dispenser.  I really don't notice my hair being any different using this product than other conditioners I've tried.  So I'd consider this a solid choice but maybe not something that stands out enough to warrant the current price.  It would take a chemist to decipher the ingredients list to compare this with a three dollar bottle of Suave Professional conditioner and understand how one claims to be better than the other.  Since I'm not a chemist, I'll probably stick with a more budget friendly product."

Very llite and pleasant fragrance.  The richness of the shampoo struck me as most shampoo has a different viscosity and feel.

This coco creme shampoo lives up to its name. I washed my hair in it and to be honest, I was worried that it would be troublesome to wash out the shampoo. This is the creamiest shampoo I have ever used. It lathered so much from just a dash of shampoo.I love the fragrance.I didn't need to worry, the shampoo washed out just like any other shampoo, and it left a lovely scent."

After big chopping in '15, I used the black vanilla shampoo conditioner combo and it was a great addition to my hair regime to help it grow back quickly. I loved the smell of the black vanilla, but this coco creme is even better. Same great moisture and slippage even with my hard water situation out here in the desert."

Factor in the drying air of winter and my hair looks and feels like straw. Lightly fragranced, this shampoo lathers richly and rinses cleanly. It is moisturizing and leaves hair feeling healthy and soft. I would not use if hair is oily. Nor would I use it everyday. But it does ease dryness and make hair look and feel touchable."

But when I applied it, the lather was so rich and luxurious that I realized a little goes a very long way.  And the result?  My hair looks and feels nice.  This is something I think I could use every day and not have my hair turn into straw."

It rinses out well, but that lingering coconut perfume does linger a bit.  It's a good mask, though, and I'm going to continue to use it until it's gone."

I'll stick with my current washout conditioner and use the leave-in version to add extra moisture."
708,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thick, luxurious, moisturizing coco butter shampoo is wonderful! First, I needed only a small amount, much less than I usually must use, when I shampooed my very long hair. This shampoo suds up easily and cleans as it moisturizes. After I used it, my hair was ultra-soft and tangle free. This shampoo contains no sulfates, parabens or artificial colors. It does contain coconut oil, milk, murumuru and mango butters, which hydrate and nourish the hair. It has a light and refreshing coconut scent. In addition, this wonderful shampoo comes in any easy-to-use pump bottle for your convenience. It is fairly priced for an excellent, concentrated shampoo.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."

773,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR 4C HAIR,"At first I thought this would be another hair fail. I have 4C hair, and there are so many products that promise to be compatible that aren't, all they do is dry you hair out, and sit on top of it making it gritty and harder to manage. I have low porosity hair, and most products just don't work for me. I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."
774,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for 4c hair!,I purchased this product along with the curl enhancing moisture cream for my daughter who has 4c hair. It did not work for her hair at all see pics(last two) however for my hair it did great! I have 4a/4b hair. It defined my curls perfectly! The moisture was disappointing especially since this product is supposed to be for very dry hair; It was just ok. Overall I will not be purchasing it again for my daughter but MAY buy it for myself. If you have 4c hair save your money!
775,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,I get so many compliments on my hair,"So far I am please with this conditioner and the shampoo.  I have tried so many different products since I've gone natural about 8 yrs ago. I do not have natural curls,  therefore I need to moisturized my hair to bring the curls out. I've consistently been using this and I'm please. I use a different brand after shampoo and conditioner called leave in or rinse out conditioner by Shea Martin."

I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."

I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Curly Hair Products Gift Set by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Silicone Free Hair Butter, for Very Dry Curly Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

This and the Monoi Carol’s Daughter masks are really good. Don’t get the almond one though. It’s thick, and it makes your hair silky!

With this gift set I saved over $8 and considered buying more however I would have paid full price rather than what I received.  The shampoo I received is separated, after trying to shake and move shampoo around in the bottle it did nothing but loosen the material on the bottom of the bottle.  I will try to actually mix it up to see what happens.  It feels like old product was put in a set and reduced in price, sold as a gift."
1,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,USE CAUTION!!!,"The scent was amazing!! Amazing enough to trick me into using this product for much longer than I should’ve. This was the WORST for my natural 3b/3c hair. It left my hair EXTREMELY tangled! Naïvely i continued use thinking my hair was the problem. Then after a few weeks (I wash only once a week) i noticed my scalp began to flake! I mean SNOWING! I’ve never had that problem before using this product.I’ve switched shampoo and after the first wash my hair and scalp instantly feel and look much better.Just a heads up, if you notice extreme knitting or tangling, TRUST ME it won’t get better. STOP using this product immediately!On the other hand it may work for you, but it was the worst decision of my natural hairs life!"

However, after the first use, all of the aforementioned issues have been totally fixed! I was hesitant to try this, because I'm a man, but they work perfectly, and smells awesome, too!

I ordered these 2 days ago and they came today in a beautiful package. I am super excited about long term results on my long Asian hair. Will be adding before/after pictures soon :)I did a home keratin treatment about 2 months ago and since then I have been trying to find affordable brands for shampoos and conditioners that are sulfate-free. I think I finally found 1 that I like. It has the most beautiful natural smell I have ever seen in any hair product.

Have had a chance to actually use it. As as mentioned on another review, the dark ""stuff"" in the bottle really does not want to mix into the shampoo. I finally dumped it all into a bowl and used a wire whisk to incorporate it. Time will tell if it stays mixed. Before I did that, huge amounts of the dark matter in the bottle was trying to come out. It does smell amazing. Does not work a rich lather, but lather does not actually clean hair. It did rinse well, and I followed with the conditioner. Rinsed out with cool water. Hair did not feel conditioned as I am used to, but again, time will tell with results."
5,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,It made my scap itch,"I had such high Hope's for this product, especially how bad people were racing about it. I HATE it. What a waste of money ☹. It has a weird muted vanilla smell, chemically. It leaves your hair really really dry! It was awful, my poor hair dried like hay. For w.e reason this product made my scap so itchy and sensitive. Idk how or why but it did. I have washed my hair 4 times with it so far and I just hate how mybhair is looking, it's just so dry and not happy. I was sad my hair and scalp didnt appreciate this product the way everyone else's hair has, bit it was just a no from me."

The shampoo is rather thick, which means that just a little can go a long long ways. There’s also a very clean feeling left on your hair & scalp after using this combo for a couple days.I am extremely satisfied so far and definitely plan on ordering this set of shampoo/conditioner again:-)"
7,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my hair again,"I've used this shampoo and conditioner for almost a year, and with Amazon it's been a breeze to order and have it shipped and it's arrived in perfect condition each time, though it's been disappointingly unavailable recently.  I have always had long, thick, wavy, frizzy hair which has been losing its shine in recent years, gotten thinner, and I was losing a battle with dandruff.  Since using this, the dandruff cleared up with the first bottle and shine started coming back.  My hair is less brittle and the ends don't split as quickly, not as frizzy, and its thicker again! I love this shampoo/conditioner. I won't be using anything else in the foreseeable future. I love my hair again."
8,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Shampoo looks & feels like mucus,"I've bought this before as a set from BJs and it was  ice.  Unfortunately, each time I pressed the pump out comes shampoo with the look AND consistency of a wad of tan and black snot.  What the heck happened in the storage phase if this product?!  From now on, I will only buy it in a walk in retail store.  The only reason I give it 3 stars is for the conditioner that was fine. Would be 5 star IF the shampoo had not been so grotesque in texture."
9,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,My curls have never looked better!,"This stuff is SO good. I found it on a BuzzFeed list and thought I'd give it a try. My hair is weird - usually it's only curly on the bottom layers and the top layer is wavy and frizzy and unmanageable, which is why I usually just put it up in a ponytail because I don't have the patience for it. This stuff has changed all of that! The photo attached is after only one use. Every curl is soft and looks great. I also used the Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus moisture spray after I got out of the shower and I think the two products combined did a fantastic job.This stuff smells great, too - I do smell a bit of a chemical undertone, but it doesn't bother me too much as it's not that noticeable. I have been getting compliments on how I smell all day, as the scent seems to linger.I had no issues with the packaging, either. I was a little worried after reading other reviews, but it all came in one piece and the pumps worked fine.This is a great value for the price - I will definitely be buying again!"
10,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works!,I have wavy damaged hair and a sensitive scalp. If I use Pantene or dove my hair falls out. If I use all natural my scalp becomes very itchy because I think I have allergies to flowers and certain extracts. I have so many unused bottles of shampoo and conditioner and with having wavy hair it can become very frizzy too. I have used this shampoo and conditioner for several weeks now with no itch and it has helped the overall condition of my hair. I’ve been growing out my damaged hair from years of bleaching and it even helps tame that part of my hair. I really feel like I’ve found something that works. Thank you!
11,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,IT WORKS,"LOVEEEE. I had a feeling it would be good based off the story but once I opened it and I smelled it, I knew it would be a go-to. Now after I actually used it, I immediately knew my hair was more moisturized. I typically use a leave in conditioner after already conditioning. Im hispanic and my hair is straight with some waves(also dyed for the last 20 years) so I was worried it could be oily after(that happens alot) but it wasn't at all. my boyfriend complimented me 3 times saying how nice and healthy my hair looked. You've earned another happy customer ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
12,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Huge mistake,"First the smell. It was awful. Smelled like some kind of cheap vanilla musk body spray. You know the kind you know better than to pick up, but you sniff it anyway hoping this time it'll smell like real vanilla? Only its 100 times stronger.  Had to pull my hair back in a bun and the smell still gave me a headache.  As for moisturizing? Umm not a bit. My hair was dry, frizzy, and VERY tangled after using.  Hope this can be returned."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing better,"I have been using this set for over three years and I will not default from it. I also use the Black Vanilla 4 in one combing cream. My daughter has really long hair (she sits on it), and she has A LOT of hair. She is also tender headed (oh the dread). These are the only product that give the results I want for her hair. Did i mention it smells AMAZING? Every where we go people tells her how good her hair smells. The first picture I had just shampooed her hair and I straightened it to clip her ends. The second picture was about a year ago and after shampooing her hair, I put it in two strand twist. I ONLY use these three products on her hair from the Black Vanilla line. I do not believe in using a lot of products. Find one thing and stick with it until the hair shows you otherwise. ""If it works, don't fix it."""
14,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Bad Experience!,I have no idea what was wrong with this shampoo.  It smelled like plastic which somehow I thought might smell different on my hair. But NO it still smelled like something plastic. It made my hair feel like straw immediately!  I had a very hard time getting it out off my hair.  It took 3 washes with another shampoo and conditioner and honestly my hair felt damaged for nearly a week afterwards.  I have natural dark blonde Caucasian hair and my hair is VERY healthy.  I wish I had returned it for my money back but before I realized I could do that I just TRASHED IT.
15,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware: Not Carole's Daughter Product.,"I have used this product off and on for several years and have recently been getting monthly deliveries through Amazon.  My most recent delivery is NOT a Carole's Daughter Product.  There is no scent. Zero. If you have ever used this product, you know that the scent is distinct. My concern is about what exactly I put on my head!? Cancelled subscription. Knockoffs and quality control have made me decide to shop anywhere but Amazon."
16,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,In Love!,"In a bid to move away from my once beloved Moroccan Oil shampoo (which started to leave my hair super dehydrated and sapped of nutrients. It left a great shine though) I opted to try out these Carol's Daughter products on a Black Friday deal: boy am I glad I did. My first time using it this past week and I'm in love with how it treated my hair! The scent is amazing and it left my hair actually feeling clean and moisturized and smelling great. The conditioner especially was my favorite, it was like sweet smelling milk in my hair and a weird pleasure to watch wash down my sink lol. My 4C hair also felt super soft and bouncy after I was through, which Moroccan Oil never did- MO always left my hair feeling like brillo. If you have 4C hair that needs a pick me up try these out its worth every cent."
17,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Try it! It's great ❤👍,"I am a white chic with long, fine, thick, color treated hair. I've used Aussie shampoo and conditioner for many many years but my hair and scalp was always oily one day after washing and I started having spots of scabby flakes. I stumbled on this set and took a chance. I love it! My hair stays clean feeling and looking for several days and the itchy scabby spots are correcting (3 washes so far). Con: the pump on my shampoo doesn't work well but hopefully it's just a bad one in the lot. The conditioner is... dryish? Like, hard to spread through my hair. I dont know how else to explain it. I have to pump a lot of it for my long hair. I am going to try the leave-in conditioner to supplement. The smell is lovely! Overall, I love it!"
18,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,😇Genuine Review- Make Sure to read Before purchasing🤨,"This product is great my scalp was really dirty although I had already washed it. I did a baking soda and apple cider vinegar rinse of my scalp if I had went in with my usual shampoo would have had a lot of breakage because as I am dries out my hair, but this shampoo helped alot to bring the moisture back into my hair since that rinse dryed out my hair. The shampoo had enough slip to separate my hair strands, if I would have went in with the conditioner after my rinse I would have had alot of breakage because I separate before I brush through with the conditioner so that goes back into the shampoo having moisture and slip and shall I add curls were poppin with only the SHAMPOO!!! after separating it of course. Also I may add that I have problems areas in my scalp even after I wash and this helped.NOW THE CONDITIONERI going to say this rn I mixed to different conditioners together for slips and moisture and hydration and softness. This conditioner adds moisture and softness but for my hair alone it doesn't have enough slips even when I let it sit there and soak up the moisture and add plenty of water. I use maui bamboo fibers gives me alot of slips hydrates my hair and strengths my strands. If I use the Carlo's Daughter conditioner alone I get alot of breakage because it doesn't have slip or enough of it for my hair. I have very dense and thick and it getting longer and harder to take care of, I have mainly 3c 4a and a good amount of 4b and low porosity. But both of these two conditioners together are boom 💥. BTW I have been using that combo for about a year maybe almost two and my hair has grown past my bra straps well 4 to maybe 5 inches above my nip. It was at my shoulders and I was learning what working for my hair and what doesn't.ENDING OF REVIEWIf you are looking for a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner then give this a try it worth a shot but can't grantee it will work for your hair you won't know until you try. Well that's it for my review goodbye ladies and gentlemen. 🙃😊"
19,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,May Be Fake,"I have not had issues purchasing this specific listing in the past, however, the last delivery I got, did not smell anything like the usual. I have used this shampoo for years now, and the pump was also different and pours a very small amount. The texture of the shampoo was also thicker. I am unsure if I will purchase on Amazon because I suspect it is fake, unless something has changed from the overall formula. The ingredient list on the bottle was not different however."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very satisfied,"I recently started wearing wigs and I want a good moisturizing product for my natural kinky wavy but very dry hair. The shampoo lathers very well and made my hair very soft. The conditioner provided good coverage with little product, actually so did the shampoo. After the wash condition and drying process, my hair felt very soft not waxy silky but almost like a baby blanket lol idk but that's what I thought when I felt it. My used to be dry hair also has a nice shine. It smells ok nice and light after it's dry. It did have a slightly stronger scent when washing but not overpowering. I like it. Even my braids are soft and shiny nice products."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silky soft curly hair!,I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars! I have never found a product where I don’t need to brush my hair out of the shower again after already brushing it in the shower. When I get out of the shower I put my hair in a microfiber towel and usually I’d have to brush through it again with a wide tooth comb because it’s already frizzy- this was not needed with Carol’s Daughter products! I’m literally blown away at how silky soft my hair is. The picture shown was without any product in and straight out of the shower. Amazing amazing!
22,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,Although I believe there was something wrong with the one bottle I purchased from Amazon.  I used this product many times before and it's amazing especially for dry and curly hair.  For some reason the bottle I received from Amazon the ingredients kept settling at the Bottom of the bottle which I never experiment from previous order before. Had to shake well before used.
23,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells delightful but left my hair like sandpapered straw. Meh,"My naturally curly, voluminous, long (almost to the base of my spine), thick hair isa mixture of 2C, 3A, and/or 3Bdepending on differing factors.When sopping wet, my hair is 3B and 3A almost evenly mixed.The strands are individually very fine,but there’s a massive amount of them.It takes a long time for my hair to soak up water or to fully dry after washing.I have several autoimmune diseases and other chronic illnesses/health issues,so I’m pretty picky about my hair productssince the wrong ones can trigger rashes, matting, hives, folliculitis, etc.Sometimes it’s really a pain trying to find anything that might meet my needs.When I read the seemingly endless, glowing reviews of Carol’s Daughter I was thrilled and eager to try it. I really wanted to smell it too.The shampoo and conditioner both smell like a lovely, warm, peaceful yet exciting place.The fragrance is very heady but not overpoweringand makes you feel like you’re receiving a good hug.Unfortunately that’s about the only nice thing I have to say about it.The shampoo couldn’t seem to lather quite right.It felt slippery, slimy, and sticky all at onceand didn’t mix well with the water.Almost instantly after application, my hair started feeling damaged and ultra dehydrated.Bizarrely, I could actually feel my hair getting rougher and drier the longer the shampoo was on my hair.As soon as it was on, the strands immediately started to snag on each other and on my fingertips. I started to worry....After lots of attempted lathering and trying to avoid tangling, my locks were somewhat sudsy.Still, they never got foamy enough to give the sensation of being thoroughly clean.No matter how much I rinsed or what temperature the water was,it never felt like the shampoo washed all the way out.It left a grimy layer on my hair and on my scalp.Ick.The conditioner seemed thick at firstbut then felt thinner and less smooth/rich once it was on my hair.I needed a lot to completely cover everything.It sat on my head for 5 minutes or so.Then I separated and detangled my curls with a wide tooth comb while my hair was still wet and coated with conditioner.It wasn’t easy like it should’ve been though.The comb should’ve slipped through my curls without resistance.Instead, my hair stuck to itself and made little knots all over.Progress was slow and frustratingAt last, when I was done rinsing, my hair didn’t feel at all hydrated or healthy.My sad strands felt fried, fragile, and extremely prone to tangling.Every scratchy single hair kept catching on one another and snarling.I was so upset to have a head of puffed up, frizzled, angry, straw hair after using this stuff.Even my argan oil and my Silk Therapy couldn’t completely fix the state of my hair right away.That’s when I knew just how severely those products had dehydrated and damaged my hair.Another unpleasant bit:99% certain the grimy layer left on my scalp from the shampoo contributed to and possibly directly caused a fungal infection.Sheer misery.It’s taken me almost 2 months of intensive moisturizing treatments, scalp scrubs, leave in conditioners,and antifungal shampooing to return my poor hair to some semblance of normal.So yeah, using these products hasn’t been the best experience for me.But hey, I’m weird and riddled with all kinds of super strange maladies.....so what happened to me probably won’t happen to other folks."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst hair product I've ever tried!,I've literally never seen my hair feel so straw-like and dry. The absolute worst product for my hair. Couldn't wash it off my hair fast enough.Natural curly/waivy hair type 2c/3a for reference.
25,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dry and knotted,I do not like this shampoo and conditioner me and my daughter use it she has natural hair and it made her very tangled and dry I on the other hand has perm hair and it did the same thing. We had to use tresme condition to soften and detangle our hair.
26,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Black Vanilla Shampoo & Conditioner,"I'll start off with my hair, I'm not sure what ""type"" of hair I have but it's pretty long (comes down to the top of my butt) and is super thick. My hair is also super dry and because of this I can only wash it once a week. I've been using the Black Vanilla shampoo and conditioner for about 3 weeks and I'll start by saying I love the smell, it's strong but not sickeningly strong. Both shampoo and conditioner are pretty thick and a little really does go a long way (I only need about 4 pumps of each) As far as cleaning my hair it does a wonderful job, my hair feels super clean and decently soft but I'm only giving the product a 3 star review because my hair feels dryer than normal after use and I bought this particular kind because it's supposed to help moisturize the hair. Because I like the smell, the cleaning power, and the consistency of this brand I'm going try a different type and see if it does any better for my dry hair."
27,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love this shampoo",My granddaughter is mixed and I was looking for a good shampoo for her hair and I ran across this one and thought I would give it a try and I'm so glad I did. She is sooo happy with the way this shampoo makes her hair look and feel. It also smells so good. Well I gave it a try myself and I love it too so now this is the only shampoo the whole family uses. But the best thing about this shampoo is when you're hair is in between having a black woman's hair and a white woman's hair it makes it so easy to style my granddaughters hair and when she's happy I'm happy!!
28,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Formula change,"Beware that this IS NOT the original formula that Lisa Price  (founder of Carols Daughter ) created. Since the business was sold to l'oreal, they have changed the original formula. I have bought this product for the last 8 years and it is NOT the same formula as the original. I notified them with screen shots clearly showing that they changed the original product, after they assured me that there was no change. No response from L'oreal. They put natural products as the last ingredients, and put more alcohol based products in, which drys out hair. Not a fan anymore. So sad  ..."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,The slime is REAL!,"I seriously loved this shampoo the first time I bought it. Enough so that I ordered two of the gift sets to share with my niece and sister, who both have the same hair texture as I do. I read the reviews about the ""slime"" problem, but didn't think much of it since I had not had that experience in the first order. Luckily, I checked these before gifting, because the ""slime"" is real, and very gross! It won't even mix together once you have it in your hands. The darker porting stays together and glides over your hands, down your arm, and plops on the shower floor. After pumping out about two inches of the shampoo, I finally got rid of it all. THE if the remaining ingredients work as well as I hoped...Either the ingredients are not being mixed well enough or the formula has changed. I will hesitate to purchase this again."

Im a black women with thick hair"
31,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing!!,Used it yesterday for the first time and it does smell amazing! Think the way a vanilla candle smells but for your hair lol. It did lather very well and I'm guessing they made it different than what other reviews are saying because there isn't any black stuff in either the shampoo or conditioner. I don't think it's OK for chemically treated hair because after using the conditioner I still had to use a leave in conditioner. Lathers well smells amazing!!
32,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Clean, Shiny, Light, Bouncy Hair After One Use","My usual ""clarifying"" shampoo left a waxy coat on my hair and hands after usage. I'd follow it up with a coconut oil based system, which was moisturizing but heavy. Eventually, my hair became heavy, dull, lifeless, and difficult to style. I considered a few other brands  before taking a chance on Carol's Daughter, and after one use, I've got my hair back!I washed it twice to make sure I got my hair squeaky clean, and left the conditioner on for about 10 minutes while I did other things. Upon blow drying, I could tell how weightless my hair was. It flat-ironed easily, and my hair was left super shiny, light, and bouncy.NOTE:  I am multiracial with very thick, wavy hair."

After trying this for a few weeks, my husband and I realized it wasn’t good for our fine, thin hair. It could, of course, be good for others. It made our hair look as if it were full of static electricity. Also, it seemed to worsen my itchy scalp condition."
34,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best product I've ever used,"Shampoos have never made a difference in my hair.  No matter what brand I bought or how expensive.  It's always a rating from terrible or glad it's not terrible.  I had long ago accepted that as long as it cleans my hair and doesn't make it super frizzy, I'm good.  But this Black Vanilla is a game changer.  I didn't even get it for the shampoo.  I got it for the conditioner since historically conditioners are what makes the difference in my hair.  But I thought what the heck, I'll get the shampoo too... and wow.  I was totally caught off guard.  My hair is soft, tame, manageable.  I didn't know it was possible for shampoo to do that!  I highly recommend this one!"

These are awesome!! The smell is delicious!! And it leaves my hair feeling clean, but not heavy.  I had used a different Carol's daughter product before and did not like it so I was hesitant, but I am so glad I tried these!  It really does make my hair feel more moisturized!"
36,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells wonderful!,"I had a sensitivity to this shampoo and conditioner set.  I was told about this brand through my sister who is also very sensitive to many shampoos as well. But unfortunately is wasn't for me even though it made my hair shiny, and smell great. My skin on my scalp, and neck got a rash. But I think most people could do very well with this product."
37,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,You Will Fall in Love With Carols Daughters Products,This is my daughters absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner. I saw Carols Daughter products on the Tyra Banks show 14 years ago. If you have curly hair this is definitely the product for you. It may not be your hair that’s unmanageable. It could be your shampoo and conditioner.  Carols Daughters products knows exactly what your hair needs and what it doesn’t. It’s called the curly hair method. The smell is  divine and pleasant. When my daughter uses the product she always says how much she loves Carols Daughter.
38,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for thick curly kinky hair,"I’m in heaven. I read the ingredients and then I read the reviews and I decided to but this product for my 4a hair type and I used it on my daughters 4c hair type and it worked wonders. Left her hair so shiny, soft and smelling great! I’m a fan and my shampoo and conditioner were packaged fine. No guck and funk and no spillage. The box was new and the bottles had tape around the nozzles to stop any leakage. I’ve been using The Vanilla shampoo and conditioner for a while now but it dries my hair out, but this right here is for me a colored woman with naturally thick curls."
39,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,SO AMAZING,"I normally have many different shampoos and conditioners, some better than others. I have curly hair and my hair always wants more moisture and this shampoo and conditioner is amazing.Recently I had to use a color corrector to get a weird color out of my hair and after I rinsed it out I was supposed to shampoo it twice and condition and I was going to put a mask on my hair. Even after I shampooed my hair twice my hair felt super soft and after the conditioner it felt even softer, I debated doing the mask because this shampoo and conditioner is so moistururizing but did it anyways.Moral of the story this stuff is amazing and I think im done with trying out different products and that this one will be my forever brand!! Thank you guys!!!"

My hair was dry, brittle and wasn't growing. I was spending over 100 a month on special shampoos trying to fix my hair. I've been using this shampoo now for a year. My hair has grown, it's not breaking hardly at all and it looks SOOOOOO much healthier.I LOVE this product. Thank you so much!!!!"
41,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry hair!!,"My daughter has impossibly dry hair and this magic solution actually gets moisture into her strands. She has type 2A hair and we were concerned that it might be too much moisture and make her look oily, but it does not. Her hair is glossy, soft, and manageable.Her one complaint is that the conditioner needs to sit on her hair longer than she likes (5-7 minutes)."

I've used this for a month and have noticed the shedding and breakage from my very thick shoulder length hair I used to experience dwindled to a few stray hairs being in my comb. My hair is soft, smells good and the tangling I experience when shampooing I don't have that problem anymore. I have relaxed henna treated hair and I wash my hair every week and it has maintained my henna color and increased it's vibrancy. Just not sure I can afford to purchase this stuff twice a month(I run out of product fast) at those prices."
43,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best shampoo and conditioner I’ve ever used,"First off, the scent is wonderful. I washed my hair and left the conditioner in for 3-5 minutes, rinsed and put my hair in a towel. I let my hair air dry through the night and when I woke up the next day, my hair still smells AMAZING. Like I’m talking the best it’s ever smelled. It’s pretty much a vanilla daydream I’m currently living in.Second, my hair is sooooo soft. I recently damaged it pretty badly (my hair has always been blonde) and this set has left my hair feeling like a virgin again.It’s lusciousIt’s curly somehow? I never knew it could do thatIt’s done left my head and gotten it’s own degree at Harvard.This shampoo and conditioner will be the ONLY set that I use for the rest of my life.Just buy it!

My favorite shampoo and conditioner from them is the almond milk. I wanted to try the black vanilla one this time & damn did I get unlucky. When I opened the package it’s like it wasn’t sealed properly, was open & dried over like it was sitting there in the warehouse like that. So sad & inconvenient. I had to get a replacement so hopefully this doesn’t happen again cuz I really do love carols daughter products."

However..,"Well, the product itself is GREAT! The smell is oh so amazing .. the softness it spot on. My ONLY BUT biggest complaint, is now after ordering this once.. it arriving and neither bottle would open from the top. After trying several try’s the lid broke. We could only access it if we twisted the And used it that way. So I ordered another order same stuff and got another set the same way same malfunction. The product itself is great the bottle is horrendous now not only have I got two sets of conditioner and shampoo bowls with pumps that do not work and now broken lids.. the bottles get dumped so easily and you loose over half the product :-/"

Made my scalp itchy & dry. Also, it's very thick, like honey. A little goes a long way, but it's so thick that it gets stuck in the dispenser and you can't pump it out. I had to open each bottle to use. Tried twice to give it a chance, but it was bothering me. Gave it 2 stars for at least trying to be a more natural product."

When I washed her hair with this it seems as though it stripped all her natural oils out of her hair and the smell was awful. I’m very disappointed in the results.

It is constantly dry. In the past I had to just weight my hair down with oils & creams just to make it manageable.  All those products left a film/residue on my scalp & my hair was still dry.  Since I started using Carol's shampoo & condition, my hair is soft, and hydrated for the first time ever. I also use the 4-in-1 combing cream. I love it so much I bought a set for family members that have hair imbalances and they love it as well."

Smells amazing, my hair and scalp feel sooooo clean. It’s definitely a difference from my other well known brands.I’m just kind of disappointed with the conditioner, I need to bring wide tooth comb in shower with me to untangle my hair. I’ve never ever had to do that before and that’s the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. I will continue to purchase this. Hubs even loves the way my hair smells."

I thought the product wasn't going to be as good as people said in the reviews because of the price but since I am one year natural and I'm still experimenting on products that work on my hair I decided to go for it and this is literally one of the best decisions I've made in my life LOL I was not disappointed the moisture was incredible it makes my hair crazy soft which made me shook because no other products other than tgin Miracle Mask and Creme of Nature products make my hair soft and moisturize if you have a similar issue like I do you should just buy this product go for it and the price is so worth it

My hair and scalp feels much cleaner than any  of the other products I have ever used. It gives my scalp a tingling feeling when shampooing.  I can tell the difference in how it gives my hair a much cleaner feel.  The moisturizer detangles and makes my hair softer therefore making it easier to manage.  It smells really great.  I am very very happy with this shampoo and conditioning.

My hair is also shiny, and it smells amazing.  The only draw back is I have to use a lot of the product to get my hair really lathered, but that is more to do with my coarser, more curly hair type and not the product itself.  Anyway I would definitely recommend this product."
61,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Average,"Hard to get a good lather without a lot of product. Conditioner hard to remove from bottle also, and the top broke. This is a brand i love but for the price and quality of this particular hair care duo, will not purchase again. The scent should be stronger as well, only lasted while showering, but not in clean hair. I hope they use the feedback to improve."

They love it and they rave about how good their hair feels and how shiny their hair gets. Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the company won’t replace damaged products.

I have shoulder length thin blonde hair (never color treated) and it makes my hair soft and smells amazing. This gift pack came with the product leaking and the box ruined.

It made me feel sick. It's winter and I had to open the bathroom window cuz it's giving me headache and triggered my sinusitis every time I use it. This product is probably good for people who only want to wash their hair once a week. I had to rinse my hair too many time. Even when I'm about to go to sleep I rinsed my hair again because the smell makes me feel nauseous.

I use the Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla leave in conditioner and I love it. But this shampoo and conditioner set is awful. The shampoo seems to have a hard time coming out of the pump and it’s the consistency and color of honey. The conditioner seemed fine and smelled good- however it did no conditioning whatsoever.

The shampoo contains some kind of chemical that made my scalp EXTREMELY itchy. Strangely, not the conditioner though. I tested by just using the conditioner on one day, and just the shampoo a few days later just to make sure.  It's a shame because the conditioner is a fantastic detangler and my curls look good and all, but stay away from the shampoo if your skin is sensitive to perfumes or harsh chemicals."

My hair is dry and unmanageable when I use these products. I did better using Suave Moroccan Infusion. So my hair is thick, but fine and pretty straight. I also used it on my curly haired daughter and it really does not work for her. Her hair has become a brittle mess.  I gave 3 stars because it's likely a good product, just not for me."

After spending 20-30$ per bottle I needed something more affordable. Let me tell you... I was skeptical of going to a more “drug store” brand. I couldn’t be more happy. This has made my hair thicker, stronger, less frizzy and SOOO SOFT! I was not a fan of the scent after smelling the bottle but I LOVEEEE the way it makes my hair smell. I will not only be repurchasing these items but will be trying more items from carols daughter. 10/10!!!"

The shampoo does not lather enough for me which is something I like to see when washing my hair. The conditioner is not very good, in my opinion, for my hair.

They just didn't perform well for me."

It has real vanilla in it.  It doesn't contain any of the harsh chemicals that regular shampoo does.  If you are looking for a natural shampoo, I highly recommend this stuff!  The pump dispenser is a different story.  I absolutely hate the bottles this comes in!  My husband figured out how to make it work, but it is beyond me!  So good luck, and the shampoo has leaked upon shipment every single time!  That is why I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars."

537,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sulfate-Free Holy Grail,"I have been on the lookout for a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner combo that (a) actually works and (b) doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  This hits both of the marks tenfold.  I have very fine hair that is weighed down easily by products with any sort of buildup or gets super static-y and flat if it strips the hair too harshly; it's hard to find a happy medium.  This is the perfect in-between.  I also usually steer clear of conditioners as my hair does not need any help in the oil department, but when I use this (mid-shaft to ends only), it doesn't weigh it down but moisturizes for very healthy looking hair.  My hair feels clean, shiny and still has body and movement.  It smells SO good too!  Can't beat the gift set price either; both products individually are around $10 at any store. Highly recommended."

I am a Caucasian senior citizen lady with extremely sensitive scalp and skin.  I also have many intolerances to various shampoos and their formulations as I have scalp psoriasis and many allergies.  Carol's Daughter's shampoo has always left my hair in excellent condition, beautiful and shiny, and have never had a sensitivity problem.  Excellent product and price.  I am used to paying $11 for the shampoo alone at a supposedly discount store.  I wish Carol's would develop some kind of hair spray and/or hair gel with a similar gentle formulation.  A deodorant would be wonderful too as I have the same problems with them.  Thanks!"
659,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for coarse textured hair,I have been trying to find a new shampoo and conditioner since my current brand is ridiculously priced. I wanted to love this shampoo and conditioner. It smells great and I love the pumps. I also feel that the price is very reasonable. However it left my hair really dry and feeling like hay. I am a little confused because it says it's good for dry and brittle hair. I guess it's just not for my hair type.

As for the quality of the products, so far I have no complaints. Shampoo and Conditioner both work great on my dry super-fine hair."

My only gripe is that the conditioner I received top came broken but I replaced it with one that I previously owned as a quick fix. It was most likely due to damage during shipping.
663,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,mucus consistency,I have purchased this product various times in retail stores and decided to purchase through amazon. I was VERY disappointed by the quality of both the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo had a mucus consistency and the conditioner did NOT moisturize my hair as well as the product that I would buy in store. The SMELL (which is the best part about the shampoo/conditioner) was NOT like the original vanilla at all. Smelled lightly of vanilla. I will definitely buy in store from now on.

But since I started using this product, my hair has been silky smooth and doesn’t look like the janitor threw his dirty mop on top of my head. I’m able to keep my hair down and I’ve never been so happy with it before. I typically hate my hair. But after using this stuff, I did the subscribe and save. And I won’t be using anything else."

717,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,The ABSOLUTE BEST SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER FOR *EXTREMELY* COURSE HAIR.  I am in l💗ve!!,"I absolutely had to post this review because I am amazed at how soft, clean, fresh, and moisturized my natural *extremely* course hair is this morning as a result of washing it and conditioning it with the Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla...  I will NEVER, and I mean NEVER use another shampoo and conditioner on my hair for the rest of my life (I am not exaggerating) and so I hope they never stop making this.  Understand that I have had natural (unprocessed/untreated) for 2 1/2 years and have tried everything from Creme of Nature Botanicals, to Cantu, to Mizanni (I do love Mizanni products, however, it still has never made my hair feel so moisturized and cottony soft), to Pantene... to just so many other products and nothing compares.  So if anyone is on the fence about buying this, please take it from someone who has extremely course hair that is about 14 inches long from the root (so imagine how I dreaded washing and combing my hair out).  This shampoo and conditioner from Carol's Daughter makes me look forward to washing my hair because it smells so fresh and it has improved the texture of my hair in just one use. It makes my hair very manageable. I can comb right through it."
718,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,"CD virgin and my first time was AMAZING! Great shine, but shampoo might strip hair a bit!","I did say too much looking around for an affordable yet quality shampoo and conditioner. So I checked out carol's daughter for awhile (lol) and after reading reviews I decided to try A few of the CD products! I am so happy that I did because I loved how this made my hair feel and look. Even the shampoo is very moisturizing! I got the curls foam stuff, the orange hair mask, and the green restorative leave in stuff in junction with the S&C.I have seen incredible shine in it and noticed results right away ❤️ Today my hair looks kind of frazzled; yesterday seemed a little dry and today it was more so, but I did do a lot of scrunching so that may have been a part of it. I've been using the hair mask as well as the S&C so that would be crazy if it were from the wash.I've read people saying this stuff could be stripping your hair, and it might be true. I'll report back after a month. I shampoo and condition 5 times in a week. I'll try skipping the shampoo and see if it makes a differenceThe shampoo trigger thing is either stuck on the shampoo or it sucks- it operates way more rigidly than the conditioners so maybe it was busted."

This is my first time using it and I fell in love.

I have dried curly hair and this product makes it easy to manage."

I was using products that were too heavy for my hair and my curls were suffering badly. After doing some research, I realized I have low porosity hair. I read that this product could be a good fit for my hair type. It turns out that it surely is! I love the smell, the texture, the slip, and the way my hair dries without product in it. This picture is literally what my hair looked like after my hair dried with only using the shampoo and conditioner. There is no other product in my hair."

OMG, this shampoo and conditioner is amazing. It had my hair feeling soft and the conditioner immediately detangled my hair with me just rubbing my fingers through it. Once I blow dried my hair, it had a lot of shine and softness to it. This has made me even more excited about washing my own hair. Carol’s Daughter is about to save me some money. I’m now going to switch to every two weeks."

I have super fine naturally blonde wavy hair that I bleach even lighter and sometimes dye fun colors. Since it is so fine and then I process it the damage is starting to take its toll.

766,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Severe Hair Loss,I used this shampoo and conditioner set for about 3 weeks. First I noticed my hair being noticeable drier but chalked it up to the weather. Got a hair cut to trim off split ends that I thought was negatively impacting the health of my hair. It wasn’t until my boyfriend had to sweep the floors multiple times a week due to the amount of hair that was piling up. Clumps of hair! Than I looked At recent pictures and we could tell how thin and patchy my hair had become! I’m 27 years old my family has the luck of good head of hair on both sides. My diet and routine hasn’t changed. The only thing that I changed was the terrible decision to try this “healthy” shampoo.. do NOT try. Your hair could fall out at an alarming rate!

769,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner Set For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, Sulfate Free Shampoo and Hydrating Hair Conditioner (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Great Scent & Packaging; Formula not for me,"For context, I have thick hair with a pretty normal scalp. My hair washing routine is pretty no-frills; my hair isn't damaged or color treated, and my scalp isn't sensitive. I wash my hair every other day. Up until this point, I'd been using bar shampoo, so I was already accustomed to shampoo that didn't have a bunch of sulfates and silicone.This duo of products smells really nice, and the packaging is fantastic, but the formulas just didn't do much for me. My hair feels dry and looks dull. These quarantine days has me caring a less about the efficacy of my beauty products, so I'll stick with it and use this up, but I'll probably be treating myself to a hydrating hair mask at the end of it."

It smells good, her hair is soft and not as frizzy as other products we’ve tried (some much more expensive). The thing that ruined the experience for me was the bottles themselves. The pump on the shampoo requires about 20 pumps to get enough product out for a average head of hair. The pump on the conditioner broke off at the first wash. So, I now have uncapped bottles on the side of the tub just waiting to slip in the tub and spill out. Putting the pumps back in to store them was very inconvenient and just makes a huge mess when I need to pull them back out each time. I WISH they had a simple flip top or even twist off cap."

0,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",1.0 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE FOR 3B - 4C HAIR,"It nearly destroyed my hair in just one month. I bought all of it too. I bought the moisturizer/ leave-in, I bought the curl cream and this shampoo and conditioner. I have 3C hair and I would not recommend this for anyone with 3B - 4C. Essentially, I’m saying this ain’t for us sisters. It dried my hair out, it caused hair loss, split ends and other damage. My hair gets matted after ONE nights sleep (even with silk cap). My hair is brittle and dry right now. I have also had horrible dandruff for two weeks, which is very unusual for me.I’m truly, truly upset I used this product for just one month and have the damage that I do. I shaved my head in 2012 and have been natural since. So I am very particular about my hair and products. I typically use “As I Am” products and I HIGHLY recommend that brand. DO NOT USE CAROLS DAUGHTER.I threw what was left of these in the trash. I thought about putting them in the guest bathroom but that would just be evil. Please don’t put this on your curls and coils. It’s going to take months for my hair to rejuvenate and recover. Literally after 2 days of discontinuing the use of Carols Daughter, my hair is starting to feel less brittle and hold moisture."

2,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,I stand by this product!,"The first time I used this shampoo/conditioner duo IT SAVED MY LIFE. I had made the poorest of choices to save money and go to the hair cuttery for a revamp on my platinum blonde dye....The woman bleached my hair TWICE in one sitting and my hair was DESTROYED. I scoured the first drug store I came too and read every bottle label for moisturizing products and finally landed on this gem. Honest ingredients, reasonable price and most importantly - IT WORKS. My hair immediately began to bounce back from the damage after just one use and it never broke or split. Seriously shook by the wonders it did. And, although L'Oreal purchased them, it's still a black-owned company that aims their products towards black women so it's great to support that. But, like me, you definitely don't need to be black to enjoy this product!"

This looks like a legit carols daughter store but it's not. I have the real shampoo and compared it. The fake one smells more like chemicals. The color is completely off, and the label looks like a watered down printed copy. The dispenser pump is also a slightly different size. I have been buying carols daughter from target for years. Will not be putting this in my hair."

I am truly not one to leave reviews or complain about products.That said, this shampoo seriously TANGLES your hair as you put it in. Suddenly every time I washed my hair I was having to deal with serious knots! I heard this happened for others and decided to endure but ever since switching from Carol's Daughter to a new brand, idk why I ever endured that pain. It makes your hair feel so dehydrated while showering and even after.For context, I am mixed, black, indian, and italian, with loosely curly hair, but I need good shampoo and conditioner to manage it.I used this after the devacurl scandal, looking for a good replacement. I used it for about 6 months and went through lots of bottles, and I didn't realize how bad it was for my hair until I stopped using it. I went through soooo much conditioner as well which was the worst part. To combat the tangling that the shampoo caused, I was having to buy 2 or 3 bottles of conditioner per bottle of shampoo which was horrible. I think I was able to ignore the flaws of Carol's because of the price-point, especially coming from devacurl which is pricey, and the reviews seemed good so I figured it wasn't too good to be true, but it was.I genuinely just want people to know the struggles cause finding a good formula is hard. I currently am using a much better product which made me realize that my hair can be nice and soft and manageable. I don't want to give the name because I don't want this review to seem fake or planted, but I definitely wanted anyone who has these hair struggles with this product to realize that it's probably time to move on from it!"
5,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not effective, drying, heavily scented","Their monoi formula is much more effective when it comes to strengthening and conditioning damaged / over-processed hair. This product left my hair course / stiff and has a heavy heavy scent. It smelled really bad out of the bottle, like a strong cheap perfume, but as I used it in the shower I picked up some more natural notes of almond and possibly coconut, but after I rinsed it out the only sent that was left was the artificial perfume. The scent was so strong even after it dried I received multiple comments from people in the office throughout the day about it, people thought I was wearing a very strong and unpleasant smelling baby powder based perfume. I like this company's products, and even though its more than twice the price, I will stick with the monoi formula. I thought I could save some money with this since it's the same company and promises similar results, but the products couldn't be more different."
6,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to be working for me,"Been using carols daughter hair products ONLY as well as rinsing my hair with ACV and my curls are looking super healthy now. After so much damage I did to my hair, I basically went from long kinky curls, to SOME curls, and mostly just waves in my hair and it looked horrible! But I seriously ONLY USE Carols daughter products, such as gel and leave in conditioner to take my curls. I hope that this like other really good products on Amazon don't go away! I hate finding something that works and then not being able to purchase here anymore. This shampoo and conditioner is gentle enough to use every day, which I still don't, but you could, if you use hair products to style."

8,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Try this product white people LOL,"Did that get your attention? *SMILE*  This company's products might appear to be primarily for AA females, but let me assure you that this product set is fantastic.  I am a WF, and my hair is really very healthy.  It tends to get a little dry after I get a color or highlight, for a while.  I have started using these products, after having bought the gift set.  They leave my hair super soft, and I use them daily or every other day.  I have noticed a reduction in frizz.  I love these products.  The smell is almond milky, if that makes sense.  Its not my favorite scent, tbh, but its not bad at all,  and its not strong.  And it does not linger on my hair after drying.  I would def recommend this product to anyone, of any ethnicity."

I purchased this attempting to support Black businesses, which I found out it is not Black owned, and this product literally took out ALL of my hair.  At a salon where I went to try to repair the damage, the stylists reported countless customers who had the same thing happen to them after using this product. I also read the reviews too late and discovered many other customers saying the same thing. This product ruined my hair and it may never be the same. This product needs to be taken off the market and this company sued with a class action lawsuit. Amazon should allow a rating of 0 or negative because that is what they deserve."

I used it about 4 times and each time I noticed my hair would come out in clumps. This last time I washed, I used my old shampoo and conditioner just to see if there would be a difference in hair shed. It was a HUGE DIFFERENCE! My hair barely went down the sink which proved to me it was Carol's daughter almond shampoo and conditioner that was making me lose a lot of my hair. When I asked my sister about it she said she stopped using hers because her hair came out too! I'm throwing this stuff away asap! I won't even donate it, nor will I refer this brand to anyone else!

My hair did feel light and soft. BUT the smell is awful and overpowering. I read some reviews that said it was like ""cheap perfume""... Not how I would describe it. I'd say it's more of a public restroom soap smell (not the nice pink bubblegum smelling one) . Kind of looked like it too. I could smell it all day. It even stuck to my pillow case. Immediately after I got out of the shower I had tried spritzing a leave in conditioner to help mask the smell, wasn't enough. It might be worth it some, not me. Gave it 3 stars bc I didn't give it a fair shot."

16,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not moisturizing,"I attached 2 pictures here, the one where my hair has more individual waves is without this product and just my regular routine (no product just wash and diffuse) the other picture is after using this product, I was excited because my hair tends to be dry so I wanted something that could add moisture without all the unnecessary stuff in it. BUT the shampoo was drying, it made my hair feel more coarse than usual and I had a lot of hair coming out  More than the normal amount for me, but I thought maybe after the conditioner it will feel better ? It says apply generously so I did and left it on about 10 minutes, rinsed out , and then got out and diffused, my hair was just flat, barely any wave to it, doesn’t feel moisturized. The only parts of my hair that feel softer are my roots because I didn’t apply any of this product there also it DOES smell like old lady perfume so if you don’t like strong smells like that it’s not for you.. that’s pretty much it. Might work for other people but not for me."

I have also been dying and highlighting my hair for years. It’s become dry and tangles constantly. This shampoo and conditioner solves all my problems!!

I was using other Carol's daughters products and i was in love with them. So, i wanted to give this one a try.  Unfortunately:It made my hair extremely DRY. It created more tangles than if I were to use no product at all. Having curly hair, it was upsetting having to pull my hair trying to untangle my hair. I have pretty sensitive skin, including my scalp. I developed dandruff. I it was so uncomfortable and painful.I wish I had the same experience as others who have given good reviews but unfortunately I did not. I gave the shampoo and conditioner a week, hoping that my hair reacted differently but every time i showered I was scared for my hair. it felt damaged and I am pretty sure it cause my hair fall off more than normal.Immediately returning."

It reminds me of the smell of a new born baby freshly bathed. The fragrance and soft but lasts for days. My daughter is constantly getting compliments on how nice her hair smells from those in close proximity to her.  The Shampoo seems to be a bit more fragrant than the conditioner but both are great. The moisturizing component works well enough but could be a little better especially for those with dry or brittle hair. Still by far my Fav
24,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Smell. Great Feel.,"Carol’s daughter was my first step into natural shampoo and conditioner. It has definitely transformed me from using a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner. Unfortunately not many hair products are anchored towards African-American men and this product helped make washing my hair easier. I mean, the conditioner has 100% made picking my hair so much less of a hassle as well as washing it. I can feel my fingers go straight through without getting tangled in any naps. I love it.  Not only me, but my bf is not even African American (Caucasian) and he uses it because he liked it. Go figure."

I discovered the Carol’s Daughter products a few years ago now and have not turned away since.  Not only are the ingredients incredibly nourishing, but they keep your hair healthy, strong and manageable. My favorite of the line has been the Almond Milk. It keeps my hair free of dryness, breakage, dandruff while including manageability, and a wonderful scent that lingers for days after a shampoo, conditioner and leave in. I highly recommend giving their line of products a try. They’re most certainly worth the money while providing nourishment and health to your hair."

I'm mixed. and my hair is too! After having used this set for about 6 months now, i seriously can't believe how great and luxurious and perfect my hair looks! I didnt think just shampoo and conditioner could ""doo"" that!!! I work outside everyday in Colorado where the sun constantly burns and dries out your hair. Carol's Daughter has restored my hair to luxury!!!!"

She colors her hair a lot and well her hair was looking unhealthy, once she started using Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate-Free Shampoo and Conditioner, The huge difference in her hair was almost instant! after a few days her natural curls were curly again. The smell is amazing. So pleased with this buy will be getting Carol's Daughter products again."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"Gave as a gift, and she absolutely loved it. The smell is divine. I myself have used this brand, and my hair feels softer afterwards. Despite some people believing otherwise, Carol’s Daughter is a great natural brand for everyone; my friend is white with very long, very thin hair and has already noticed a difference, while I’m white/Latino and this works excellent for my coarse-thick hair as well."
30,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",2.0 out of 5 stars,Changed owners=changed formula!?,"I use to love Carol's Daughter products, but I've noticed a difference past few times I've bought from them. At first I thought my scalp was just getting dry from weather change, or that maybe I needed to use colder water when washing my hair. Come to find out they've recently sold their company and I've noticed the quality drop significantly. It was the shampoo and conditioner creating buld up and dry scalp! I never had this problem before, I tried using another brand and didn't have a problem. I've talked with my other curly haired friends and they told me they've experienced the same issues!"
31,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good For The Price,"A good set for the price. I have dry, thick, yet fine, gray hair that is short. These work well for what I need which is moisture. The conditioner isn't heavy by any means, but substantial and the shampoo is creamy. Not a wild almond scent fan but I didn't get it for that. If anyone remembers the Vidal Sassoon shampoo/conditioner of old, it smells just like that. Definite almond but it doesn't linger."
32,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really does repair hair!,"Not too fond of the smell, it smells just like the hand soap they use in public restrooms lol.  BUT after using this product only once, my hair is so much softer and already repaired from years of damage due to straightening every single day!  I did not find that the smell was too strong or anything, and after washing it just smells like regular clean hair without any strong smell.  I do like shampoo to have a lot of extra fruity smells, but those are generally the ones with all that extra crap in it that's bad for your hair.  I believe this shampoo smell is just a natural almond milk smell, nothing over the top at all.  I will probably use this shampoo/conditioner forever!"
33,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing products,This is the second scent I've tried and this one isn't the best smell? It's a very strong almond and it does linger for two days it seems. The product is great though. The shampoo really lathers so these bottles will last longer than expected. You'll feel a noticeable different right away. Definitely recommend the brand.
34,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm in love!!!,"I'm a HUGE fan of this product!! I absolutely love the scent, it's really nice without being overpowering at all. I've noticed that it's really helped in the overall itchiness that I get on my scalp. I'm sensitive to some products and I've noticed that I haven't had an issue with this shampoo and conditioner. It's my favorite shampoo and conditioner right now!!"
35,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",1.0 out of 5 stars,dont like at all,i bought this based on reviews and im trying a new treatment on my natural kinky hair but this is a no go my hair feels like its stripped of all moisture when washed then i deep condition it and it still leaves my hair rough it claims it doesnt have sulfate in it but it seems to be untrue will not buy again
36,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",4.0 out of 5 stars,5 star with less scent!,"My hair is fried and has broken off above my shoulders. (Over processed) This duo is wonderful for my hair and makes it feel amazing. The only downside is the smell. I wish companies would realize that people with allergies need products that won't blow your head off with scent. A much milder version would be great. I also bought the spray but cannot tolerate the smell enough to use it. Otherwise, this is a very nice product"
37,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s okay but not for damaged hair.,This product is really good but not for intense moisture. I much preferred there deep conditioning treatment. The smell is amazing but doesn’t last long after you rinse out the product. I would say for healthy hair this is amazing at maintaining the health of the hair. However for people with more damaged hair like mine this doesn’t do much.
38,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth It,This product exceeded my expectations...I wasn’t sure how good it would be at repairing my damaged hair but I have only used it once and my hair is the smoothest it’s been in awhile. I’ve never heard of this brand but I thought the price was reasonable so I went for it and I’m so glad I did. It’s the best hair product I’ve had in a long time and I can’t believe the results with such a decent price. I would recommend this product to anyone with extremely dry hair.
39,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",2.0 out of 5 stars,Initially felt good,"It initially felt great lathering my hair but after washing the shampoo and conditioner out, my hair felt really dry and brittle. Then it was really flaky. I had to rewash my hair with my old stuff. I chucked it immediately because I was passed the 30 day return. Never buying again."
40,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE! Fekkai shea butter and full gloss dupe,"I am in LOVE with how my hair looks after I use this. In the shower, it smells strongly of almonds (odd reference, but like the Great Wolf Lodge shampoo?) and lathers enough to feel like my thick and oily hair gets a good clean. The conditioner is smoothing and silicon-y feeling, but it leaves my hair looking soft and clean. When I air or blow dry, my hair is silky, voluminous, and tangle free. It looks good undone or styled--overall, it is a very versatile shampoo that is a good dupe for more expensive versions."
41,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Like it. Good price point and quality.,"I have wavy hair that doesn't like humidity and is currently postpartum aka falling out.Obviously, I'm trying to eat healthy and take right supplements but this shampoo/conditioner duo makes my hair (whatever is left) almost silky and pretty manageable because as a new mom it's really hard to do anything and hair during covid is definitely not on my priority list."
42,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very strong smell but worth it for the result,Have to admit I don't like the way this smells. You know the way a public bathroom smells? Or the way those portable bathrooms smell? Yeah that's what it reminds me of. The scent is very strong but I LOVE how it treats my hair. Literally made my hair feel like silk. I'll definitely try other products from this brand. Bye bye drugstore hair care!!!!!
43,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not for me!,"I bought these for my daughter since she has very curly hair and more often than not it gets frizzy. I didn't see a difference in her hair while using this shampoo and conditioner but it does smell great. I like that it's s not a heavy or greasy conditioner. They both come well packaged in a box separate from any other items(if you ordered multiple items) in case they pop open they won't spill all over everything. They are good products just not what I was looking for, I was expecting more since they ARE a bit pricey."

I also got the hair mask, which is separate but I love just as much and recommend also!"

First off, they do a fantastic job of packaging. I’ve bought three different orders and none of them are damaged in any way. Second, the product itself is just fanatic and more than the products I was using before, a little goes a long way. I do think it’s important to mention that the scent is very strong. The almond milk smells exactly like a bottle of almond extract and that took some getting use to, but now I really enjoy how long the smell lasts in my hair."

63,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",3.0 out of 5 stars,Honest review from a real customer,I got this shampoo hoping it would help revive my hair. But instead my hair doesnt feel soft and silky. It feels very dry and it is hard to comb through. I like the scent. I like the bottles. But I do not like how my hair is starting to thin more with using this product. I am going to go try Gardiner whole blends revive honey instead of this. I just dont like the way it leaves my hair more messed up. This is a real customer. I bought the product February 7th so I been using it for a entire month. Now I will search for a better hair product.

65,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft hair,Leaves my hair soft and shiny when I use the leave in conditioner. I have sensitive skin and this seems to be the only hair product that doesn't irritate the rest of my body when I rinse in the shower. The conditioner leaves buildup so I dont often apply to my scalp just the ends. I've tried a couple other scents in this brand but this is the only one I've seen great results with.
66,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY. IT BURNS.,"Not sure who this product is for. I bought this set along with the vanilla scent and it burns my clap, both shampoo and conditioner. Thought it was the set reacting with another product I used so I tried it again and got the same result. It also strips your hair of any possible moisture, left it feeling squeaky and stiff. Did a little research and found an entire forum of people complaining about the same issue, some even said it made their hair fall out."

I've buzz cut my own hair then relaxed it for years - to get that texturized look.  I recently decided to go natural and see what my hair does. The shampoo makes my hair and scalp feel squeaky clean. The conditioner helps separate my short little curls.  The only 'negative' thing I could add is that the conditioner lathers like a shampoo, and turns my hair white.  I usually blot it with a towel to fix it.  So far so good."

The conditioner did little to revive the dryness. I use other carols product but this one I’m not satisfied with. Also compared to the lavender one this line has I’m not thrilled with the scent on here. So overall it’s a no for me. Also would like to note that my hair is going through transition so I’m very mindful of what I put in it. It could be that this line just isn’t for transitions or for my hair who knows lol.

474,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT FOR RELAXED HAIR,"If you have relaxed black people hair DO NOT BUY THIS, if I knew L’Oréal took over this company I would have never purchased this. Even though I called to clarify if this is good for relaxed black hair and was told yes, I am living the consequences now. I don’t know what’s worst this or the monoi leave in conditioner.. I HATE THIS AND THE HAIR MASK AND THE MONOI LINE.. my hair is so damaged I can cry..  I went by a hair dresser and she has treated my hair to the gods , my hair was horrific after using most of the carol daughters line, but after getting it treated by the salon, I had to wash my hair at home and I ran out of my regular great stuff and I had no choice but to use my almond milk line. So I gave it another try, and guess what ? I nearly ran over the bottles with a car, I almost threw them in the oven to watch it burn slowly. My hair is DESTROYED .. I’m never wasting my $150 on carols daughter products AGAIN"
475,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will just purchase from target or walmart,"I’m too disgusted to use this. Besides the delivery being late, it arrived used. Like someone shampooed and conditioned their hair with the product prior to shipping it to me. I’m a fan of this brand so I know the product is great but I will just continue purchasing it from target as this is super disgusting not to mention that their is actually hair on the side I don’t the bottle. I just really can’t believe this"
476,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the conditioner more than the shampoo,"This is a very good product if you want to get rid of product build up in your hair and scalp, which the shampoo does a good job at but once it's washed out, my hair feels rubbery(?). As if all the softness has been stripped away. The conditioner however restores the softness and moisture to my hair. I also use it as a co-wash in between was days. It's really nice and the scent is pleasant.The results are further enhanced by the hair masque (Almond Milk) which I reviewed also.This didn't get a full 5 stars because the shampoo strips too much of my hair's (4c) integrity."
477,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hair feels better,"My hair looks and feels so healthy now that I've been using this for a few months now. The first time though, because I was so used to sulfates and silicone fillers in my hair, there was a transition period. Once my hair got used to the routine, I got compliments on my hair every time I went out. Should definitely try it out!"
478,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",1.0 out of 5 stars,Shampoo makes hair feel like hay,The shampoo made my already damaged hair feel super dry and knotted in the shower. I would put the conditioner in and try to rake my fingers through my hair and it would be super knotted because of the shampoo. I don't understand why it makes my hair so much drier when it's supposed to help damaged hair and heal split ends. Literally can't use it - switched to Olaplex.
479,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great conditioner that smells horrendous.,"I loved what the conditioner did to my hair, and I love the product line, but the smell is god awful.

480,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",2.0 out of 5 stars,"First review, because it was that bad.","I bought the complete set of Carol's Daughter's Almond Milk shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner because I wanted to try something new & wanted to moisturize my hair. I have 3B hair and after using the shampoo it made my hair feel stripped and dry (while in the shower)! I thought the conditioner would be better and more moisturizing but it gave my hair the same feeling. Again, hoping for the best I tried the leave in conditioner to help detangle and it did nothing. The products all also smell like baby lotion, which is was really unflattering."
481,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",3.0 out of 5 stars,Defective pumps,Great product but the pumps are defective.

My hair is super soft and my curls are more defined because this shampoo and conditioner are very moisturizing. But just a heads up, the scent is not consistent, some purchases it’s perfect and other purchases it’s over powering."
483,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the cost,"I was not impressed with this product. The shampoo I guess is ok, but the conditioner was just lack luster, I really wanted to love it, but at its price point, it doesn’t even contend with pantene😐"
484,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked well, didn’t love the smell","This made my hair very soft and shiny and a little product goes a long way. However, I didn’t care for the smell. It’s a very strong artificial amaretto/almond scent. I will likely try this brand but a different scent next."
485,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Daily Damage Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Damaged Hair, Shampoo and Restoring Hair Conditioner with Shea and Aloe",5.0 out of 5 stars,OBSESSED,OBSESSED! I have bleach blonde very fine hair. I have searched for a shampoo and conditioner that moisturizes without leaving my hair heavy and oily. I didnt buy this product on Amazon but I did purchase it at a local beauty store and it has left my hair feeling so silky which hasn't happened in years despite the hundreds of dollars I have spent on sulfate free shampoo and conditioners. I highly recommend this product and hope that they continue selling them

I have a ton of thick, curly hair and it only takes 1.5 pumps of shampoo or conditioner to wash my hair. (Others were abt 3/4 pumps) I love the conditioner because it stretches the more you add a few splashes of water. It’s sulfate free, which means no drying the hair out!

0,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",2.0 out of 5 stars,Contains silicones,"Just just received my set of carols daughter goddess strength shampoo, conditioner, leave in cream and seven oil blend. I’m trying this after suffering from extensive damage to my hair by other “curly girl” products.  I have not used it yet, but I was happy to receive it so quickly and without any leakage.  At this point all I can say is that I’m very disappointed to see dimethicone in all the products except for the Oil. (See photos.)  Dimethicone isn’t the greatest thing to put on your hair or scalp, so I’m very hesitant to use it.  Dimethicone is a type of silicone that can make your hair look smooth, soft and silky initially but can build up on your hair and scalp, leaving a residue that blocks moisture from getting into the hair shaft, acting almost like waterproofing. Over time, hair not only appears dull, but it gets dehydrated and weak from lack of moisture. For this reason I’ve given these products only 2 stars even though I haven’t used them and will probably not use them."
1,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,This Hair Product Is Amazing.  It Exceeds Expectations.,"I tried this Carol's Daughter Goddess set to help me manage my naturally curly hair.  I followed the suggestion on the bottle to use the shampoo first, then the conditioner, then the oil, and lastly the leave-in cream conditioner. The Scent of the Shampoo blew me away. It is very fruity-scented and refreshing. I was pleased to find a little amount went a long way and the lather was a lot. I shampooed my hair twice, rinsed, then added the conditioner. I must say the softness and the slip were so pleasing. After rinsing my hair I added the oil, by pouring a little amount ion my hands and fingering it into my scalp and to the strands of hair. The final outcome was very shiny and well-moisturized hair that was so silky and soft to the touch. Moisture and control are what my hair needed most. I must say my style did last almost a full week.  I like playing with my hair so I was tempted to use the products again to see the improvement after a second use because the first use was beyond my expectations. You will not be disappointed."

   This product I'd super disappointing makes my hair itch and dry plus not to mention me and my wife's hair has been falling out constantly since the first use this company will be hearing from us 6 days ago my wife's hair was down past her shoulders now it doesn't even pass her neck"
3,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing Products,"I purchased the Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set in hopes it would work wonders on my 30-inch dry, white hair, but these were all very disappointing products. I really wanted to support Carol's Daughter and have purchased various products over the years; unfortunately, I've consistently been disappointed with them.  I don't like using products with any colorant at all because they tend to stain white hair.  The Goddess Strength products are beige, which isn't bad but certainly doesn't help brighten my hair.  My major complaint is that I've never used a product that dried my hair so!  I'm no hairdresser, but I do know that moisture is good for strengthening black women's hair.  My hair is a mixture of waves, kinks, and curls, and the last thing I want to do is use a product that dries it out. I'm older and my hair has thinned over the years as well, which is why I tried these 'strengthening' products.  However, I only used the products for a few weeks, and they appeared to cause more hair breakage, rather than less.  Back to Shea Moisture for me!"
4,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",1.0 out of 5 stars,Strong Oil,Wanted to like this collection. I have dry hair and scalp. I sampled the oil first. Put a few drops on my clean finger tips and gently rubbed onto my clean scalp. Within minutes it felt warm then hot. By one hour I had to shampoo it out of my hair and scalp. Too fearful to use other products.Maybe great for others just not me.
5,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",3.0 out of 5 stars,Shampoo and conditioner should be used frequently.,Mary TessmerMy hair is thining -  every time I wash it there is hair in the drain. I stopped coloring it because I want a light blond but I get this God-awful Army green. I go to the professional store to get my supplies.  I bought your product because I could put the oil and deep condition on my hair for hours but the texture is still ugly. My original hair is now white. It’s thining my hair instead of having very thick hair. I take oral chemo and  called for if dye was was causing hair loss and weird color results. They said no. Your shampoo cleans and lathers well.Your conditioner doesn’t make my hair silky soft.Your other products are good too.
6,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",1.0 out of 5 stars,Surprised that I was so disappointed,I'm surprised that this didn't work out for me as I like this brand. The scalp oil made my hair extremely greasy - I barely put any on the first try and won't be keeping it. Maybe I don't have the right type of hair but I have curly hair and somewhat dry and flaky scalp and this seemed to make my scalp even worse plus greasy hair. I am giving to my sister to see if it works better for her but I won't be buying this again and I'm warning her before she tries it.
7,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,Too much hair left in your brush???,"Going natural is liberating.  Really loving these products…Hair is soft, easy to comb and brush after washing and conditioning.  And I’m seeing way less hair loss in my brush.  That was the goal.  I also bought a moisturizing “butter” with the Goddess Strength line of products."
8,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,THIS PRODUCT IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH!!!,"This product is the absolute truth and it works during your first wash! My hair is extremely thick and kinky and this product tames. I used to take 30 minutes detangling my entire head. Now it takes 5-10 minutes max. My hair was moisturized throughout the entire wash process and I lost very little hair during detangling. My hair is extremely soft and even DAYS later, my hair is still moisturized without touching up or adding other stuff. I pushed my friend to try it and she already has her set. She said she never had an easier wash day. I highly recommend this product and I will be buying again. It smells amazing and your hair will definitely thank you for it."
9,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy hair!,My hair has never been happier! It feels just like it used to in my 20’s. Moisturized and full of life. After one use I did see significantly less hair breakage. It definitely delivers as promised. The sent is strong but to off putting for me since I’m a perfume junky. Hubby loves the scent too soo…The slip is amazing and left my hair supper manageable. Do yourself a favor and get the full system. It works. And a little goes a long way!
10,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",1.0 out of 5 stars,Leave-in Oil and Leave in Cream products TOO MUCH - in a bad way,"I have very thin and very fine hair, since using these products I have lost more hair, had nothing by grease running on my hair and the leave in cream just makes the hair feel gooey and clump together."
11,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably my favorite shampoo and conditioner!,"My only complaint with the products is the smell of it. I love how it cleans my hair and the after look. It’s not enough to style my curly poof ball, I have to still use some mouse or curl cream but much better then any other shampoo and conditioner I have used, worth the price as well.However I will be buying the shampoo and conditioner separately as I don’t use the scalp oil very often and don’t use much of the leave in conditioner! I find that my hair gets to oily (which is rare with me!!) if I use it!"

The scent lasts way longer then most shampoo. Don't use a lot of the leave in. A little goes a long way. Same with shampoo.

I have fine hair and was worried the oil and leave in conditioner might be too heavy, but is not. A little goes a long way and my hair is noticeable stronger- less breakage, and not coming out by the strand full in the shower."

87,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THIS. Caused MAJOR hair loss,"I’ve used the Carol’s daughter brand before but not this particular line. I usually use the black vanilla line and haven’t t had any problems.I used these products one time. ONE time. I begin to notice dryness and shedding within the first two days. I then began to notice and outrageous amount of shedding . I do not normally have any issues with shedding and keep up with my trims so I knew it was the products.I did not use them anymore. Quickly washed them out of my hair after continuing to see clumps of my hair fall out every time I touched it. I went from having thick healthy hair to having thin dry hair within a two weeks. My hair continued fall out to the point where I now have bald spots from the shedding. And Will have to go to the dermatologist to make sure this product did not damage my scalp.Please do not buy this. It is not worth the risk, and I plan on reaching out to corporate to complain because I see tht I am not the only one who has had this experience of hair loss based on the reviews I see here on Amazon and reviews on Google."
88,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,10 STARS ⭐️,The intoxicating smell and blend of ingredients are what I am loving about this product! This product markets exactly what it provides! My hair was incredibly soft and manageable after using the shampoo and conditioner alone and after applying the oil my hair felt healthy and well fed 🙌🏾 The leave in conditioner should give my edges the extra support it needs to withstand this Texas heat! My hair is more thin and I am excited to see what this blend of ingredients will continue to do to support the growth and strength of my hair over time!!
89,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",2.0 out of 5 stars,Ok if you can tolerate strong scents,"The smell is very strong, too strong for my liking. For my hair type, which is fine and curly, it did not really make a difference. After applying the oil after showering, then the cream, my hair, surprisingly, was stiff and dry a few hours later. Maybe it will work for other hair types."

99,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,1 use and you'll be loving your hair again!,"This has got to be the best brand I have found. Quite unexpectedly I might add. Found it searching for a completely unrelated product. I only need about a quarter size shampoo & conditioner to give my curls the strength and hydration it deperately needed. Also, frizz is non-existent when using this product. I do not have to use the oil though. It makes my hair greasy. The whole system works perfectly for my teenager. My daughter's hair is very curly and very, very dry. Both of our hair is prone to breakage. Even before we decided to use hair color. This product after 1 use has most definitely helped.  It has given me hope that managing our hair will be easier now. Although, i don't like the scent much.... It isn't that bad. I'm just sensitive with scents amd very picky with certain things. I can deal. It isn't terrible. Just makes me sneeze some. The moisture it gives starts with that shampoo. I have never in my life found a shampoo that makes my hair soft. Usually, it feels worse. I Love this stuff amd my daughter doesn't want to go w/o it. Great product."
100,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells AMAZING and Moisturizing!,"Does wonders for my biracial 3 year old's 3C - 4A curls! It also smells AMAZING. It is a great value for the price. I love every product in the bundle. The smell is long lasting and I just LOVE it. I use the shampoo once a week, the conditioner at every bath. I use the oil on the scalp once a week and the cream before his swimming lessons to protect his hair from the chlorine. Will definitely purchase this set again. I always loved Carol's Daughter and I used their almond set, black vanilla set, cococreme mask and hair oil spray but this is by far my favorite product line of theirs now."

110,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength 4 Full Size Products Hair Care Set - Sulfate Free Shampoo, Conditioner, Leave In, Scalp & Hair Oil Treatment- For Curly, Natural Hair",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"I have 4A hair, it has looser coils, it is thick but manageable in its natural state. I've been experiencing shedding and brittleness due to not properly taking care of my hair. I tried this conditioner and shampoo and immediately I could tell the difference! My hair did not shed once im the shower! It was soft and the comb slid right through after 1 wash!!  I couldn't believe it!  It feels stronger, stays soft and tangle free from wash to wash which is about 3 days.  The smell is different but not bad.  You can smell the vanilla but there is another ingredient/scent that is an acquired taste.  However, now, I enjoy the scent; it's my ""healthy hair"" smell.  If you're on he fence about trying this line, you should definitely do it!"

0,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,"My daughter is 7 and had the most awful hair to deal with. I could brush her hair an five mins later it would be super ratty again. She has fine hair but A LOT of hair. Everything I have tried never kept her hair soft and not as tangly. It would get so bad I would constantly have to have her hair in a braid to keep it from ratting up. The jelly to cream conditioner is an absolute must have in my house!! The shampoo is good but the conditioner is the star of the show. No more trying out masks or conditioners trying to figure out which one will keep her hair soft and a lot less tangly! I use it on my hair as well as my younger daughters hair and it works amazing!!! If you buy anything, buy the dream to jelly conditioner. My 7 year old has red hair an my youngest daughter and I have brown hair, all of us have fine hair but A LOT of hair that is beyond tangly… until now. I didn’t get paid to write this, I bought my own products and will continue to buy them!"
1,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",3.0 out of 5 stars,Both shampoo and conditioner are super weird!,Okay so the first time you put the shampoo in your hair it doesn't feel like anything is in your hair. So I fingered out that when you put the shampoo in then wash it off then put it in your hair for a second time it starts to lather up. This happened with both my hair (3c-4a) and my fiancés hair (4b-4c). I used the shampoo once and half the bottle is gone. So I don't like the shampoo. The conditioner on the other hand is pretty cool it does turn into a cream and makes your hair so soft. The only complaint I have is that the conditioner has these hard clean flakes in them they look and feel like plastic. It does dissolve into your hair but at first you would think its plastic.
2,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",2.0 out of 5 stars,Shampoo doesn't lather or foam at all,"I was pretty excited to try this as I've seen it recommended before. The smell is really nice, not super strong but very clean smelling.I tried to use the shampoo first, it was like putting water on my hair. The video shows it sudsing and foaming but it did neither. I tried rubbing it in my hands to lather it, nothing. So it basically just went on my scalp and rinsed off. I expected it to dry my hair a bit as a clarifying shampoo, but it didn't do that, it did nothing but tangle my hair. I used a different shampoo and went on to the conditioner.The conditioner on the other hand was fantastic in the shower, it felt a bit like Vaseline but I was able to comb my hair out of all the tangles caused by the shampoo. I wouldn't use it on top of my scalp because it's heavy and leaves a slight oily feeling, but it was perfect for my ends."
3,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",1.0 out of 5 stars,Just no,"I was really excited for this shampoo and conditioner because it sounded like exactly what I needed. I have really thick, low porosity, 4c hair and so I liked he idea of the applicator nozzle on the shampoo and a really thick conditioner that makes detangling easy. The problem is that nothing worked. The nozzle is actually great but you need a crap ton of shampoo for it to start foaming (in just two uses I’ve used a third of the bottle) and it leaves your hair feeling stripped after words. I’d be okay with the shampoo being a bit harsh if the conditioner did anything but it was almost worse than just your average condition that’s not even meant for kinky/coily hair. It barely added any slip, just like the shampoo I needed a ton of it, and when you rinse it out your hair still feels stripped. I gave this set a second try just to see if it was me being crazy but it’s just a complete and absolute no for me. If you’re looking for actual moisture just use the coco creme line from Carole’s Daughter cause this new one just isn’t it."

Best thing I ever did for my hair was finding this brand. I've gone between CD and other products and nothing compares to it. The only problem I have with their products is not liking the smell. This completely solved my problems. Smell is very fresh and not over powering either. Starting with the shampoo I love the bottle. Super easy to apply and while this did an awesome job cleansing my hair it didn't leave it feeling dry and stripped. On to the conditioner, I don't love the packaging (wish they would do the pump top like their other products) but it's something I can live with because it felt amazing the moment I put it in my hair. And after letting my hair dry naturally, my curls look amazing and feel so soft! Thank you Carol's Daughters! I'll never got to another brand. This literally saved my hair."
5,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",3.0 out of 5 stars,You can love or hate this product,"I'm white, with coarse and wavy/curly hair. I know that this product may not work for me because it's not quite formulated for my hair type. However, I do use other curly hair products that work just fine. So I'm going to rank this a 3 to try to be fair.The shampoo seemed fine, it was easy to distribute it through my hair and foamed up well. I can't remark on how my hair felt after because the conditioner that I followed with totally wrecked my hair. So I'm willing to give it another shot and use a different conditioner with it.Now for this conditioner, I had such high hopes because I need something that gives me a lot of slip so I can detangle in the shower and at first I thought it was going to be great. I love the scent of it and it made the tangles just melt out of my hair, it seemed to rinse out just fine and I thought everything was good. I let my hair air dry and it was so crusty and sticky after, I don't know if that's due to the glycerin in the conditioner or what, but I've never had a conditioner make my hair feel like that before."

   I love this product! My husband loves the smell even. I love the texture I get after use and how easily the conditioner detangles with you. It leaves the hair fluffy and light. I also purchased Carol's daughter leave in conditioner and hair oils. They all work amazingly together. This comes from a woman whom has never been able to properly manage her own hair. I'm thankful to have found these products."
7,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for thick tangled hair!,"I love this shampoo and conditioner so much! I wish I could hug who ever created it! My daughter is 12 and has EXTREMELY thick and long (past her bottom) hair with a curly under layer. Keeping her hair clean and detangled has always been a huge source of contention for us. During the summer, she swims daily and even though I keep her hair braided, she still comes out with terrible tangles. I saw a woman on tiktok using this conditioner on her daughter's tangled hair. We have literally tried everything with no success so I thought I'd give it a try. I am so sick of having to wash/condition a preteen girls hair! Our next step was cutting her hair, even though she loves it long so much. Y'ALL! THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! When she gets out of the pool a tangled mess, she puts the conditioner on her hair and is able to WORK HER OWN TANGLES OUT before she gets in the shower. The nozzle on the shampoo allows her to get it worked in all over- no more greasy patches on the underneath. It rinses out beautifully and doesn't leave her with a ton of build up. We are customers for life!! This is the best hair care product i have come across in a LONG time."
8,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome on textured hair!,"I've tried soooo many shampoo/conditioner combos on my daughter's hair over the years. This was the only one I've continued purchasing. Both the aloe and the rose smell nice. I'm not a rose fan but it's still pleasant. It cleans well and detangles beautifully. It's moisturizing however her hair drinks everything right up so still use whatever leave in moisturizer you use.The kicker is that it doesn't work for my hair. It's too heavy of a product for my thin, wavy hair. If you've got textured hair, its a game changer!"
9,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than any salon brand,"This stuff is absolutely amazing.  You don't have to use a lot of it and it's a miracle on my hair.  It feels good on the scalp, makes it so easy to detangle, and moisturizes perfectly.  I used to go through a bottle of Nexxus in 2 weeks.  A jar of this will last me 2 months and works so much better than anything I've ever used."
10,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,DETANGLES EVEN THE WORST TANGLES!,"My hair is very long, course, thick, tangles easily, and damaged. It takes a bit of product for me. It took 2-3 shampoos and conditions for me to notice the softness in my hair and it keeps my hair from getting greasy longer in between showering. Once you put the conditioner in your hair immediately starts to detangle and you can gel it getting softer. This stuff works amazing!!! I can detangle my almost dreaded knotted mess of a hair at times with my fingers in the shower while the conditioner is in! It’s amazing. It is pricey but best shampoo/conditioner combo I’ve ever used hands down."
11,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,True!!!,"I love everything about this product!!! I prayed for a product that will not knot up my natural African American hair. I usually wash three times with other products, but with this product, I washed only two times. The first wash striped the oil, grease and dirt off my hair. You will know this because your hair will feel dry! The second wash provided so much suds that I knew my hair was squeaky clean.  My hair is so soft and manageable. I used the honey grease which helped me put nice braids in my hair!!!! Perfect product!!!! My Forever!!"
12,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a must have for 4c low porosity hair,"So I was going to wait until I finished out my other products before buying this one but I'm glad I didn't. These products are everything my hair needed. Not only did it do what it was suppose to do, penetrating through my stubborn hair but it also uplifted my spirits to have a product that actually works.I washed my hair 3x with the shampoo to achieve the result I was looking for due to product overload from my previous hairstylist. The 1st wash my hair was super stubborn it barely retained the water, hence low porosity hair. I also detangled during shampoos. Anyway after the 3rd wash I rinsed my hair with hot water to prep it for the conditioner. I worked it through my hair as advised and my hair felt like it was being feed food. My hair was left feeling very soft and full. My coily hair literally tighten up and shrunk to its root. Also my hair was  glistening when all was said and done.It's a must buy. 10 stars !!!!Perfect for a wash and go!"
13,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great but has silicones.,I loved the smell of this stuff. It was so refreshing and summery and green that I couldn't stop smelling my hair and I was super in love with the way it made my hair feel. However I didn't notice that there's silicone in the conditioner which is a no go for my hair. I am sad because that means I can't really enjoy it the way I want because over time my hair will be made worse by the product instead of better. If they remade this without silicone I would 100% repurchase but considering their market is people with natural hair I'm surprised they put silicone in it.
14,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",3.0 out of 5 stars,It smells good but,It smells good but it’s not the product for my girls 3c hair type. It leaves their hair very dry the next day. The conditioner does work well while washing hair but I don’t like how my girls hair looks the next morning I even use their brand leave in conditioner and their hair is very stiff and dry the next day. Because of my experience I would recommend. Disclaimer my daughters use a satin pillow case and hair still hard the next day so it’s def the product
15,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Caucasian curly hair too!,"I felt like all the ads for this product were women of color with curly hair (no complaints, love the diversity) and that made me think that it wouldn’t work for my hair. I took a chance after seeing someone a review from someone who was white with curly hair, and it works great! I feel like my hair is light and bouncy. Big fan!"

The shampoo didn’t get as sudsy as I was expecting but that’s okay for me. If you prefer more suds, I recommend two or three washes. Conditioner gives my hair a TON of slip for detangling and I LOVE that! My hair feels moisturized after rinsing the conditioner out and I just followed up with my regular moisture routine. Definitely sticking with it"
17,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Shampoo is great, Conditioner SUCKS","I received a recommendation for this based on my fine, straight, oily, naturally blonde hair. Everything seems to weigh it down. I will most likely buy the shampoo again, but the one time I used the conditioner my hair looked like a grease pit. I took like ten minutes rinsing it out, but it didn’t matter. I think the glycerin clung to my fine strands. I had to completely rewash my hair, and I was getting ready for work. It still seemed weighed down and greasy after an attempt to wash it out.  The shampoo clarifies my hair and leaves it shiny as long as I use another conditioner."
18,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Shampoo and Conditioner Duo,"Amazon had the set on sale and I liked the idea of water to foam shampoo, plus the scent sounded clean. I have very thick, wavy hair, and found the shampoo to be absolutely delightful to use, the name does it justice! The smell is clean and pleasant, and it really works up a lather. It rinses easily, and then I apply the conditioner, which is also a great product. It's thick but applies easily to my hair, and also rinses out well. My hair is smooth and tangle free after using both products, and the smell lingers even after drying. I will definitely buy again."
19,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Well Pleased,I have low porosity hair and can only use clear non-creamy or non-greasy products so this line works for me. The shampoo is perfect because I can apply it directly to my scalp. The conditioner gives just the right amount of moisture and slip. Both are easily rinsed out without leaving residue. The scent is pleasant and my hair feels very manageable using this product.
20,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,My New Favorite Smell,"The smell is heavenly. I wish I had linen spray for my bed so I could smell it when I go to sleep! It’s so clean a fresh and mild.I also think it’s doing wonders for my hair. My hair was really dry before, so it’s not miraculously perfect, but it’s much softer than it used to be. I think if I keep using it my hair will be the way I want it after a few months."
21,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally found our forever hair wash products,"I love Wash Day Delight, both the shampoo and cream-to-foam conditioner. I've gone through multiple products, trying to find the right one that adds necessary moisture without feeling heavy. Wash Day Delight is it. The aloe scent is fresh and invigorating. The products are light and you don't have to use a lot to get enough lather. They rinse clean, leaving my hair soft and light. I use these products on both my hair and my young daughter's hair. The ingredients are safe and the products are great on a variety of hair textures. My daughter has a lot of tangles and the cream-to-foam conditioner detangles in a breeze. My daughter generally fusses and cries on wash day, but she barely notices when I am working through her tangles with these products."
22,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Try it!,"Love it! Although the shampoo doesn't lather much it is very clarifying. I don't use the little nozzle because the heaviness of the bottle makes me poke myself in the head. The jelly conditioner is that girl. I don't use it as a wash out conditioner, but as a leave in on soaking wet hair. Easy to comb, easy to twist, keeps hair soft and smelling wonderful for a week. Looking forward to trying the floral scent too."
23,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I’ve been looking for!,"This shampoo and conditioner is amazing. I’m 41 years old and have used 100’s of shampoos and conditioners and this by far is my favorite and new “keeper”.My son and I have fine hair but a lot of it and it is porous so it easily tangles. This is the first shampoo and conditioner that has given our hair slip and shine within weighing it down and making it more unmanageable.I highly recommend for fine yet thick and porous hair, you will be delighted by the fragrance and fun of using this product.My scalp feels clean and refreshed and brushing my hair afterwards is a dream!! I look forward to washing my hair using these products. THANK YOU Carol’s Daughter for creating this masterpiece, I will use this wash and rinse again and again!"
24,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,No More Brushing,I saw this on tiktok and had to try it.  I used to have to dry brush my hair before I showered because it was so fine and tangled so easily.  I started using this shampoo and especially conditioner and I haven’t had to brush since. It detangles in seconds and you can finger comb through your hair in the shower. I have turned 5 people on to this product already and will not stop raving.
25,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend! 10/10!,"I can’t thank Carol’s Daughter enough! Ive been struggling with psoriasis on my scalp-particularly my hair line/where my forehead meets my hair-and ever since starting this shampoo and conditioner combo, I’ve noticed less dryness and less sores! It has taken me a minute to adjust to how much is needed to wash and condition but even that is a bonus bc it seems like less is more making them both last longer than your average shampoo and condition! Please give this a try if you suffer from skin conditions! It’s wonderful!!!"
26,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Impressed,"Problem scalp here. I usually have to find something gentle enough to not anger my scalp, but strong enough to do something. I will randomly try different shampoo and conditioner, and will be ok with what they do for me, but this... This one is different! It was just delivered today, so this was my first time using, and I have no flakes coming out of the shower. My hair is soft and easy to comb through, and it feels super clean, but not stripped. I just ordered another duo! You can't beat the value, but I'd probably pay a lot more for this product, after knowing it is awesome! Do yourself a favor and spend the $13!"

I have shoulder length low porosity hair and was hoping this would be moisturizing. It dried my hair out so much! My hair was knotted an brittle. NEVER AGAIN! I'll stick to the Black Vanilla range it's the best.
31,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",4.0 out of 5 stars,Best conditioner ever!,"Let me preface this by saying my hair is 2C/3A color treated. I’ll start with the conditioner. 10/10 would recommend and this will be my new go-to! It made my hair feel so silky and smooth, and very moisturized both under the water and not. The scent wasn’t my favorite at first, but it’s growing on me. The shampoo, unfortunately, ended up making my hair feel really dry. The conditioner made up for it, but next wash day I decided to use my normal shampoo and my hair feels a decent bit better moisturized. Overall I will definitely be buying the conditioner again, but not the shampoo. The search continues!"

This isn’t a shampoo for sure. It’s just plain water it seems. I took a palmful about 5-6 times to see if it still dies what it’s supposed to do, but it failed.

It is but the shampoo was only so-so. I couldn’t get used to how watery it was and it didn’t lather easily. Still it did the job and after the wash my hair felt very clean. The conditioner on the other hand is phenomenal. I loooovvvveeeee it!  My hair was so soft and easy to comb through. This is will now be a permanent part of my wash day!
36,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not For 4c,I fell this shampoo set would be great if you use a lot of product in your hair as it strips your hair to the shaft. No oil left. The conditioner does have slip but no softness or moisture. I have thick 4c hair and this was not the product for me. If I had bought it at Sally's I would have returned it.Sorry Carol.

My daughter has 4a coils, low porosity, and I have been struggling to find a shampoo and conditioner for wash day that didn't leave her hair feeling dry and stripped.

I have always had problems with shampoos building up in my hair after a while and this shampoo has been really helpful. My only complaint is that the shampoo with Aloe is no longer on prime individually and I do not run out of conditioner nearly as fast.

Brushing my curls in the shower and styling it with other products STILL left my hair softer than normal.

145,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The products are excellent, the scent is the most amazing thing in the world","I love the scent of this product so much that I may start using it as body wash.As for my hair; my hair is a mixture of 4B/3C and a patch of 4C. Like the racial admixture of African American people, my hair is literally mixed.I do not regularly wash my hair with shampoo.  Shampoo of all types strip my hair of the oils that are needed, and make it more vulnerable to breakage.  For the people who say that this shampoo makes their hair dry - well duh, yes. It washes away all creams and oils and residue and dirt in your hair because its shampoo.  Shampoos be shampooing.  And that is why I use it sparingly.I co-wash my hair maybe every two weeks, and will only shampoo my hair, i.e. strip my hair of the butters and creams that protect it, maybe once a month or whenever needed.So, the clarifying shampoo only gets used once/twice a month.  The conditioner gel - I use that several times a week as ""hair grease"".  I don't wash it out.  I use it on every inch of my hair to keep it moisturized.  For me, it does not dry to a brittle, ashy mess atop my head, and that is a big plus.  I'm a low-maintenance, seldom-fancy hair woman, but I do care about what it looks like, and I don't want my hair to ever look ""dirty"" because of a gel or conditioner build-up.I also use the conditioner as a setting lotion when I'm doing twists and want spiral curls.In fact, I've never used the conditioner in the shower & washed it out.  I love it as an everyday pomade and curl enhancer.And then...I always smell like the flowers behind the ear of a unicorn dancing in the rain."

I’m Sticking with Shea Moisturizer Shampoo and Conditioner At Least it Detangles me hair and my hair I very Thick… was Hoping that this product would Do what it says.. i Even gave it a second try… Nope that’s what I get for trying New Products 😳😳"

I was struggling with dry scalp recently and I felt intuitively led to try this- on a whim, and I’m so glad I did. I don’t leave reviews, but this stuff is awesome! I will forever use all Carols daughter products from this day forward. I could cry I’m so excited about it. It smells so clean, and the conditioner is the coolest ever! It immediately makes your hair super silky! Blown away at how easy it was to comb through my hair, and I have very long hair and always struggle to blow dry and brush, because it is so tangled after washing, but not anymore. Definitely try this! You’ll be so glad you did"
148,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleansing and non-irritating,"I really like this shampoo, I’m white and Mexican with course wavy to loose-curly hair. I usually only wash my hair every 7-10 days so by that time i have some build up and itchiness going on. This Shampoo has salicylic acid and I think that helps a lot with calming my scalp and getting rid of the itch without being super harsh and drying. I like the thin consistency and the applicator tip, it makes it easy to get down to the scalp. I’m ordering a second bottle of the shampoo and this time I’ll try out the conditioner as well."
149,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Sulfate Free Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner Set with Aloe ($22 Value) - For Curly, Natural Hair, 2 Full Size Products",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really loved this shampoo and conditioner.,"Let me begin by saying that I have 4 daughters who have a ton of hair, plus my own. The idea of cutting down wash time was enough to pique my interest, but after reading the reviews, I had to give Carol’s Daughter one last try. I’d tried a few products in the past, and I wasn’t very impressed. When I got my package today, I was actually excited about washing my 2 yr old’s hair just so I could try them out, and they did not disappoint.  Her hair was so much easier to manage and detangle, I was truly blown away. I let her eat dinner while letting the conditioner sit for about 30 mins, and I could literally see her hair getting softer and shinier the longer she sat.  It was amazing. If you’re on the fence about these products, I would definitely recommend them. I also used these along with the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair. This combo is unmatched and will be my go-tos from now on!"

The downside is the next day I feel that I have to wash my hair again and I know the shampoo n conditioner is causing it even though I rinse thoroughly, I just get that icky feeling on my scalp. So I'll only use this once every other month instead once a week."

   So far i love the amount we are given. I havent tried the products yet but ill update this review later.3b/3c curls:Ive washed once now and im not mad or dissatisfied in any way.  The shampoo did not strip my hair at all. I also didn’t have to use half the bottle like alot of other reviews have said i used like 1/8 of it i have looser curls as well so mabea thats why. Its smells like eucalyptus or tee tree without the mint so very fresh and herby which i like but some will not. It lathers great i applied straight to my scalp. I never really noticed the conditioner gel turn into a cream but it still felt very nice and nourishing to my hair. It wasnt falling off my hair or anything. Id recommend it if your looking for new products to change it up and replenish your routine.  They definitely do what their supposed to and have good size containers."

I don’t have to use leave in conditioner or detangling spray. The scent is amazing. The shampoo is weird and feels like it drys out my hair but when combined with the conditioner, it’s a great duo. The only thing with the conditioner is that it sometimes leaves my hair oily. Not sure if it’s due to not rinsing it out all the way? Overall, though, I love this set. I’ve been buying it for over a year now."

I do enjoy the other products.  Curly chemistry on YouTube recommended and I finally decided to buy and try. It smells delicious and my hair is soft and shiny. I love it. After the first wash you don’t need much. I also bought the mouse and moisturizer. The value is great for what you get also.  Please don’t go up on the price.

That's how much I love this product.I have naturally curly type 2c/3a hair and a preference for longer tresses. I've tried many (many, many) products over the years, this one is my favorite. So glad it's back in stock!The shampoo smells amazing, is light yet suds up beautifully and rinses clean. I love that the bottle allows me to target application at the scalp!The conditioner though is really where the goodness is. It magically untangles the tangles! No more struggling with breakage or annoyingly painful comb outs. With other brand conditioners I had to use a lot of product to coat my hair and get the results I expected - not the case with this product! At most I use a tablespoon of the conditioner on wash day (my hair is long and I have a lot of it!) combing it through while still in the shower. It's the best!"

Although none of them have seen the “clarifying” version I decided to try since I needed a good clarifying shampoo. I mean if everyone says it’s a great brand usually all their products are great, right? Product felt great on my scalp, the applicator made it easy to apply and I could feel the deep penetrating clean but right after that an intense chemical smell that was the level of mustard gas. (I wish I was exaggerating!!!) I was gagging and choking in the shower trying to hurry up and rinse the smell out! Ended up vomiting the recent contents of my stomach in the process. Now I am not normally a scent sensitive person, seriously I love scented stuff (I buy Victoria Secret and Bath and Body Work products) but WOW I swear I was dying! I could taste the freaking smell. And it lingers for days in your hair!!! Even my husband said it smelled like I got a “perm or something”. Hope my hair doesn’t start falling out one wonders with such a smell what is really in that shampoo."

I have thin, 2c/3a, low porosity, brittle hair with extremely hard water.  (I use ion iron-removing shampoo to combat the hardness). However, the slip, scent, and softness of this conditioner are a dream come true! First, I don't rip my hair out when I'm brushing it. Second, it stays moist for days. Third, the scent... omg, the scent.  They should name it GREEN goddess conditioner because it literally smells like you're laying in a fresh meadow. It has a natural, earthy, gender-neutral scent (i.e. you can smell the castor oil if you know what that smells like). There are absolutely ZERO eye-watering, obnoxious perfume scents, so if that's what you like, keep looking. Otherwise, give this a try.  I was pleasantly surprised."

That being said, the product is phenomenal . I have 2 B curls and have been experimenting with a LOT of conditioners (dove, herbal essence, etc) to my detriment. After literally one wash my curls are shiny and bouncy and held their shape even after and awkward nap. Finally something that works for everyday and doesn’t require me to put on styling products just to see my curls."

The strong perfume smell did take me by surprise, and I admit I didn’t look at the ingredients list until my first use and realizing the perfume-y scent from this was so strong (I work in health care, and don’t wear perfume-y stuff because of my patients). Also, I have a lot of long, thick hair, but it is very prone to breakage. Buuuut, upon applying this conditioner, it was so thick and luxurious, and I was able to comb through my wet hair in the shower incredibly easy with little product, I honestly could not believe it. I have never used a product that could detangle my hair with such ease unless I globbed it on.MY HAIR ACTS YOUNG AGAIN, if that makes any sense. It has the body and bounce it had when I was in my early 20s. I’m in my mid 30s now and have been disappointed in the change in my hair over time. This product literally changed my hair back to its golden days in one use!Yes, I’m giving it 4 stars, but this is because the perfume smell is so strong and unnecessary, and yes, it’s one of the first ingredients, which I really feel takes away from the quality of this product. Nothing but actual perfume needs to smell this strong, so I hope the makers of this product consider at least toning it down. But also I want to tell the makers THANK YOU for making this stuff! I could cry having my old hair back, I’m so grateful!"

Ever since my brother died I've had horrible hair loss I'm 27 he died when I was 25, and that mirabella plum stuff stopped my hair loss. I wish I would have bought 50 bottles while they still had it on beauty outlet sites. This stuff is OK, it's doing just an OK job with the hair loss, it's very oily and has a really strong fragrance compared to mirabella plum. For hair breakage it's the best thing carols daughter has right now."

This conditioner not only provides ample moisture, but it also has such a wonderful, aromatic scent that stays on the hair post-rinse. I would definitely recommend this conditioner for those with dry, damaged, over-processed hair."

I have tried so many products and had pretty much given up. I have always had shiny straight hair but it became very dry and frizzy with menopause in addition to a Sjogrens diagnosis. After one use, my hair is SO much softer and less frizzy and dry. I don’t even know if I would still call it frizzy, it is very mild.

   I love this shampoo an conditioner, first time I bought it at a store but I wanted to save a little by buying on amazon. The conditioner was spilled everywhere. The only reason I won’t return is because it was cheap and I didn’t lose that much. The shampoo was intact. Next time I’ll buy them at Walmart, a little pricier than here but I won’t have spill problems."

I had my mom use it one day and she fell in.love too her hair soaked up the moisture and looked Soo healthy and shiny after only 1 use. I would love to buy this over and over again. I want to try using the shampoo as well. I only wish I would have bought them out when they were on clearance even tho the higher price is well worth it. Some say it smells.of.perfume but it is.all natural and it smells amazing because of the ingredients it has in it. I have been growing my hair out for about 4 years now wish I would have discovered this product in the beginning of my hair growth journey it really works.

66,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It Will Make A Difference,"I’ve only used it once so far and ordinarily I wouldn’t think that’s enough time to make a good review. This case however, is an exception. It’s the first time I have ever used a conditioner that actually made a difference. I have very fine, damaged, light colored hair that breaks very easily. I had extensions eight months ago and when I took them out three months ago I had a lot of breakage and damage. Usually after I wash my hair and dry it, there is broken, damaged, flyaway hair on the back of my head that will never settle down, no matter what I do. I used this conditioner one time, and my hair already feels smoother and stronger already. I have tried so many different products trying to get the same results, over time, that I got with the first time use of this product. I don’t know how it will react on other types of hair. But I can tell you, if you have damaged, broken, flyaway, baby hair like mine, it will make a huge difference for the better. It doesn’t feel greasy, it feels smooth and silky going through your hair, rinses easily and has a very pleasant aroma. Carol has a great daughter."
67,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the way this leaves my hair, with body and without frizz. I don't know about the reparative part, can't tell.The scent starts off strong and bright, mellows to a persistent whisper (to mix my metaphors). To me it's sweet berry with a little spice, including ginger.The scent may be designed to cover the seed oils, which by themselves don't smell good to some people, though they're fairly far down in the list of ingredients here. (The ingredients are listed in order by weight on the Amazon main product page under Important Information.)Came taped to avoid leakage. There was a film of conditioner on the tube, but it was slight enough that I couldn't feel it until it got wet. I don't think it leaked, I think it was from the manufacturing process."
68,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"I am using this fortifying conditioner as a weekly deep conditioning treatment because the delicate and somewhat curly texture of my hair causes products like this to weigh it down, so daily use is too intense. Always a difficult balance because curly hair with a thin texture breaks and tangles easily so it needs a conditioner but the solution for my hair is weekly rather than daily and this product works well used that way.The scent is an interesting blend that is difficult to describe but it is more perfume than herbal. The concentration is quite strong so if avoiding fragrances in personal care products this may be an issue, otherwise liking or disliking the scent is subjective.The conditioner is thick and rich and the 11 ounce flip-top tube is large so it is a generous supply. No artificial dyes, parabens, petrolatum, mineral oil or animal derived ingredients are used and internet research confirms that this brand’s products are cruelty-free although not noted on the tube."

71,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked wonders on my fine hair after first use,"I bought this at Walgreen's on a fluke. I have very fine, straight hair with a slight wave of air dried that is very oily at the roots but dry and brittle at the ends.  My hair has been getting more and more fizzy as well.  Because of the pandemic, I’ve grown my hair out quite a bit (down to the bra strap line), but because my hair is so fine, it’s hard to do without my ends thinning out and breaking a lot.  I bought this even though it’s supposed to be for curly hair because it touted the strengthening qualities, which is what I need. I’ve also read about how castor oil is great for hair.On the day I first used it, my husband commented on how long my hair was getting while I was brushing before bed.  When I threw it back and turned around so he could see it on my back, he exclaimed, “wow! It looks so thick!”  Again, I have very fine hair that gets scraggly and straw-like very easily if I don’t brush it (which is hard because I can’t brush too much since it’s dry at the ends and therefore breaks easily).  I thought it was a fluke because I had just trimmed about half an inch off my hair.  But I’ve used it a couple times since I bought it and I’m just so thrilled with this conditioner! It certainly FEELS like my hair is stronger and it definitely looks thicker.  I can’t stop running my hands through it!I was worried about what it would do because of how oily my hair gets (I’ve been trying to train it for over a year by only washing a two to three times a week, but I’m just now barely getting to the point where day two isn’t a full on oil slick on my head), but I haven’t experienced any oiliness that I would attribute to ths conditioner.  It’s really hard for me to find a conditioner that will actually condition and moisturize without making my hair greasy by the afternoon.  So far, this conditioner simply leaves my hair soft all day.I wasn't thrilled with the smell, but it’s NOTHING like what some of the reviews here say.  I’m wondering if they got some sort of bad or spoiled batch. It doesn’t have an overpowering smell at all.  In fact, I can’t strand strong perfume smells because I have a sensitive sense of smell.  The smell is earthy with a hint of vanilla.  It’s not like most hair products so it threw me off, but its actually very pleasant once you get used to it. I think many of us are just used to that pretty flowery or fruity smell almost all other hair products have.  But the reviews saying it’s horrendous and overpowering to the point of giving headaches is very surprising to me.  I was using a conditioner before his that I could smell even just sitting around, but this one I have to put my hair right up to my nose to smell it. I was worried I wouldn't like it because it didn’t smell enough or as well as other conditioners, but it’s just right and definitely has grown on me. It’s a very natural smell that reminds me of being in nature—that’s the best way I can put it."
72,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have been using this conditioner all week on my blonde, heavily highlighted hair since I do experience breakage after salon visits and thought this might help. And it does, to some extent, my hair feels soft and has more body and volume than usual which I really like but as for the breakage, I don't see a ton of improvement. It is however easy to use, it squeezes out easily so you have to be careful not to use too much since a little goes a long way and it is easy to distribute thru my hair and rinses great. The scent, well, it's not too strong which is good because I only marginally like it but it's only there while using it in the shower and does not linger.  Comb out isn't bad but not as effortless as some conditioners I have used. I did not see much difference in shine and actually get more shine from other conditioners like Seven and Purology. But it did leave my hair feeling pretty silky and thick."
73,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"First of all, each of the ingredients are known to strengthen and grow hair, so combined together without any harsh chemicals, this conditioner soaks in and does exactly what it claims to as far as my hair is concerned. My hair is silky soft, less frizzy, and non-greasy with each use. But let’s talk about the smell…it’s a spicy, warm scent, almost masculine to me, but my husband loves the fragrance and thinks it smells fresh and neutral. He literally buried his nose in my hair to take it in the first time I conditioned with this product. The scent lingers as this conditioner really does drench the hair follicle doing wondrous repairs all the while. I’m used to conditioners that smell fruity or floral, so this is a departure for me, but my husband’s opinion of it is enough for me to not dock any stars over it. The conditioner works well, really well, so it’s a win for my hair."
74,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 50 REVIEWER,"This conditioner is very thick and creamy. It leaves hair feeling soft and hydrated. The castor oil and black seed oil make your scalp tingle a little in a good way if you use it with heat. I haven't used it long enough to say it strengthened my hair, but it definitely feels improved after only one use. I highly recommend this entire line.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
75,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm already a huge fan of the Carol's Daughter brand because I have been using the spray on almond milk leave in conditioner for a couple of years. I was hesitant to try their shampoos and conditioners because I assumed with all of the  oils it wouldn't work well for my thin, flat hair. I am so in love with the conditioner. It is thick and rich. I only need about a nickle to quarter sized amount for my hair that is a few inches past my shoulders. The scent it interesting and kind of fancy. The ginger and black cumin come though a lot but it smells like a perfume scent...not a food scent. I have the type of hair that gets tangled 5 minutes after I brush it and I have to brush it ALL the time. Whenever I use this conditioner my hair stays relatively tangle free and so soft and easy to deal with. It doesn't weigh my hair down at all even with daily use."
76,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the invigorating scent of this product.  The ginger makes it a bit peppery (like celery is peppery, not like black pepper), and it helps to wake me up when I use it.  I've noticed that my fine hair has developed fewer split ends and those that do appear, appear at a much slower rate than before I used this product.  I only apply this conditioner once or twice a week as it tends to weigh down fine hair if used on a daily basis.  I store the tube with the lid up so that it doesn't leak.  I would recommend this product for men or women as it smells wonderful.I received this product for free in exchange for this review."

It left my hair feeling stronger but silky smooth at the same time.  I think the smell is a preference thing - I really liked the way it made my hair smell.The only thing that was a negative for me was that the bottle felt as if some of the product leaked out during shipping.  It seemed sealed, but the container felt slick to the touch.  They should make sure the shipping packaging is protecting it from leakage.  Otherwise, great product."
78,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Paraben Free Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, For Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 11 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I generally like this company's products. My daughter has super tight curly hair that I would call 3B and a minimum. It is very frizzy and hard to manage so I'm always looking for that miracle that will help keep things under control. While this works, I can deal with the super strong smell. This isn't even on my head but I can't take it when my daughter walks by and she doesn't seem to care for it either. If you don't mind that sent then this is a good product but for me, it's overwhelming."

So even with frequent trims, it needs extra help. So I thought I would give a very intense conditioner a try.This conditioner did a good job repairing my hair. Actually, a little too good, as my hair is now very soft and I needed to add styling products to manage it. This is a conditioner that I would only need to use once or twice a month for it to be effective on my type of hair."

I've used their products before and there is a common running theme among them - a little goes a long way.Little conditioner is needed for my shoulder-length, very thick and heavy hair. Hair comes out really soft. Many of the ingredients are natural, and that can be felt when applying it to your hair. The smell is a bit on the stronger side but I do not mind it."

I am really impressed with this one.  First the scent was a little weird, but it's not too bad.  Everything else is great.  I left it on for a few minutes while I washed up and my hair was noticeably  less frizzy and soft.  I will definitely be keeping this in my regular arsenal of hair care."

Easy to use in the shower since the product is meant to be stored with the cap down. A little on the expensive side, but a small amount is all you need for daily use."

It adds more ""body"" to my thin hair. The scent is new to me but is pleasant. My wife has thicker hair but she likes it too. It comes in a 11 fl oz tube, which is a good amount. I would prefer it come in a pump bottle though."

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"

It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"

6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."

If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."

It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."

BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."

Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."

Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."

15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."

I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"

I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.
22,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best find for my kinky curls, after 40 years of searching!","I had stopped buying products since nothing seemed to work for my kinky, white-girl curls. I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"
23,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only Carol's Daughter Product I use,"I've purchased Carol's Daughter products in the past and many of them were average, for me.  Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."

I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."

I apply this to my hair every time I wash it, which is usually 2-3 times a week. I leave it on for at least 5 minutes to really moisturize my hair. I love the smell and it makes my hair soft, silky and shiny."

29,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."
30,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like old spice, but my hair feels great!","I’ve used the original hair milk in the past and really liked it, so I decided to try the coco creme hair mask.This does not smell like coco or cream or any combination of the two. The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."

This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

Super dry hair problem solved in first use.,"Since my hair started going gray it has become unmanageable and I’ve been struggling to figure out how to care for it. It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

This was the only product I used and there's absolutely no frizz! Very thick butter so a little goes a long way. I pat my finger tips onto the butter and rub into my fingers, and then through my hair. I am a fan!"

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or this is just a bad batch but it’s horrible."

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips. Then I did the same thing at my roots surrounding my face. But the greatest thing was that I didn't habe ti do or add anything else to get defined curls and waves. This is my new go-to.

I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming. The intensity of the chemical smell plus coconut  did reduced overnight but not enough. To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

I do enjoy the scent. BUTTTT it is a little sticky. I'm normally heavy-handed with the product but this one even with a little can leave a weird film if too much is used so be careful. Otherwise great & smells great. 7/10 overall.

Yikes!,"I'm sure the conditioner is awesome, but I didn't get a chance to use it. After lifting up the seal I noticed something black in the conditioner. I put my finger in to pull it out, and it was a a clump of hair. Almost like somebody had been using it and the hair on their hand went into the container as they double dipped. Disgusted...."

If that’s what your hair needs, this foots the bill, but after a month and a half of use I saw no improvement in curl structure either, so I’m going to try a different brand."
119,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Strong smell,Horrific sent... The worse. The moisturizer part is pretty good but I literally could not get pass the smell. It smelled like very cheap perfume but it was so strong i could smell it all day.

Not hair out styles.  I have a tight curl, very dry hair and tried to use with hair out didn’t work.  Gonna double twist and see how it goes. But, it’s def not moisturizing. At least I had no flakes.

620,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."
625,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Causes extreme hair loss! Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."
627,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,"This conditioner is supposed to be helpful for ""extremely dry hair,"" which is not the case for me--mine tends toward oily.  But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."
628,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thick, coarse, dry, wavy/curly, highlighted hair.  I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."
629,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this curl gel! I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It kept them defined and smelling good all day. Haven’t noticed any flaking. However, if you use a lot in one section, the curls have like a firm-crisp feeling, but not crunchy, just firm. It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

This one is heavenly!  When you have curls, you don't want heavy products.  This mist smells amazing.  I love how lightweight it is.  I sprayed this on my clean hair, once while damp and again while dry.  My curls were not sticky or stiff, but shiny and smooth.  While I do not have very dry hair, I felt that this mist added a nice amount of hydration to my hair.  I will definitely use this as a refresher for my curls on days that I do not wash my hair.

645,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

The scent of the product is amazing it smells really good. The gel is light weight and does not weigh down hair. The gel cream is a little tacky or sticky when applying but that feeling goes away.

While I still have frizz, I feel like I'm able to have more days where my hair is down versus it being up in a bun or in a ponytail. I love the smell of the spray and I also like how much product is in the bottle. I'm able to use this to refresh my hair throughout the week or for what I need additional moisture added to my hair. I would definitely get this again because of how much I've been enjoying my curls. I also like how long the mist is when dispensing the product into my hair; one spritz goes a long way."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more.

651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while.

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."
658,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deeply hydrating,"The summer humidity had left my curls feeling dry and frizzy, and my normal cowash routine seemed to get longer everyday as my regular conditioner no longer had the same slip so I was more than excited to try this conditioner. First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

But I love the product so much that I can put up with the smell. I put a good amount of gel on my wet hair as it is long and curly. It sure is gel...slimy and all. But it works. I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

Was hoping this would be perfect for my hair, but when it arrived I realized how strong it smelled....If you read the ingredients list, ""Parfum (Fragrance)"" is surprisingly high up on the list (appears before the stabilizers and all the good fruit extracts), and you can really tell. This stuff has a very strong, sharp artificial scent that, for me, is a total turn off. I'm sensitive to strong fragrances and won't be able to use this at all. So bummed!"

I have super dry, thick, frizzy hair and it works great. I was so glad to finally try their sulfate-free shampoo too. I have been using Deva-Curl NoPoo Shampoo and it works great, but I like to change up my shampoo and not use the same one all the time. This Coco Creme Shampoo feels like it cleans my hair, but doesn’t dry it out at all. I only wash my hair about twice a week, so this bottle lasts a long time for me. You only really need one squirt for medium length hair. Smells great too! Love it!"

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

Even after just one use you can see and feel the results. My hair looks so healthy and has a shine that it didn’t before. This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

My hair is so naturally dry I don't even rinse the conditioner out; I just gently work the conditioner down to my ends and squeeze out the conditioner with the excess water. This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo. The pump is handy. I prefer for my conditioner to have a pump so I can measure each time I use it (3 pumps). I don't know who Carol is or her daughter, but they make some pretty good hair products for curly hair."

The smell of this mask is amazing.  It has a sweet, coconut fragrance that lingers long after rinsing the product out of your hair.  The mask itself is very thick and silky feeling and absorbs quickly into the hair.  Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.  Every time I have used this mask, it has left my hair feeling nourished and smooth.  It also brings a bit of shine back to my hair.  Great product that is made in the USA."

Rhassoul Clay

   shampoo and conditioner for months now, and I really like those.  This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent.

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly. Carol’s Daughter has become by far my favorite line of shampoos and conditioners."

It is probably one of the only hair products I’ve used that has resulted in a visible improvement in my hair. I have long highlighted hair which has never been the healthiest from years of color.

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours. So the idea of a moisturize and conditioner in one was enticing. But the problem with this product is that it contains alcohol, and that, as most people know, dries your hair. So it is counter intuitive... the benefits of the coconut oil get erased by the drying factor of the alcohol. Oh well."

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.) My thick, curly hair absorbed it well enough, though the product is a bit thin. My hair, once dry, looks nice, but I have difficulty with the wet comb-through.  With a conditioner that works well, I can comb my wet hair easily.  So this product is a bit of a disappointment."

Some, like this conditioner, I like less than others.My hope was for a light cocoa butter-ish smell and that it would work for my daughter's leaning-toward-oily hair. Sadly, the scent is very strong and sickeningly sweet (I do have sensitive sinuses) while it enhances the oiliness of her hair. She only used it a few times before we had to stop. I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

It does contain coconut oil, milk, murumuru and mango butters, which hydrate and nourish the hair. It has a light and refreshing coconut scent. In addition, this wonderful shampoo comes in any easy-to-use pump bottle for your convenience. It is fairly priced for an excellent, concentrated shampoo.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."

I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls.

I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil, Paraben Free Hair Conditioner for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

No more frizz,"I’ve always dealt with frizz my whole life. This conditioner is amazing in that it makes my frizz go away and defines the wave in my hair.I use old spice shampoo and then this. Hoping to find a Carol’s Daughter Shampoo that doesn’t weigh down my hair. The conditioner is amazing though.So many white people shampoo strips the moisture from your hair and it doesn’t nourish it like it needs to be. Even the standard white people conditioner doesn’t do much when applied at the end.I did try the shampoo that goes along with this but it weighted down my hair too much. My hair and scalp did really love the moisture though. I didn’t know my scalp needed moisturizing too.Maybe something else in Carol Daughter’s line up will work for me better. My hair is wavy, maybe even more curly than I know? I’ve had frizz issues my whole life and have never really seen my defined curls.This conditioner, though, does the trick. If I don’t use it, my hair sticks up all over.Highly recommend to buy."

It has good slip, nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. My hair did feel moisturized and my curls were a little more defined after washing it out. I didn't expect the scent to be so heavy though. It's just straight rose, like a rose bomb hit your nostrils. Some may like it, I don't care for how fragrant it is.But other than the strong scent, it's a serviceable conditioner. I also like how much product you get for the price."

Her scalp has never produced oil. Her hair has always been dry and it tangles easily. If I go more than 6 hours without brushing her hair it does start to get matted. I tried all the usual white people conditioners, oils, deep conditioning treatments. I've tried a few products for African hair or mixed hair as well. This is the first thing that I've found that helps keeps her hair tangle free. It's so much softer and shinier. Which makes both of us happy because combing her hair used to be a battle."

It neither moisturizes nor detangles (zero slip). I'm using it up, but honestly, this does nothing and I need to use products to supplement what this is supposed to do.

We have tried all kinds of remedies to calm her curls but nothing seemed to work until we tried Carol's Daughter Detangling Jelly-to-Cream.

101,"Carol's Daughter Detangling Jelly-to-Cream Conditioner With Glycerin and Rose Water, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair Paraben Free for Moisture, Hydration, and Shine, Curl Conditioner 20 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"These are some key points in my experience with this product, but first I will describe my hair type..My length is right above my butt so almost 2ft of hair, my hair is previously colored but I have not colored it in over a year, its naturally curly, and is usually frizzy and dry.Now for the conditioner:- smells great: if you love rose water, you will love this conditioner! (Scent is a little strong though, if you are sensitive to scented things)- a little goes a LONG way! I have a ton of hair and used a very small amount compared to other conditioners- leaves hair soft and shiny (i didn't even need to put leave in treatment in after shower like I normally do)- jell turns into a creamy texture and has detangeling effect on hair- with most hair products i cant tell much of a difference in my hair after using, but this one worked great for me and my hair type and I'm going to keep buying it."

What I can say is that I've used better conditioners to detangle that my hair that don't necessarily cater to kinky hair types and had better results. When I first received this and opened the jar, the smell was overwhelmingly delicious and super yummy so I just knew it was going to be a great product. The smell alone sold me and I know that Carol's Daughter has a great line of products (some of which are not as beneficial for my hair as I would have hoped). I will say that it does turn from a thick jelly consistency to a cream that's still pretty thick as well. I could feel some slip when I first rubbed it in my hands so I can tell that there is some slip and some cones in the mix. However, when applying it to my hair, I did not feel an immediate release of tangles or softening of the tangles or texture. It was at that point that I knew it wasn't going to do what I needed it to do. I should have just followed up with my normal Avlon 5 in 1. While the product was in my hair, I could not finger detangle anything and that as highly upsetting. After rinsing, I could definitely feel the cones and moisture in my strands but the tangles were there to stay and I just wasn't thrilled. It made a mess for me to detangle when rinsing out and I think I should have just stuck with what I know. I cannot say that this will work for all hair types as it felt dry just putting it in my hair. I haven't used it on anyone else to see what a difference it would have made but I'm afraid to. I may just hand this off to a family member who wants something to smell good when applying to their extensions or something. As a stylus, this could not be in my arsenal or backbar. Sorry."
103,"Carol's Daughter Detangling Jelly-to-Cream Conditioner With Glycerin and Rose Water, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair Paraben Free for Moisture, Hydration, and Shine, Curl Conditioner 20 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Instant softness,"I have been growing my hair out and the longer it gets the more I am realizing that it is not completely zero upkeep to grow your hair out. My wife suggested that I begin using conditioner to soften my hair and to help with avoiding tangles. At first I bought the cheapest conditioner I could find to get the job done. I quickly realized that more than likely I would need to try some different products. I was not overly impressed with the cheap conditioners I tried.  They weren’t softening my hair at all.This conditioner is in a huge tub. I like that it’s easy to scoop out and apply as much as needed. The conditioner has a jelly sort of look and feel. It’s almost clear with a little bit of cloudiness. The fragrance is fairly strong. The rose is definitely noticeable. I did go with some thing that was fragrant because I figured if I didn’t like it then my wife could use it. The fragrance also lasts after I have conditioned my hair and it is dry. It’s nowhere near as intense of a smell as right out of the tub. Although it’s strong it’s a pleasant fragrance. It’s an old fashioned rose scent, very floral and clean.As for the effectiveness of the conditioner, it immediately adds moisture. When I add it to my hair, it is immediately softer. I have found that leaving it in for a few minutes also gives me a richer moisture experience."
104,"Carol's Daughter Detangling Jelly-to-Cream Conditioner With Glycerin and Rose Water, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair Paraben Free for Moisture, Hydration, and Shine, Curl Conditioner 20 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I've been using Viori bar shampoo and conditioner and really liking it.  I saw this detangling conditioner on Amazon and decided to compare.  This is more like mainstream conditioner, thick, creamy, very luxurious feeling.  I have very thick hair that is over processed, growing out the gray and lots of curls underneath that like to tangle.  For years I used the heaviest conditioner products I could get.  Then I started using lighter products and realized I don't have to apply tons of heavy product for the same effect.  The things I like about this product....I like the fact in comes in a big tub.  Much easier to grab as much or as little as you want/need.  You really don't need much so it should last a long time.  My hair is below my shoulders and thick.  It feels nice and rinses cleanly.  I was able to brush my hair as easily as with the Viori Rice Conditioner bar.  Both seemed the same.  Perhaps the Carol's was a bit easier.  I was worried the Carol's product would weigh my already heavy hair down, but I just blow-dried it and it is nice and light and clean feeling.  The only thing I didn't love was the scent.  It smells strongly of rose (no surprise since it is a rose-water product) but it reminded me of the ""old"" days when my Mom and Grandma bought a lot of AVON products that smelled like this.  I'm kind of sensitive to scents so I generally go with no scent or very light cents.  I like the VIORI product because it is very, very, very light on scent.  It also rinsed a bit quicker but that is because it is a much lighter product.  I would definitely recommend this product if you like or don't mind the rose scent.  If you have youngsters with long hair that tends to tangle this would be great.  Don't use more than necessary though."
105,"Carol's Daughter Detangling Jelly-to-Cream Conditioner With Glycerin and Rose Water, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair Paraben Free for Moisture, Hydration, and Shine, Curl Conditioner 20 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,love it,"i have straight hair but it’s always dry and sometimes it’ll get frizzy and i hate it. this helps more than regular conditioner and allows me to save some money because i end up using hair masks as conditioners sometimes and that’s costly! you get a lot so i like that but i’m not a fan of the packaging. i might move the product into a bottle that i can squeeze so i don’t get water inside the container when i need some. other than that the thicker texture makes it easier to get it all in your hair and not have to worry about it inconveniently sliding off and wasting product. i’ll be getting more for sure, it’s going to help me out a lot during the colder months."

Because this conditioner has a strong silicone (dimethecone) in its ingredients I decided to use it to pre detangle my hair before washing instead of using it as a conditioner as directed.I wet my hair down in the sink, grab a piece of paper towel for the shed hair and begin finger detangling in sections. My hair is detangled in 15-20 minutes or less with very minimal shedding. It was unbelievable!  I then go to wash it out with the matching sulfate free Wash day Delight Shampoo and Pantene naturals conditioner.An honest god send will not use anything else to detangle this is now a staple product and I keep 2 jars on hand at all times. Excessive wear and tear shedding, breakage are a things of the past. retaining more length and fullness as a result and have only been using it for a month. Very happy with this product."

I prepoo with an oil mask, shampoo and then use conditioner or a mask and leave it on overnight, rinse in the morning. This conditioner works really well for my hair, it took a little tweaking though for me to get it right. The first time I used this I put it all over my head, and proceeded like normal. When my hair dried from my roots to an inch out my hair felt TERRIBLE, like it was coated in some fake silicone crap. I put more conditioner on my dry hair and shampooed my roots again and that worked much better, I just need to remember to keep this off my scalp. It smells amazing, very strongly of rose, but a good rose. It says its a gel to cream, but I didn't see the cream stage of it and the consistency was like vaseline, but don't worry, it rinses easily."

This product, Carol's Daughter detangling jelly-to-cream conditioner with glycerin and rose water, was less than so-so for me.  You need a lot of product for it to be effective, and I found that it did not condition my hair, nor did it help with detangling (quite the opposite).  It has glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and a lot of other ingredients, most of which aren't that slippery or hydrating.  I also don't like having to dip my fingers into the container.  The rose scent was okay, and not overpowering.  I can't recommend this product."

I like it but it may be overwhelming for some - and for us the reason we noticed this first is because it was simply popped in a bubble envelope for shipping and the top worked itself loose so we got half a tub as the rest was all over the envelopeIt is very rich and a little goes a long way! But it does a great job of conditioning and nourishes the hair without weighing it down ! Make sure to rinse well after use to remove all residue .Good conditioning , strong scent!"

I have a hard time using this product due to the pungent odor of the conditioner. I actually enjoy natural and artificial rose scents- that is actually one of the reasons I chose this product. But this is something else. I can't knock the product though, it IS good, and scent is subjective, so just heed my warning, this has a very fragrant rose scent."

The issue is sticking your fingers in the jar is while washing hair puts too much water in the product as while as shredded hair.  The shelf life is shortened for that reason. Other than that the product is good. I recommend a pump to get the product out jar.

It left a sticky greasy residue in my hair after using it. It didn't seem to wash out from the roots and I had to get back in the shower to shampoo it out. It made my hair feel awful afterward. It also made my hair tangle up.  I would not recommend.

It does wear off so that helps. I DO wish theyd make an unscented one that would GREAT as I see tht many ppl have mentioned the same thing. I have very long hair  that has a bit of curl and  wave in it so it gets frickn tangled..EASY!! The glycerin  in this really helps  the comb glide thru,to help this mess."

0,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy from here,"I think this is a fake. I bought hoping to avoid a trip to the store. My hair seems more dry and tangled than usual. I’ve been using this brand of conditioner for 3 years now and never had a problem with it until I bought from this seller. I usually buy from Target. Now that I’m comparing and taking a closer look, I noticed the labels are different."
1,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware! All products not authentic,"Okay, so I was skeptical ordering this product from Amazon because (as mentioned by others in other posts), you don’t know if you’re getting an authentic product from a legitimate seller. So, I ordered once. I was happy with the product (conditioner) and decided to reorder, during the quarantine. Well, that was a huge mistake. I don’t know what has been done to this product, but upon application- my skin began burning almost immediately! I could hardly rinse it out before my ears, parts of my scalp and hands started to swell. By the time I removed most of the product from my skin, my hands had already blistered. Twenty four hours later and they are completely infected. I don’t know what this product is, but it is not the same that ordered previously. The reason I was so satisfied with the first conditioner I bought (via Amazon) was because it was gentle, not harsh. Second time around, not the same! I’m sitting right now trying to decide if I will need oral antibiotics from my doctor. Buyers, beware."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my hair :(,The only reason I'm giving low starts is because this product didn't work for MY hair. Smelled like heaven and I desperately wanted to use the product. I have baby fine hair but even with the combined leave-in conditioner it was a nightmare to brush out. I had to use my usual leave-in product to try and fix the rat nest my hair turned into. I was really bummed because I wanted to like this product since I heard such wonderful things. I'm giving a 2 instead of 1 only because the scent was so lovely.
3,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful,"The name of this product is perfect if it's taken literally, viz. if you want dry dull hair... this is the perfect product for you. If you want healthy soft glowing hair, stay far far away.I get so frustrated with bad hair products that do more damage to your hair than the original state. This is one of those products, and since this is the only product I've tried--I will be avoiding this brand entirely.Dryness and increased breakage were noticeable after first couple uses. Finally threw the rest of the product out."
4,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthiest Hair I've had in 20 years!,"All I can say about this conditioner is WOW!  I have very coarse, dry and wavy/curly hair. I have tried every product imaginable within my limited budget and nothing has ever worked. I started using the Black Vanilla Shampoo several weeks ago but was unable to find the conditioner in a store near me. After falling in love with the shampoo I was on a mission to find the conditioner. I washed my hair tonight using both the Black Vanilla Shampoo and Conditioner and just let my hair air dry. My hair has never been this soft/shiny/healthy looking since I was young. I will be ordering another bottle of both next week so I don't run out. If you have thick, coarse, frizzy, curly hair give this a try. The scent is so beautiful yet not overpoverpowering and the quality is amazing. I am so excited to finally find something that actually works on my hair and the price is unbelievable. I hope they never stop making this product line."

6,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best 5min conditioners I've used. Highly recommend!,"One of the best 5 min conditioners I've used. I previously used a DE conditioner (not the reconstructor one) that was sold in that 32oz jug. Since I ran out of that conditoner, I had to find something else. On a side note, the DE conditioner did absolutely nothing for my hair. I simply thought quick conditioners did nothing for my hair. After I ran out of the DE conditioner, I would just skip this step and move straight to the deep conditioner. It didn't feel softer nor was it easy to remove the tangles in my hair. It may as well have made my hair more matted and tangled. I have ~4b hair but it is on the fine side in terms of how thick the strands are, and my hair is about mid bra strap length. Softness and tangles are the key issues I need my conditioner to fix.Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Conditioner has a fabulous smell and made my hair feel so soft after rinsing out. I hope this comes in a bigger bottle. Used about half the bottle in one wash day. Highly recommend.As for the packaging, it was good. The pump was off when it came out the box but when using it I was able to snap it back into place. Otherwise no mess in the box."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great scent-ok moisturizing.,"I tend to have very dry ends, and through some quick online research this product was recommended to me.  It smells amazing, but could stand to be a little more moisturizing.  I only shampoo my roots and only condition my ends, to avoid dry ends/oily scalp as much as possible, but after using this product my hair feels base level moisturized instead of nicely conditioned.  That said I do have a subscription to this product, but if you're looking for an intense, moisture rich product, look elsewhere."

9,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed,"I wanted this to be awesome but it was NOT. Smells amazing, but instantly makes my hair feel like straw in the shower. And it isn’t any better once rinsed or combed or dried. Makes my hair feel awful. It just didn’t moisturize enough for me. Left my curls stringy."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too thick for my hair,"I bought the product because I love vanilla and in that regard, it did not disappoint. It smells great and the scent lingers. The conditioner feels soft and creamy. It worked great the first couple of times I used it. But it does not detangle my hair easily unless I use quite a bit of it, which wears my hair down. And it does not much for my frizz. I'll work through the bottle but I don't think I'll be buying it again. This is not a good fit for my curly/wavy thick hair."

It has a nice vanilla scent that’s not too overwhelming and leaves my curly hair feeling soft and smelling nice. Though it was a good price and I like it, I will likely not be purchasing it again because it did not sufficiently hydrate my hair and left it still feeling dry"

It's lightweight, detangles better than anything else I've tried in my life and is an excellent moisturizer. You'll probably need another conditioner or other product for protein, but for everything else...This is excellent."

68,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Hair Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Biotin and Vitamin B5, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can make the dullest, over processed hair soft and shine!","Fantastic conditioner for dry, color processed hair. I have longer curly hair that is very dry. I have color treated my hair for 20 yrs (highlighting since I was a teen) and it has taken it's toll. My hair is course and lacks that luster/shine we all seek. After years of trying traditional conditioners (it seems every product has a line) with little satisfaction, I thought outside the box. I went to my local Target, went for the small and often neglected multicultural section of beauty products and bought several different brands. I am embarrassed to say, that it never dawned on me prior to that. I purchased leave in conditioners, hair masks, creams, sprays and good old conditioner.Methodically I tried each product in hopes of a soft, bouncy, hydrated curls. Carols Daughter Vanilla conditioner nailed it. My hair is silk soft and manageable with this product. I only need a dab the size of a quarter to half dollar and let it soak in while I shave  or loofa. Just a minute or two and rinse. My hair is easy to comb through, smells outstanding and shines! Yes, the dull, course over processed hair shines. This stuff is impressive and worth every penny.On a side note, although I love this conditioner, I am not a huge fan of the shampoo in this line or spray leave in conditioner. The shampoo feels thick and my hair doesn't feel clean. The consistency, while probably good for my hair feels oily and it is as if I can't wash it out? The leave in conditioner smells amazing, but I don't really see or feel a difference in my hair when I use it.As for where to purchase, Walmart and Amazon seem to be neck an neck on price. It varies by a few pennies depending on when it's purchased. Target is always $1 to $2 more per bottle."

I used it about every other day and I think that is too often to use this product. Would be better for someone whose hair is in a protective style, in my opinion.

It's doing a good job of keeping my hair moist, and isn't too hard to lather like some natural products. It works better than a lot of natural conditioners I've tried. I also enjoy the scent, very strong vanilla! I gave it 4 stars because my hair is still pretty dull looking. It's definitely doing a lot of work (my hair is pretty soft using it, when without conditioner, it's like steel wool), but it could be doing more. The hunt for the perfect conditioner continues!"

It's got a lovely, sweet fragrance but it seemed like once I rinsed my hair, the fragrance was gone.  It made my hair soft but I didn't notice any difference in the rate of split ends - - which is important to me as I have very dry hair/scalp.  Maybe if the user has more oily/less dry hair, they'd have a better experience.  Overall, I found this condition to be middle-of-the-road.  It was okay but I'm not likely to buy it again."

I bought this & the black vanilla shampoo & was very eager to use them. Unfortunately the pump on the conditioner wouldn't pop up when i twisted it. I tried for a few minutes to get the pump working but couldn't so i had to take off the cap & squeeze conditioner from the bottle in my hand. Way too much conditioner came out so i had to put back the excess. It's kinda inconvenient to not have a working pump because that's the best way to get the amount you need & not waste any. Not sure i'd be this online again. Would hate for this to happen a second time. Maybe it was just fluke :/

I didn't know my hair could look this good as with using the Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla conditioner and shampoo. I had been using the shampoo and loved it, but because of my allergies, don't trust conditioners. I finally gave in to temptation and bought the conditioner, and I am THRILLED with it!! I didn't know my hair could show curls and not be frizzy!! I thought my hair texture was frizzy!! IT'S NOT!! Carol's Daughter smoothed my hair and enhanced the curls SIGNIFICANTLY!! I mean, the love I have for this product...... I have been telling everyone in the world about these products and trying to force people to use them!!I read a lot of reviews on here, and I know this product was -originally- formulated for African American hair textures (the company has since been bought by L'Oreal and the formula has changed..... Sucks for the people who used to love it and it doesn't work for anymore!!), and I read a lot of reviews of the conditioner before I bought it. I didn't know for sure which reviewers were black and which were white to compare hair textures, so I just want to state that I'm a middle aged white woman with medium length wavy hair.

Let me tell you why: I shaved my head two months ago and my hair texture completely changed. It went from wavy to super thick with tight curls. Also I moved to Southern California so my hair is always dry. After I wash and apply product, no matter what it was my hair was always dry like a chip. 🙄 Okay, I used this product one time, and my hair has ALL THE MOISTURE. 😩🏌🏾  Prior to using this I wasn't even able to comb through my hair once it dried. My hair dried two hours ago and my comb is gliding!! And my hair is soft as ever. I'm going to buy this entire product line. There is magic in this bottle. I'm going to attach two pictures of my hair completely dry before and after using this magic.✨ My hair looks 100 times more hydrated, I'm in love."

Don't have to use a whole lot on my hair, smells amazing. I use it after I deep condition (10-30 mins) and will leave it in while I finish up my shower. (I have an odd out of order wash routine lol).If you have curly coily low porosity hair and you're struggling with persistent dryness, give the 4 in 1 combing creme in this brand's line a try before you grab this conditioner/shampoo.I do not recommend for a cowash, doesn't really have any cleansing properties that I can feel unless you add ACV to it or something. But their shampoo is pretty gentle in my opinion if you want to try that in place of a cowash."

It can make your hair feel oily after 2 weeks of use. Should also use with the same shampoo for best results, since I think the shampoo actually provides the moisture and this conditioner just seals in moisture very well."

May 2014 I dyed my hair  and once the new growth came in, I immediately regretted it.  My hair was extremely dry compared to what was coming in.  I bought this product at Target with little expectation because I have been a KeraCare fan since my relaxed days.  The only thing that could separate me from KeraCare was the fact that the local BSC where I buy the product was closed for the day- and my hair needed a wash bad!  Let me just say this- this product is fabulous!  It works wonders for my hair.  My hair feels so sleek and moisturized after conditioning.  My wash day regimen is a long process, mainly because detangling takes forever, but this product has shortened that time tremendously.  To top it all off the price is great and a little goes a long way.  My hair is super thick.  Normally it takes about 3-4 handfuls (dime sized amount- yea right LOL) of conditioner for me to get every strand; but, with this product I only need about 5-6 pumps and it's all the way through.  I usually wash with shampoo and conditioner, oil treatment with a plastic cap for about 30 minutes, and then this product for another 30 minutes.  My hair feels so soft and sleek and awesome afterwards!  I still use KeraCare, but I have definitely added this in to my regimen."

I went through the entire summer trying to figure out why my hair would have a gray looking film to it after washing it. The shampoo I used before this was thick and I had to dilute it with water to use it. I saw a review for this product on YouTube and I was intrigued. So I bought it and I'm so glad I did.This product is amazing for any type of locs. It leaves my hair squeaky clean, no film, no build up. No need to dilute it. Just get to work and it smells amazing. I use the Rose scented one for my hair and the Aloe Vera scent for my boys. After washing I immediately oil my scalp and my hair is good for another 2 weeks.My sister who has had sisterlocks for over 10 years tried it and she loves it as well. She uses it on her son and daughter who both have locs as well. Needless to say I give this product 5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

The two combined literally revived my dead, over-bleach blond hair and turned it into healthy, curly locks of gold... which I assumed was absolutely impossible. 😳 They say it only takes one wash.

It wasn't the case when I washed my daughter's hair and I think because the product is too watery and not thick you can easily get the impression that it's being washed away in your hair and you need to apply more than you should. For that, this is not for me or my family.We will keep buying the conditioner though. Even though I still found the scent too strong, I loved the cream based conditioner brilliant! Easier application to hair without it getting to your scalp and thick enough to make you feel the product is still being absorbed by your hair follicles."

The gel conditioner made me feel like I was in a spa and I was able to massage it into my scalp which I usually never do to avoid buildup at the roots, but it rinsed away clean!

It’s definitely a good cleanser. I really just hate the smell it’s so strong like relaxer cream. It’s intense. I wouldn’t buy it again for that reason

It reminded me of my late grandmothers perfume from the 90’s and it’s a waste. I usually like Carol’s Daughter products but this AND the conditioner is going in the trash.

I decided to test this product out because of the great reviews and the appealing ads. I purchased both the shampoo and the conditioner from my local Target, but I purchased the Aloe-scented one off of Amazon. I opened the lid of this rose-scented one to an unpleasant stench. At first you got a hint of rose, but it left a sour after-smell. It reminded me of the soap that I used for blowing bubbles as a child. I wish that I could give the scent column zero stars, and I will never purchase this product ever again. It left my hair greasy and made it harder for me to detangle. I would recommend buying the other wash day set with aloe and glyercin in it instead. It has a much better smell and left my hair softer. Would not recommend this one to anyone."

This is the first shampoo that does exactly what I need. It gets my hair so clean without leaving it feeling course and stripped. It just feels really clean but soft. I was hooked after the first use and it just keeps getting better. My hair and scalp feel clean and buildup/residues are no longer an issue. My hair is super shiney, has more body and less frizz and my conditioners and styling products seem to work better now that my hair is so clean. I get way better results on wash day and can go 4-5 days between washes just refreshing my hair daily. I use both the rose fragrance and the aloe and I love them both.

I have 4C hair, and there are so many products that promise to be compatible that aren't, all they do is dry you hair out, and sit on top of it making it gritty and harder to manage. Even the smell, I have really sensitive skin so the fact that is has a fragrance scared me even more, but to my pleasant surprise, the shampoo left my hair feeling clean, light, moisturized, and smelling amazing.I wash with the shampoo, then condition with the ""Carol's Daughter Detangling Jelly-to-Cream Conditioner With Glycerin and Rose Water, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair Paraben Free for Moisture, Hydration, and Shine, Curl Conditioner""I leave the conditioner in for 30 minutes with a plastic cap, rinse it out.Then massage in about 2 tablespoons of the ""Curly Hair Products by Carol's Daughter, Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter For Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair"".""Then massage in about a tablespoon of the ""Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair"", then let it air dry, and voila!"

My hair is very dry. I live this because I can literally apply the watery shampoo directly to my scalp from the bottle. (Do not try and put this on your hand and then put it in your hair, it's too thin.) I can give my scalp a scrub and then just rinse it through my hair. I don't notice the shampoo being moisturizing, but I'm using it on my scalp so I don't need it to be. I love the scent, it doesn't hang around long after you wash your hair, even if you use the corresponding conditioner."

Now I will say after I washed out the shampoo it was a little dry and I mean just a little and not enough to where you would have to add a ton of oil back to it but once I used the conditioner it was super soft! And to detangle was less of a hassle. I didn’t have to comb out too many knots. It was my first time using but I will be using again for sure!

I used Sheamoisture products for years as I lived in Los Angeles County which is really a desert. However, upon moving to the Mid-Atlantic I noticed that Sheamoisture products are a bit heavy for the Mid-Atlantic’s humid summers.  This shampoo is light, lathers well and rinses clean without stripping. It does not compromise my curls and has a very subtle rose scent.The matching conditioner is also excellent as it conditions without adding weight."

76,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Water-to-Foam Sulfate Free Vegan Shampoo with Rose Water and Micellar Technology, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Best for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fluid ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,I’m sold!!!,"Okay…so I saw a few people use the aloe one on social media and thought it looked interesting so I searched for it on Amazon. I had no idea they even had a Rose scented one. After reading on both the rose and aloe ones I decided to go ahead and try the rose since I absolutely love how roses smell. I washed my hair this morning using only the rose wash and nothing else. Whenever I try a new shampoo I use ONLY that shampoo so that I can truly see how it performs with my hair. Y’all…..between the luxurious rose scent, the nozzle tip making it easy to put directly on your scalp, the easy foam up lather, how light it felt on my hair and how easy it rinsed out…it felt I was getting my hair shampooed in a field in Italy on a warm summer day while my dog was napping next to my feet! Yes! I was THAT impressed! I normally use a clarifying shampoo followed by a moisturizing shampoo and I can honestly say that I’m 100% sure that this will only be the shampoo that I use from now on. My hair is only shoulder length but very thick and I have microlocs so it usually takes my hair 8 hours or longer to dry. Today it was dry after 2 hours. I was shocked but it also made sense because my other two shampoos were thick. Even when I diluted them it still too forever to wash out. Not this Wash Day Delight. It foamed up nicely and was light. I was hoping to keep this review short but I’m just so amazed at what I’ve seen with one wash of this. My hair is completely dry and it feels so good. It’s soft, smells amazing and my scalp doesn’t feel tight and dry. Also another thing I noticed…with any other shampoo, normal, clarifying or moisturizing, after I wash my hair is ALWAYS frizzy. Not today. That lets me know that my hair was not stripped and I’m loving it. No hot oil treatment needed. No conditioner needed. Just this one bottle. Some may be sensitive to the rose smell if smells bother you. But I love it! My whole house smells like roses now. Needless to say…I’m sold!!"

It makes mylocls have a sheen to them bc it leaves zero build up. Unfortunately, I had to give this bottle away bc I am sensitive to some smells and this one made me ill. My sister really likes it though. I went back to using the aloe version as I have no issues with the scent of that one and it has all the same benefits for me. Highly recommended if you notice that other shampoos or conditioners cause a dusty haze on your locs."

It was sleek and made my tight coils loosen and smooth out also a nice smell. BUT once out of the shower and once the steam cleared from my mirror I was in shock. My hair looked dull, dry, and frizzy and felt rough to the touch, the exact opposite of how it felt in the shower. This was the first time I had to reapply water to my hair after a shower to complete the ""O"" from the ""L.O.C"" system my hair was so dry. This was a lesson to me to read the ingredients before I purchase; the 1st ingredient is glycerin, 2nd ingredient is water, 3rd ingredient is alchohol...enough said."

The smell washes out very subtle and does not bother my skin or migraine sensitivities which is awesome.  I would hate not being able to use this because it is a great product.  I really feel it detangled my hair and just completely transformed it without being a typical sort of conditioners.  Im im pressed.  PS...I have very curly naturally dreading fine hair

I used to use Nexus Humectress which was bought out by a big conglomerate, had its formula changed, and was RUINED (I’m still mad).  I have protein-sensitive hair and this is basically pure glycerin (#1 ingredient even ahead of water) so it detangles and moisturizes GREAT without any buildup.  I searched and searched for something new after Nexus and this is it!!!!  I have long, blond, fine, wavy, low-porosity hair.  If you do too, then this is for you.  The scent is strong but attractive and not perfumy, and it dissipates quickly.  I love it.Amazon, however, can’t seem to figure out how to ship this, so I will occasionally get a container that leaks.  I may have to stop ordering and go buy local if they don’t get it together soon."

This is the WORST possible container for a product you're trying to use in the shower, unless you're in a different tax bracket and have a huge spa shower with a HUGE ledge to put this damn thing back on to."

In my opinion, the fragrance of this conditioner is wonderful. However, some might find it a bit strong. It depends on how how your sense of smell is. I let  this conditioned sit in my hair for a few minutes and washed it out. I didn't have to wait 20 or 30 minutes for it to sit in my hair. I loved that! As I combed through my hair, I found that the slip was good!  My hair felt rejuvenated and moisturized like it had a  spa day. I loved seeing my defined (4A) curls afterwards. My hair was satisfied and I am too."

It gets very tangled even in a bun. I can’t believe I went all this time without this product. Probably because I didn’t care for the shampoo. My niece got the rose set but the scent was so overwhelming. I loved the conditioner tho so I decided to try this scent. It’s not as strong.

Not enough moisture,"Absolutely trash. It has a thick consistency, but it takes forever to penetrate the hair and once rinsed, it leaves hair feeling coated. Not enough moisture for 4C hair. The shampoo left my hair a tangled mess as well. Carol's daughter should have advertised this as a clarifying duo because it is much too harsh for drier hair textures."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Detangling Jelly-To-Cream Conditioner with Glycerin and Aloe, Paraben-Free for Moisture, Hydration and Shine, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair with Aloe, 20 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing results,"I purchased this conditioner to use for my first wash day after having my hair blow dried and flat ironed for about 2 weeks. my hair is natural with no relaxers or color dye. My hair is susceptible to heat damage very easily and I only straighten my hair about once a year. After deep conditioning with this amazing conditioner my curls have come back stronger than ever!! I am truly impressed with the quality, size, and cost.  It is definitely a unique and different texture than most conditioners, in my opinion it is a bit heavier, But I had no issue with is after i got used to it and especially after rinsing and seeing how much moister was retained in my hair."

My hair is on the thinner side, but it have a lot of it. Before I was using Pantene moisture renewal and my hair was weighed down,greasy, and my curls were flat. After using this set my hair instantly felt clean, soft, and smells so fresh. I can go like 3 days without washing my hair and my curls are so bouncy. To refresh them all I do is fill a spray bottle with warm water and add a bit of the conditioner to it and spray my hair. Would 100 percent recommend this product!!"

80,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Detangling Jelly-To-Cream Conditioner with Glycerin and Aloe, Paraben-Free for Moisture, Hydration and Shine, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair with Aloe, 20 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,I don’t know if maybe I got a bad batch or what? But my experience with this Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Detangling Jelly-To-Cream Conditioner (Aloe) is nothing like what it says on the label. I followed the instructions exactly and I’m now sitting here writing this review with the waxiest hair of my life. I even spent extra time in the shower trying to rinse this stuff out and my hair is still coated with this thick wax-like film. I brushed my wet hair and pulled it back into a ponytail and my hair is like molded into place now. This stuff is unreal. I’m going to have to re-wash my hair to get it out and back to normal. This is so bizarre. Not at all what I was expecting from this conditioner. There’s no way this is how this product is supposed to perform. All I gotta say is buy with caution. Maybe just go for the shampoo and not the conditioner.
81,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Detangling Jelly-To-Cream Conditioner with Glycerin and Aloe, Paraben-Free for Moisture, Hydration and Shine, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair with Aloe, 20 Oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I found it confusing that the other reviews talked about shampoo--this is a conditioner, not a shampoo. I just wanted to make sure that anyone reading this would know. There is a companion product that is the shampoo that is intended to be used before this conditioner, but this is just the conditioner.That said (or clarified) I did enjoy using this. It has a nice, clean scent on the herbal side and while in the shower, it did glide through my hair and make it feel smoother. But once I got out of the shower and dried my hair, it wasn't as free from tangles or as soft as I had hoped. I have thinning, very dry and brittle hair so I had hoped this would help with some of that. It did--a little--and worked better than other conditioners I've tried, but it didn't prevent me from having to apply a bit of leave-in hair oil to really help with tangles, dryness, and lack of luster. Mind you, it helped and it helped a lot more than other conditioners I've tried, but it wasn't the total solution for me. I'm still using Moroccan hair oil so that I can comb out the tangles in my hair after washing it.So overall, it's a good conditioner. It smells nice and does help detangle hair in the shower, but in the end, I still need hair oil to give my old, brittle hair some shine and softness."
82,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Detangling Jelly-To-Cream Conditioner with Glycerin and Aloe, Paraben-Free for Moisture, Hydration and Shine, Moisturizing Conditioner for Curly Hair with Aloe, 20 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,This detangling conditioner is a decent value for the money because of the generous amount of product that comes in this large container. This moisturizing jelly is easy to apply and instantly softens hair and releases tangles. It makes my hair shinier and easier to comb and brush through. I like the crisp and invigorating scent of this. The scent reminds me of a botanical rainforest. I like that this contains aloe foe its moisturizing and nourishing benefits.

My daughter is mixed and I find this line to be the best for her. Another popular brand ends up drying her hair out even more. That's not the case with Carol's Daughter. This product included. I was still doubtful, before the product arrived, because the other brand I mentioned has a jelly-type curl product that was a no-go and I thought this might be like that. It's not. It's so great. The texture is so nice and works into her hair really well. Feels conditioning as it's sitting on her hair and is very helpful with combing and detangling her curls. Afterward her hair looks and feels hydrated. Leaves it shiny and healthy looking. Smells fresh, a little citrusy. Love it, another product that we will be buying on the regular now!"

This Jelly to Cream conditioner is sadly one I am not a fan of. For one I am just not crazy about the fragrance. There is just something that I am not crazy about.The texture of it is different and takes some getting used to but I just didn't like how it felt in my hair even once it became more conditioner like. Once it was rinsed out my hair still felt a little weird to be honest and just felt like it had some residue on it. All in all not happy with this one and am going to pass on it."

I have to say that I was disappointed in how it performed on my relaxed hair. I am transitioning and I noticed that it does great on my natural hair or regrow that. It softens and smells wonderful and moisturizes well. However my ends did not respond well to this conditioner as it still felt dry and stringy. It could be due to the nature of my relaxed hair being damaged beyond repair. The conditioner is pretty thick and changes from a gel to a cream as you rub it in your hands. It’s very thick. It may best benefit those that are truly natural with hair that’s already in healthy states.

This product, Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight jelly-to-cream conditioner has a strong organic smell, which I really didn't care for..  You need a lot of product for it to be effective, and I found that it did not condition my hair, nor did it help with detangling (quite the opposite).  It has glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and a lot of other ingredients, most of which aren't that slippery or hydrating.  I also don't like having to dip my fingers into the container.  I've never disliked any conditioner as much as I did this one, and I can't recommend it."

Here are my main reasonings to why:-The smell is amazing! I wish I could describe it but it’s kind of like a sweet coconut flower scent.-The consistency is nice and holds good! It has the potential to keep the moisture locked in your curls if used correctly.-I like to use as a leave in as it gives my curls a beautiful definition-works good with my other curly hair products as well!I am very much interested in trying more from this collection.

I LOVE this.  It was a little strange to apply it to my hair but it really did work VERY well to get rid of the tangles.  It does not seem to be the most hydrating  - my hair feels like it has no product in it but my hair is really soft and touchable.  It is a little frizzy - I would add a styling product to cut down on the frizziness but I normally use a product to style after my shower.The amount of time it saved in the shower, and the amount of breakage it prevented makes it hugely worth it.  2 thumbs up"

I've used Carol's Daughter stuff before, most of it I've liked well enough, so while I was excited to try this, I was completely underwhelmed. I found it to be too thick, more like petroleum jelly, and my hair did not react well to it either. I tried a couple times, following the instructions, just to be sure I was doing it right and giving it a fair chance, but this ended up drying out my hair, made it a bit rough, and it really isn't for me."

I had been waiting to try this until I finished that off but my hair was getting worse. Within two days of using my hair was back to normal - soft, tangle free, shiny, and well moisturized. The consistency of this product is different but really so much better than traditional conditioner. It’s thick like petroleum jelly but not greasy. It glides over every single strand and cover it so well! It smells amazing too! I’m fully converted to this conditioner and highly recommended it."

I rinsed it, but after I blow dried it left a sticky residue; the stickiness went away after straightening but I’m use to a softer texture. It left it super shiny... the pic is my hair after washing with no product added.Though I like the sheen, I prefer a lighter, soft, more fluffy texture so I won’t use again for straightened styling. I will use again for my daughter’s hair.  She wears her hair in a naturally curly state.It smells very good!"

My 2b/2c hair is extremely dry, coarse, damaged and brittle. Any sort of shampoo, even low poos and very mild surfactants, makes my hair feel like straw and turns it into a complete tangled mess.This shampoo is so good that I can run my fingers through my hair as I rinse it out, something I've never been able to do with shampoo. It's very thick like honey and lathers very well so a little goes a long way. I have long hair and I use maybe 2 pumps. My hair is wavy and I find this doesn't weigh it down at all, but my hair is also very thirsty and porous.This is the ONLY shampoo I will use between clarifying as it does not strip or tangle my hair and also effectively cleans it. It smells heavenly too. For those with coarse damaged hair I highly reccomend adding the hair oil to your routine as well."

I had to to take the pump dispenser out of the bottle and shake it into my palm to get out the shampoo which was difficult because it it quite thick . That's a pain . If the dispenser problem could be remedied and put it in a bigger bottle I would be over the moon !"
7,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok,"It's not a bad shampoo by any means. If you like the scent this just might be the stuff for you. For me, it was a little difficult to get the pump working. I think I would prefer a regular pour cap top. It doesn't lather that heavily, and yes, I know, this is not any indication of how well it works. It is just that if you grew up with very lathery shampoo this might take some getting used to, I am not fond of the scent, which feels too thick and too heavy to me. After washing my hair it felt ok, as in: not bad. After my hair had fully dried, however, and I took a brush to my head, my hair turned out to feel silky and smooth like a very expensive coat. I like that alright. But probably not well enough to put up with the packaging and the smell. Earlier this year I reviewed another strongly perfumed vanilla scented shampoo, and for what it's worth, if I were going to over look the scent I would probably go back for that one. Or just buy a different high quality shampoo that is unscented, or has a less overpowering scent."
8,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,A scent that lasts,"This is the thickest shampoo. it's almost like a gel, and I was glad it came with a pump top, instead of the squeeze type. You can smell it as soon as it comes out of the bottle, and if you like vanilla scent, you'll like this.Next came the lather. A little bit goes a long way! I'm used to needing a lot more shampoo (I have long hair), but what I normally use was more than enough on my first use. I learned I didn't need as much from then on.I can smell this shampoo even after I've rinsed, and dried my hair. I can smell it for a few hours afterwards too.As a shampoo, it lathers great, moisturizes better than most, and leaves my hair smelling good."
9,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as other CD products,"I enjoy several other Carol’s Daughter products, including the Curl Refresher Spray and Curl Defining Butter/Cream, so I had high hopes for this shampoo. The only thing it has going for it though, is it smells delicious.I usually prefer a squeeze/pour bottle to a pump, and this pump doesn’t even operate easily. It operates kind of tightly. Not a lot comes out each pump, so my fairly short hair takes at least 6 (difficult) pumps. I doubt I’ll even use the whole bottle because the pump issue is going to get annoying real fast. It’s also not nearly as moisturizing as Suave Moroccan Infusion, which costs 1/3 as much as this."
10,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me...,"I’m pretty middle of the line when it comes to shampoos, I only wash my hair once a week so I’m typically not too choosy. This product, however, didn’t do much for me. First off, the pump was broken, and then after a few weeks of use I got some dandruff (which is completely unusual for me, and this was the only new hair product I had been using). After I stopped using this the dandruff went away. Maybe this works for others, but for me it’s a no. (By the way I have course, color treated, long hair)."
11,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome - the best! Packaging could use help though :),"Product is great! My hair and scalp are in so much better condition with this brand! No more flaky residue left behind, and my scalp doesn’t itch anymore. I love the scent as well.I took 1 star off because of the packaging. I keep getting shipments where it leaked some during shipping. It’s just enough to get the bag yucky (but smelling great, haha). However this one was packaged so poorly the pump broke during shipment. I’ll just reuse the pump from my previous bottle. But it’s frustrating that the bottle is just thrown into the box with other items. Not like the delivery guy/gal is really careful with the box either, lol! Perhaps it’s better to order this separately, and hold off on the other things I probably don’t need anyway, lol!"

I started using this shampoo with the black vanilla conditioner and my curls are really responding well. I have between a 2C and 3A curl and this shampoo is cleansing and does not dry out my hair in the least. I absolutely cannot get over how nice the smell is though- every shower feels like a spa day
13,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Cleansing Shampoo,After one wash this shampoo had my hair feeling lighter and less greasy. It was like it had stripped my hair of all the crap built up from cheap products I've used. It also smells amazing. I look forward to trying out other Carol's Daughter products.Only complaint I have (which isn't a big deal at all) is that I had a hard time getting the dispenser pump to work at first.
14,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for children,I do not recommend this product for children. My daughter is half black and mexican almost 5 years old and I used this product for two weeks and it dried her hair out. Dried out the ends. I had to purchase another product to restore her hair.  Maybe it should only be for adults.

No build up, no squeaky hair or scalp. Just clean locs, scalp and a very faint fragrance left on them. It isn't too harsh either. It does take a while to lather (loc'd hair is hard to lather in general) but it does it after a few passes. I love it and will buy again."

17,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Haircare staple,"I try to use more natural/less chemical products when I can find really great ones, and this shampoo is the one thing I keep coming back to in the Black Vanilla line (tried the conditioner and detangler but wasn't a huge fan). My hair gets greasy with the wrong products, but this formula leaves it feeling completely clean but soft and not stripped of its moisture. One thing to note -- it doesn't lather as much as a shampoo with sulfates, so you may have to use a little more than usual for long hair like mine (or mix it with a conventional shampoo if you like the sudsy feeling). It really does leave your hair feeling hydrated and is one of the only shampoos that gives me noticeable shine."
18,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!,I noticed my hair was falling out a lot in February--due to stress. I started taking collagen and pairing it with this shampoo/conditioner and noticed my hair started to fall out less and less. I didn't purchase this shampoo set until March so within 1 month my hair has drastically changed. I got rid of all the shampoos and soaps that have all those unnecessary chemicals and will only use shampoos like this! I also saw you can purchase this in Target!

I really wanted to like it. However, after a couple of washes, I began to feel that my scalp was irritated. I do have a sensitive scalp. Perhaps the fragrance causes irritation. I am not sure. It is really a pity because I love the vanilla smell, part of what attracted me to the line, and the fact that is a curly girl approved line."

I really wanted to love it because of its lavish vanilla scent but it simply left my hair coarse and dull. I've never had that problem with other sulfate free shampoos. I even had to use clarifying shampoo to get rid of the build up it left behind. Sad, because of all the positive reviews."

I've had to hunt it down since then, and have a couple bottles in the cabinet. The smell is amazing. On my hair it is super hydrating, but I don't know how it would be on other hair types (I'm white). I also use it on my face periodically because it's so hydrating. I try to use it sparingly, though because I'm usually pretty frugal and don't spend this much on a bottle of shampoo but it's definitely worth the treat."

I have very long, coarse hair. Sulfide laden shampoo causes my hair to become brittle and break more, It also strips too much of the natural oils from my hair so everything is just gross by the end of the day. This shampoo not only smells delicious, but it leaves my hair softer and clean without residue or stripping. I only wash my hair about once a week so things have been a lot more manageable since discovering this one."

We use this line on our 3yo son and it leaves his hair smelling so good. I've noticed people sniffing his hair when they hug him. Lol it leaves his hair so soft and manageable. I wish they had a product for dryer hair but.😭

I am 5 years into my loc journey and I absolutely love the leave-in conditioning spray. It leaves my locs smelling amazing, moisturized, and gives it a healthy shine. I figured the shampoo would yield similar results so I ordered both products. Excited to see how it goes. I was worried about the packaging due to some of the reviews but my products came perfect!"

73,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,I really wanted to like this. I have thick,"I really wanted to like this. I have thick, coarse, 2a-2b curly hair that I am finally wearing naturally (instead of straightening it) and wanted this shampoo since it is sulfate free. I'm not sure if I got a messed up bottle, but the product I received was ridiculously thick and sticky, almost like molasses. As such, I could not get it to permeate the top layer of my hair. I had to use about 15 pumps to get my hair even halfway clean (it was still oily afterward, probably because I couldn't stand trying to make this syrup shampoo work and gave up). I even tried mixing water into the shampoo, and it was still sticky.I know several other reviewers mentioned that their bottles were opened, and mine was too. The shampoo leaked in the shipping box (which had other items in it as well). Not sure why this is such a prevalent issue with this product.As far as the smell (another issue in many other reviews), I liked it, but can understand why others didn't. The scent is kind of overpowering (the other items that shipped in that box still smell like this!), and very vanilla-y, so if you don't really like the smell of vanilla, don't buy this.Overall, I can't recommend this product. Like I said, this may have been a bad batch or something. If every bottle was like the one I received, I'd find it difficult to believe this product had good reviews."

240,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good and that's it,"I ordered this shampoo and conditioner as an alternative to sulfate containing shampoos that I suspected were causing my hair to thin. After using the product for about 3 weeks I noticed my scalp was feeling dry and tight. I used it on my daughter too and noticed that she has been itching the back of her head so much she started to break the skin. After about 2 minutes of internet research I found out that while the shampoo says it does not contain sulfates, it contains other ingredients that act in the same way. Before switching, mind you, I was not having a reaction to other shampoos, just though a sulfate free shampoo would be better, healthier choice (less chemicals) for me. Of course, I end up having a reaction.  That is extremely disappointing to me and the main reason I will discontinue the use of these products. I gave 1 star because it does smell good, but that's it. It didn't do anything miraculous for my hair and definitely didn't do my scalp any favors."

I have very long hair which is a problem as long hair takes special care to keep it looking good. I have been paying huge money for Paul Mitchell Ginger shampoo that is sulfate free. I love Paul Mitchell, but let's face it, it is very expensive. I have tried MANY shampoos that are sulfate free and they all made my hair feel very heavy and look greasy within a day. This shampoo works just as well on my hair and scalp as my beloved Paul Mitchell shampoo and I love it. My hair is very soft and manageable. I also use the conditioner on the lower half of my hair (that is the part that always needs conditioning when your hair is long) and I love that as well."

It smells delightful, although the smell doesn't linger heavily like the other reviewers said (which disappointed me, since I love vanilla!). That being said, this is the first time I've used a non-sulfate shampoo, and I love what it's done for my hair. It's much shinier and smoother now right after a wash, whereas before my hair would be puffy and frizzy after a shampoo. I think the gentle nature of this shampoo has made my hair healthier. I also love the pump feature (so much easier to get your shampoo out) and I love that it still foams up, even though I've read non-sulfate shampoos normally don't. I've had this bottle for over a month now and I easily still have 4/5 left to use, so I think it'll last me a good while (although I do only shampoo my hair every 2 or 3 days)."

Once i towel dried my hair I was shocked to see it made it hard, super super dry and brittle. I purposely didn't use condition because i wanted to test the product by itself. Once my hair it was a giant hard frizzy puff and i have straight sleek hair naturally. It's nowhere near close to being a mild cleanser it's very strong and stripped all good oil out. I had to take another shower and use john frieda to reverse the damage. I wanted this to work so bad but I've honestly never seen a shampoo destroy hair like that."

By the third week it made my curls course and difficult to comb out.  I should have stopped using it but decided to try one more time. My hair was a tangled mess that took forever to comb out resulting in more than normal hair loss. I will never buy again.

For all kinds of hair!","Carol's daughter products are made for hair that is coarser and curly - mine is straight fine blond hair, and I love this Shampoo and Conditioner. It makes my hair feel clean, smell great and look quite shiny. I have purchased this several times, as well as other items from the same line. No sulphates is really nice, as sulphates are so drying. You do not get as many suds, but it does suds up a bit and your hair will look fabulous!Also, this line does not have parabens (wax) or silicone in any of their products. I used to use products that had this stuff in it and it did make my hair look good - it coats the hair and keeps the cuticle down, BUT the waxes are hard and make the hair brittle and there is more breakage.I only buy and use products that do not have silicone or parabens - Carol's Daughter is great for my fine, blonde, straight hair."

I stopped all my other hair care products, because I wanted to get the full experience. When I first put the Black Vanilla shampoo on my hair I noticed right away that my hair felt tangled and matted. I proceeded with the conditioner and my hair felt really nice, and the slip was good. After washing out the conditioner my hair was rough, matted and tangled. I used the mimosa hair dressing and curl creme. Days after, my hair was dry and still very rough. I decided to keep using it and figured my hair needed to get used to it. The end of Feburary ('20), after washing and using the conditioner my hair fell out in clumps, my edges are gone and my hair is thin and still tangled and rough. I also no longer have the same curly hair texture, my curls are gone. I was devastated because I wanted to like this product and give it a chance. My hair was to the middle of my back, and now it barely touches my shoulders. I ""had"" a head full of strong, thick, natural, healthy curly hair and had never experienced this with any product before. I normally dont write reviews, but figured this review may have been experienced by someone else. Although majority of people may have good experiences, I was one of the few that didn't have that opportunity to say this worked. I will no longer use Carol's Daughter, but I'm also not trying to discourage others from trying it."

I have color treated hair and this shampoo and conditioner dried it out so much that for the first time in my life I had itchy scalp and dandruff. The smell is amazing which is important to me as someone who has issues with scent. I like that it doesn’t have a lot of crap in it that’s bad for your hair, but I think it’s just not meant for color treated hair. I didn’t like that I needed a lot to get a decent lather, but that is preference, not necessarily a bad thing about the product. While my scalp got dried out, my hair did feel soft, but it changed the texture enough that I had difficulty styling it the way I usually do. I would just recommend that if you have color treated hair to steer clear."
346,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Somewhat Comparable to Redken All Soft In Terms of Results,"This is an all-around good shampoo that leaves my color-treated hair feeling clean, but not overly stripped, or the opposite which is probably worse (gummy and heavy with buildup, as cheap shampoos tend to do). It's pleasantly scented like warm vanilla...it leans a little toward the feminine side for sure, but it's subtle enough once it dries that a bro could use it. The pump bottle is convenient, although mine leaks quite a bit if it's not held upright. For comparison, I typically use Redken All Soft which is twice the price, and while I wouldn't say this is every bit as good (my hair doesn't feel quite as soft or totally frizz-free as with All Soft), it's close enough that I would buy it again, or maybe alternate it with All Soft to get more mileage out of each bottle. With a quick smoothing treatment after straightening, you probably wouldn't be able to tell a difference. I used this in conduction with the Black Vanilla Hair Smoothie, which I would rate higher than the shampoo....both products were the first time I'd tried Carol's Daughter products, and I am pleased.UPDATE: After using this product exclusively for a few weeks, my hair is drier, frizzier, and more difficult to brush. I don't think I'll repurchase."

All the products in this line smelling amazing, it makes my scalp feel so nice and everything gets clean without getting overly dry. And I'm thankful it doesn't take so much. My husband was nervously staring at his wallet for a while. I've used it a few times now since I bought it and it's not even halfway like most of my other shampoos would be.Now I'm not saying my hair feels super moisturized and soft after this shampoo. It still cleans everything off like it's supposed to. But I don't end up feeling like steel wool, ok? The conditioner in this line is lovely~"

The reviews are true, it really does smell AMAZING. I kept getting wafts of vanilla as I moved around. My hair is soft and smells nice. I didn't have any issues getting the shampoo to lather. I have wavy hair, and after brushing it and letting it air dry...the texture seemed different. Maybe a bit less frizz (but not a lot). I expect good things for styling my hair after using this. I bought it because my mom is called Carol, and I was looking for a sulfate free combo.FYI Wal-Mart sells this in the Ethnic Hair section for just under $10 a bottle."

Hissssssss!,"Literally the very worst shampoo I have ever used. The bottle claims to add 80% more moisture. I don’t know for who, because it stripped my hair of moisture so badly that I will be lucky not to have to bc it. I purchased it, along with the conditioner and mask from the Carol's Daughter website. I call foul, because I tried to leave a review about my poor experience with all 3 products, & they refused to publish it.

352,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Use Less fragrance!,"This shampoo is very moisturizing and cleans well. I've used a variety of CD shampoos and I think they are the best sulfate-free shampoos on the market- some can feel a little drying but all clean very well. This shampoo provides most of the moisture in the black vanilla line, which is sealed in by the conditioner. It would be better if they didn't use fragrance though or at least as much as they do. Fragrance is very high on the ingredients list, which scares me since I know there are many chemicals in fragrance that can irritate the scalp and possibly cause hair loss. Unfortunately, if you want to use the conditioner you should also use this shampoo for best results."

Initially I was out to purchase Giovanni because of all of the rave reviews, but opted for this product.Every claim it was supposed to fulfill, it did the opposite of. The shampoo stripped my hair, in turn tangling it very badly. I had hoped the conditioner would repair the issue, but it did nothing of the sort. Left my hair so stringy and knotted, I had to go out and buy another shampoo and conditioner (Aussie Moist) to make up for what this didn't do, which worked out much better for me.I wouldn't recommend this product for those with kinky and/or curly hair, given our hair doesn't produce as much oil as those with straighter hair. So it may strip your hair of all the moisture it needs while also failing to compensate for the loss of moisture.(Also: I had watched a review on YouTube by DSFAVORS and read the responses. I wished I had checked it out prior to purchasing, because apparently I'm not the only one with such horrible results.)"

My hair has always been super thick, super black and always frizzy. Recently I've been trying EVERYTHING! Why do I have this horrible hair that does nothing but make me hot and looks like I have a giant poodle on my head? Why can't I have soft flowy non frizzy hair? And can for the love of everything holy, can the ends STOP feeling like straw? I could probably scratch you with the ends of my hair. So dry. And the shampoos and conditioning that say ""moisture""... Lies! All lies! My hair is as thirsty as that girl that's throwing herself at every guy in the bar. The only difference though... My hair gets nothing. Not even a promise of any of those things I listed above. I just don't understand what's wrong with my hair! I've tried dove, garnier, tresme, salon grade stuff... Ogx and stuff from lush the list goes on and on. My co worker the other day looks at me and says "" you have that thick coarse Mexican Indian hair."" Me ""yea.. And it's horrible"". She then tells me to use this stuff. And I'm like but that's not made for my type of hair. And she looks at me ""Don't fool yourself, your hair is just as bad as mine used to be."" But my coworkers hair is so shiny and looks well behaved. And it looks like it's ""in place"". Me "" whaa? You? Your hair is so pretty though"". So I go to Target and buy this stuff. It's with all the natural hair products, the section that I've never shopped in because well it's for natural hair and I'm far from that hair type. So I thought. I buy the shampoo and conditioner, jump in the shower. I love the smell right? Okay. But will you make my hair soft? And hydrated? Because nothing has worked! The shampoo is thick and it almost feels like a conditioner, it's a dark Amber color and I smear it all over my hair. Thick and dry and Tangled. And it doesn't lather so good but I continue working into my scalp. Rinse and follow with step two. It's thick and creamy and coats my locks. I leave it in for like maybe 5 min and continue with my shower. I rinse get out, and that's when the magic happens. Yes. Magic! Why?! Because when my hair was 70%dry I could already feel a BIG HUGE difference... I could run my fingers through my hair! Run them right through. OMG! It's been known to snap hair brushes in half on multiple occasions. But here I am combing my fingers through​ my hair. All day, listen all day my hair is calm it's shiny it feels light weight which is a first in the 28 years on this Earth it feels light weight! OMG who's hair is this? It looks like I blow dried it straight with a slight wave but there is absolutely no kinks no frizz and it's shiny. I actually cried. It's been forever my whole life I thought I had bad hair. No. Bad products. Period. Im already in love with the product and I will invest in this line. Thank you to whom ever made this and thank you to my co worker. OMG best thing she's ever told me. Buy this. Buy this if you're white, brown, black, yellow red whatever... You have hair that you think is bad... Buy this! Right now. Just hit that buy now button! Or go to the store, this is everywhere! Why wait? Buy it!"

It is so mildly cleansing so is is safe for my bleached blonde, curly, biracial hair and my sulfate allergy. No itching, no scalp irritation and leaves my hair moisturized but clean. This stuff is so natural that it doesn't leave much scent/fragrance on your hair so you might smell..human rather than like perfume. Which is what I very much prefer, otherwise I don't feel cleaned, just covered up with extra fragrance. That being said, it smells AMAZING. Gentle enough so I can wash my hair more often and not worry about overly drying."

I used to use One 'n' Only Argan Oil Shampoo & Conditioner (which didn't give me the look I was going for but made my hair soft) until I discovered Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Shampoo & Conditioner.

With other shampoos I can wash every other day, with this I have to wash daily and still doesn't leave my hair feeling clean.  For the price I expected better.  It doesn't lather well either."

After one way my hair wad so tangled and dry, I felt that the shampoo stripped what little bit of moisture out of my hair."

As someone with a sensitive scalp and recurring eczema, this shampoo leaves my hair clean and my scalp feeling healthy. That being said, I haven't noticed any extra moisture or shine, or reduced hair fallout. It's not a miracle-worker, but it's a great shampoo."
381,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,PRETTY GOOD OVERALL .. leftover smell is bit annoying,"Feels great, suds up well comparatively being a sulphate free product. I got a sample from Target store and used it this morning. Hair is feeling silky with the use of shampoo & conditioner. The only thing that's annoying is the leftover smell, though I love vanilla products, this one has a sort of annoying aroma once the hair dries up. You might want to consider Shea & Coconut-Hibiscus shampoo, another amazing, sulphate free product for hair, that suds up well and leaves you with silky hair."

I bought it at Sallys when it was on sale. I've been using it about 3 weeks now and at first, thought my hair was thinning out or something. I was getting concerned. But, I realized its because my hair is so smooth and silky from this shampoo that my fingers run through it effortlessly! I use the leave in conditioner too which is okay, I don't really like the sticky residue it leaves in my hair though. I normally use argan oil and I don't even have to with this! Its shiny, smooth, silky and no tangles. Love it!"

You know how sometimes the product still gets in your eyes anyway and it stings a bit? Well, I'm here to tell you, KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF YOUR EYES! This shampoo burns so bad that you will hate yourself and your life for like 10 minutes after you've finished using it. It will have you question every decision you've ever made in your life that led you to this point in your life where you're faced with having to make a quick decision on whether to try to wash the shampoo out with water or just punch the eye out of your socket. Otherwise, this shampoo is not very stripping, cleanses well, and smells very nice. Definitely works well with the corresponding condish."

It may work for some but it stripped my hair and made it until manageable. Would never purchase again.  Also am not a super fan of the scent... or of CD in general... overpriced imo. I do like the hair balm it performs well but it smells and feels like tcb hair grease from the 70's/80's.  Side eye...

402,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Sulfate Free Shampoo For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Rose, Paraben Free Shampoo, 12 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells heavenly!,"I love this product! This is one of my favorite sulfate free shampoos. Let me start by saying this stuff smells AMAZING! The smell lasts all day in my experience. I'll be walking down the hall at work and get a waft of a light sweet vanilla, and it's wonderful. It does lather a little more than other sulfate free shampoos, but I don't mind it and I free it's much gentler on my hair than a sulfate based shampoo. I do like the ""pump"" on this bottle, as the shampoo is a little thinner than sulfate based shampoos. I also like that I see like little bits of what appear to be lavender flowers when I pump the shampoo into my hand. My only complaint is that I have a LOT of hair and I do feel that I have to use more this shampoo compared to others. My hair feels softer and less frizzy after I wash my hair with this. I also dye my hair and I do not feel that this shampoo fades my dye. Overall I think this is a great shampoo that you should add to shower caddy."

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"

It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I have bouncy curls now!,"I never thought I could just let my curls air dry and be done, but with this hair mask that is very much possible! I’m so happy with my purchase! I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"

6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."

If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."

It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."

BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This actually works !,"So I have the worst dry hair. Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but didn’t deliver,"I am trying to find something less expensive than Kinky Curls custard. Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."

15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."

I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"
18,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Coco Creme EXCELLENT Product!,I love Carols Daughter products and was happy to see the launch of the Coco Creme line.  I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.

I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"
23,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only Carol's Daughter Product I use,"I've purchased Carol's Daughter products in the past and many of them were average, for me.  Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."

I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."

29,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."
30,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like old spice, but my hair feels great!","I’ve used the original hair milk in the past and really liked it, so I decided to try the coco creme hair mask.This does not smell like coco or cream or any combination of the two. The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."

This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it.

I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

I am obsessed w the Black Vanilla shampoo & conditioner,  so I decided to try this one and it was like the total opposite.My hair turned out feeling like hay, wouldnt style easily, nor detangle well.

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming. The intensity of the chemical smell plus coconut  did reduced overnight but not enough. To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

I’ve used this a month now in addition to other products because I don’t like my hair poofy. 1 jar does last me a month with every day use, a little goes a long way with this product. 4 stars because of the price and I can’t give 4.5."

My hair went from mostly moisturized to frizzy, DRY (it actually began to crackle and break), my curl pattern became kinky instead of spirals. This isn't for dry hair. This isn't for anybody's hair, really."

I have 4c low porosity hair, and I used the Cantu leave-in before this one and it worked well for me but I wanted to find a moisturizer that is black-owned and works just as well. Guess I'll keep looking cuz this one ain't it."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

I can even use it without a conditioner(I try not to!), and it still tames everything down.For me it's worth it, and I hope they never stop making it.

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

Its very moisturizing my looked amazing after i used it. But Oh. My. Gosh. The smell is infuriating it gave me horrible headaches and lasted for days. I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

It isn't overpowering once you wash it all off but when you have it on it feels excessive. I use it about once a week or every two weeks and I really don't find much of a difference in my hair, it gives *some* moisturization but I prefer other masks I've tried."

It's soft- it makes my hair Softer and it's super Moisturizering. For anyone like me who doesn't know what to use on your hair, go to a natural hair salon and get a hair consultation. They're usual free. It's okay to ask a professional. And there is a difference between this - a pudding- the hair Milk (also a great product) a cream."

Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

620,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."

But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

So glad I found this hair product.

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

I really like this company. I love that their products, like this one, has NO silicones, parabens, petroleum, mineral oil or artificial colors.  I find the fragrance of this one to be light and refreshing overall. Not overpowering for a man and I believe lots of women will also enjoy it.  Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.  I honestly have received and reviewed many different shampoo and conditioner products from different companies. Carols daughter is one of my favorite. This is a company I would buy from again."

But as it drys your skin feels awesome. When I googled where to buy, is when I discovered it was for your hair. WHAT A LAUGH I HAD. Sorry but I'm going to use it all over. It's great.

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

But I love the product so much that I can put up with the smell. I put a good amount of gel on my wet hair as it is long and curly. It sure is gel...slimy and all. But it works. I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

I have super dry, thick, frizzy hair and it works great. I was so glad to finally try their sulfate-free shampoo too. I have been using Deva-Curl NoPoo Shampoo and it works great, but I like to change up my shampoo and not use the same one all the time.

You only really need one squirt for medium length hair. Smells great too! Love it!"

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

Even after just one use you can see and feel the results. My hair looks so healthy and has a shine that it didn’t before. This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

My hair is so naturally dry I don't even rinse the conditioner out; I just gently work the conditioner down to my ends and squeeze out the conditioner with the excess water. This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo. The pump is handy. I prefer for my conditioner to have a pump so I can measure each time I use it (3 pumps).

The mask itself is very thick and silky feeling and absorbs quickly into the hair.  Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.

Rhassoul Clay

   shampoo and conditioner for months now, and I really like those.  This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly.

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours.

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.)

773,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR 4C HAIR,"At first I thought this would be another hair fail. I have 4C hair, and there are so many products that promise to be compatible that aren't, all they do is dry you hair out, and sit on top of it making it gritty and harder to manage. I have low porosity hair, and most products just don't work for me. I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."
774,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for 4c hair!,I purchased this product along with the curl enhancing moisture cream for my daughter who has 4c hair. It did not work for her hair at all see pics(last two) however for my hair it did great! I have 4a/4b hair. It defined my curls perfectly! The moisture was disappointing especially since this product is supposed to be for very dry hair; It was just ok. Overall I will not be purchasing it again for my daughter but MAY buy it for myself. If you have 4c hair save your money!
775,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I get so many compliments on my hair,"So far I am please with this conditioner and the shampoo.  I have tried so many different products since I've gone natural about 8 yrs ago. I do not have natural curls,  therefore I need to moisturized my hair to bring the curls out. I've consistently been using this and I'm please. I use a different brand after shampoo and conditioner called leave in or rinse out conditioner by Shea Martin."

826,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy with this product,This butter leaves my hair stiff and it leaves a residue in my hair which makes my hair look dirty as if I have uncontrollable dandruff.
827,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dry after effect on hair,It has a good slip and gave good curl definition .

I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Sulfate Free Shampoo for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Sulfate Free Shampoo for Curly Hair, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

This and the Monoi Carol’s Daughter masks are really good. Don’t get the almond one though. It’s thick, and it makes your hair silky!

0,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I great product!,I haven't open this order yet because I have some left over from what I been using already. I love Carol Daughter Conditioner and Shampoo. I had a problem with my hair matted up after Shampooing.  No matter what I used. I mean litterally matted up that my daughter had to help get it unmatted. I don't no why whether age or medication changed the texture of my hair. I had a hard time untangling it. I saw the advertisements on the HSN about the Carol Daughter. It said your hair will not be tangled so I decided to try it. I was like wow. I had no more problems with my hair. No tangles or anything.  It combs with ease. The only thing what I paid this time I feel was kind of steep.  When I first bought it which was off HSN I got 2 large bottles of the shampoo and conditioner together for a low price. I wish I would have went back and bought more when the price was a lot better
1,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally!!!!,"I have natural hair and scarring alopecia and have suffered from dry hair, scalp inflammation, balding, and breakage since 2006. I've tried so many different kinds of conditioners, including Jane Carter Solutions, Design Essentials, Meille Organics, Hairfinity, Miss Jessie, Naturall, Shea Moisture, and 3 Minute Miracle Moist. Some of these conditioners were ok, and some were better, but none completely wowed me until now. Oh my goodness, after using this conditioner, my hair had so much slip. It was detangled. And, there was so much moisture even with the driest parts of my hair. I was amazed by this Monoi Repairing conditioner. It took 14 years before I finally found a conditioner that would moisturize, detangle, and strengthen my hair. Thank you, Carol's Daughter!"
2,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,TOO SMELLY TOO EXPENSIVE for toxic products,"Opened it for the first time and wow the scent is wonderful....until it never. Went. Away!! TWO DAYS later, the scent is still so strong! It’s giving me a headache, I’m embarrassed to go out shopping because people act like I poured perfume all over my body, my husband is annoyed... it’s really bad. Look at the ingredients lists. The conditioner has PERFUME (aka toxic fragrance) as the 4th or 5th ingredient. This is not a safer or less toxic product but I thought if it worked I would look past that. Nope, definitely not worth it!Also, my hair does NOT break less and using both the shampoo and conditioner makes the ends of my hair staticky and the roots get oily. Not impressed and extremely disappointed considering how very VERY expensive this is!"
3,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It says it helps with breakage after one use! Hair is falling out like crazy!,"I’ve been using this product for a month now. I always wait to write reviews. I hate reading reviews where people are already giving it 5 stars because they received it fast or the packaging is cute. I like real reviews. So the bottle says 92% less breakage after one use. That’s the whole reason I bought this. After a month, my hair is still falling out like crazy, maybe even more then usual honestly. Only good thing I can Say is my hair is shiny. But def. lot of hair fallout. Will not be purchasing again."

Once it was dry hair was soft. The conditioner also requires a lot to apply to hair.The price for this conditioner is not worth it. This conditioner can be used with other carol daughter products. The ingredients in this conditioner are similar to Sacred Tiare, which is no longer sold."
5,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too pricey,"Decent, but the price for the amount you get is not worth it in my opinion.  I have thin but long 3a curly hair and i went through this in a couple weeks and it worked only slightly better than other cheaper stuff i have used.  Maybe would be ok to use only a couple times a week to extend life but then may not have the same results.Scent is nice but nauseatingly strong on wet hair, luckily smell dulls down once it dries."

After about a day or two of use, I immediately noticed a difference in my hair.  Reduced itching, increased thickness, and a reduction in dandruff are huge starts in the right direction.  You don't need to use much for a good lather, either, with an 8.5oz bottle lasting a few months at least.  I've been very happy, and will continue using this product along with its shampoo counterpart."

It doesn't weigh your hair down like most deep conditioners, but leaves it soft and bouncy. I have very thick wavy hair that is dry from blow dryer and color treatment. I use it with other brands of shampoo. Try the conditioner and I don't think you will be disappointed."

Moisturizing and detangles hair. I used the shampoo and conditioner. But the plastic bottle they use? It's hard and you can't squeeze product out..you have to shake it like a ketchup bottle..it takes time for product to come out

Overall, it works and it smells great."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible..bottle~,The conditioner is GREAT but you try to turn that bottle top with wet and slippery hands.  Worse the stuff costs more money then most and I don't mind paying it because I like it but so much gets stuck in the bottle you can't get out.  You try water and turning it upside down and still some is left.  :(

27,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,a product I have been loyal to has changed,"I've been using this product for years and I have loved it. However, my previous order has a different smell. I wondered if maybe the supplier had given me a fake product but I asked my mother who buys the same product from ULTA and she said hers smelled different too thus my assumption is that Carol's Daughter has changed the product. It doesn't smell bad.... but it doesn't smell luscious like it used to. The top of the bottle is also much harder to work with. I think they made the plastic parts inside the top flimsier. It still works the same as well, which is great because it tames my curly hair with out weighing it down. But I'm just so disappointed in the change of smell and how they tried to act as if it were the same product. If the smell has changed let me know ahead of time."

31,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner,I have used this product before and I like it I would have given my top 4 star  however The top was not cooperating with the usual way you retrieve the conditioner it is suppose to come out the small hole at the top by pulling up on the top. without completely removing the top.  I have to unscrew and remove the whole top in order to get to the product which is not good because you have to use more then you intend to.  a 5 star at this time is not realistic because the jury is still out .  Other than that It is a good product
32,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works,"I use the entire system of products and my hair is in great condition. I have fine long blonde hair and I color or do the roots about every 3 mos. I was having a huge slow down in growth, as well, I was shedding big time. If my fine hair had a snag or tangle, forget it - a chunk of like 20 strands would come out. Haven't seen that since using monoi! Also, there is literally no hair on my comb after using now. I have been using this for 4 months. It's an easy to use system. Also, I discovered it from my mother in law who uses it, and she is black with straightened/permed hair so I'm pretty sure this works well for everyone, as the two of us have completely different hair types but we both love the CD Monoi products!"

After using the samples I fell in love with these products.  When used together they made my hair feel better than ever before.

This works where many, many very pricey designer brands have not.  I am caucasian with thinning kinky, dry hair.  This conditioner really edges out the dryness without dulling or weighing it down.  Also good for managing fly-aways on dry hair.I am picky about products, give this one a B+ and will definitely continue to use it.  The packaging however, rates a D-.  There is just no excuse for the poor packaging.  The dispensing lids don't work well and the product is difficult to get out the container.  A first year student studying Packaging Science at RIT could do a better job of designing a user friendly dispensing system than the manufactures have done here.  The effectiveness of the conditioner makes it worth suffering through the packaging mechanics until they come up with a better system."

Did anyone in this company try use open it with wet hands? Its such a pain. I also have their cleansing conditioner, which uses a pump/spout, and its also infuriating to use with wet hands. Whats wrong with the normal style shampoo/conditioner tops? Dear Carol's Daughter, please test your product packaging in real-world conditions, like, with wet hands in the shower..."

82,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not a fan,"I really wanted to like this conditioner, but it was horrible. I have fine thin naturally curly hair which has a lot of breakage. I've read a lot about minoi oil and was eager to try this to hopefully fix my hair issues. My hair was a big poof ball every day I used this. My curls were no longer defined, they were big and unruly. I stuck with it for about a month and finally gave up after being completely embarrassed with my hair. I decided to straight to the source and buy some minoi oil. My hair now feels fantastic!"

92,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lives up to promises,"I purchased the Monoi Repairing conditioner and shampoo and have used them together about five times now. I have long, thick hair which I wear in a severe bun for work on a daily basis. I'm very concerned about damaging or breaking my hair for this reason and consistently seek out shampoo/conditioner sets that promise anti-breakage or restorative effects. These products are easily some of the best I've used. Both the shampoo and conditioner are incredibly thick and feel very rich. They smell great, and my hair both feels very smooth and strong and looks great- even after taking my hair down from a braided bun the day after washing, I can't see any split ends. I usually don't use any shampoos that are supposed to be ""hydrating"" because my hair can get oily, but these products haven't weighed my hair down at all. I'm thrilled with the results I've seen so far."
93,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for your money!,This product is very good and it helps my hair grow and have less breakage. Love this product!
94,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Hopes dashed..,"As with the shampoo, I was not impressed with this product. Lots of rave reviews claiming it helped with problems that I wanted to fix in my own hair made me think I had found a shampoo and conditioner I could stick with. WRONG. The shampoo was more disappointing than the conditioner, so my overall displeasure might be more the shampoo's fault than the conditioner's, but it wasn't without blame. I had to squeeze the s**t out of it to get enough to cover just the ends from nape to tip. My hair does reach my lower back, but I don't recall having to squeeze that much on any other conditioners. It's just too thick for the dinky hole in the bottle. (Same size as the shampoo hole.) It didn't leave my hair shiny, didn't help with breakage or fallout, and certainly didn't make it smoother and less tangled. In fact, after using both products, I felt that my hair had less luster than before I started using the duo. I have ordered a different duo from another brand which arrived today and I will be passing off the remnants of this one to the bf."

This does a decent job detangling my hair and leaves it looking fairly moisturized and frizz free. And that's no small feat because my hair is pretty fried. I really like the smell. The price is a bit of a deterrent, but if I can't find any better options I will stick with it."
108,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best product ever,"Best product ever, it does everything that it says it would do and more. I've been using this product now for about 6 weeks now and I have seen a tremendous difference in the texture of my hair being a black American with kinky hair. It actually has grew my hair, and it holds my colored hair longer than most other products which would have stripped all the coloring from my hair after the first usage. I read a lot of the reviews from other customers complaining about the price. That was my concern too at first but after trying it and seeing the results,  I don't  complain anymore, and you should take into consideration of the very smart way they designed the bottle tops. To let know that you only need a little. And who puts inexpensive contents and  non working,  no-good products in a glass bottle. I was a little skeptical with the name of it, I mean it didn't sound like a normal for a product, but I'm glad I didn't let that defer from trying it, keep up the good works. I will be buying more and referring it to my daughters and others."

Used Monoi Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner for approx. 2 months starting in Dec. 2013.  Once the Repairing shampoo had done its job, continued to use the Monoi Repairing Conditioner along with the Hair Milk co-wash.  The conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth and manageable.  I also use the Hair Milk leave in conditioner ( it can be used daily) and have achieved results I only used to get from my stylist.  I would recommend this product to those who are looking for soft manageable hair without be weighted down or greasy or slick feeling.  It is simply the best hair care line I have found to date."

161,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,I wouldn't purchase this again.,I have oily hair and this shampoo did not strip my hair clean as some can. It also didn't feel as if my hair were fully clean. It weighed my hair down within 24 hours after use. I also use it in combination with the Monoi Repairing Conditioner and occasionally a thermal protectant product (which I have used for more than one year) when I use the flat iron. It does make my hair manageable for combing after washing and has a decent scent. It does not add much shine to my hair. I am in my 40's and color my hair every 2-3 months. I used this product at the end of summer and through to fall. It may have added some elasticity to my hair but it is difficult to tell at this point. Perhaps with additional use one could determine for certain. I will not be making a repeat purchase of this product. It may work better for someone with normal or dry hair.

166,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This conditioner smells great and moisturizes well. I wash & condition my somewhat dry hair once or twice once a week, and this conditioner makes it soft and handles frizz without making my hair greasy. It looks shiny and healthy, even though I'm long overdue for a cut. I can't speak to whether it actually makes my hair stronger, and normal hair loss (just normal human shedding, nothing remarkable) seems unchanged.It's relatively thick and creamy, and it goes farther than cheaper drugstore stuff--you get the coverage you expect from a nicer conditioner. 1-2 tablespoons fully saturates my long (bra strap-length), layered hair.The packaging, I don't like. The lid makes me crazy--you turn the lid a bit and it opens a hole in the lid--it looks like the old Vidal Sassoon lid, but with the action like a glue or yellow mustard bottle. For some reason, I have trouble with it every time. Finally, I just decided to leave it open all the time, which is fine for now (except that I worry about it getting knocked over, and it's on the spendy side vs. my default drugstore cheapness), but when it gets to the end of the bottle and I have to invert it, the battle with the lid will start over. Either that, or I have to waste the end of the bottle, which I resent generally, but particularly with nicer stuff (both because it's a treat and expensive)."

The natural ingredients in it are very beneficial to that end.  The overall ingredient list is anything but ""all natural"" so if you are looking for an all natural solution, this is not it.Ingredients:Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Glycerin, Isododecane, Fragrance (Parfum), Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Isohexadecane, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia Tahitensis Flower Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Oil, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Juice, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Hibiscus Esculentus Extract, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Panthenol (Pro-vitamin B5), Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Cinnamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Octyldodecanol, Ceteareth-20, Quaternium-91, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sorbic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, and Methylisothiazolinone.The middle of the ingredient list is actually very beneficial and tends to ""repair"" hair damage such as split ends and dryness, without making hair greasy or oily looking or feeling.  You do not need to use a lot so go light at first until you determine the right amount to work into your hair.The scent i slight but pleasant. I would suggest this product for anyone looking for a good quality conditioner for dry or split hair."
168,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a fan of Carol's Daughter's products for several years now after getting some samples in from Sephora. My hair is fine, thinning (due to medical issues and medication), and will not hold a curl even if you were to spray it with superglue. To top it off, I get the frizzies like nobody's business. I've tried and returned or given away so many different brands and products over the years it's ridiculous.  Cue Carol's Daughter and their Monoi Repairing Conditioner. I LOVE this repairing conditioner. It makes my hair feel incredible - thick, full, soft, not weighed down at all, and the scent is soooo good. A lot of repairing conditioners or masks leave too much residue on my hair in order to keep the cuticle down and make the hair feel better. This weighs my hair down and leaves it feeling waxy or greasy. I don't want something that is going to make my hair look or feel like it hasn't been washed in three weeks. Yuck.A great way to use this Monoi Repairing Conditioner is to thoroughly slather this on your hair, put on a shower cap to keep all your hair up and covered, wrap one of those twisty turbans around your head to keep the heat in (or an old t-shirt), and go about your day. After several hours, usually before bed, take a shower and rinse the conditioner out of your hair. I do this every few weeks, and it has helped my hair so much. Even after having it bleached and dyed, my hair is still in amazing shape. No dryness, split ends, frizzies, or any other annoying hair troubles."
169,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this conditioner along with the matched shampoo from Carol’s Daughter, and the combination is just right for my hair.  I have very soft, fine hair that is also very curly.  It needs a conditioner/detangler after shampooing, but it’s hard for me to find one that doesn’t weigh my hair down too much.  This combination strikes the right balance, leaving my hair clean, soft, and bouncy.I like the twist-cap bottle design with no cap or spout to break off or clog, but the label is very hard to read.  I try to set the bottles in the same order every time to help me determine which is shampoo and which is conditioner, as they look very similar and it’s almost impossible to squint out the print on the label.I’ve found I need only a small dab of shampoo and conditioner so, like many higher quality products, this one seems expensive only until you try it and realize how long it lasts.  I’ve heard many good things about the Carol’s Daughter line of products, but this has been my first chance to try them for myself.  I expect these to be my go-to shampoo and conditioner from now on."

From the first time I used my new conditioner I noticed that my hair had lost its bushy, somewhat straw-like quality, for the most part.  My wavy, short-ish hair now feels smooth and silkier.Several reviewers have mentioned the fragrance.  Generally, I like little or no fragrance in products, and this one has a fairly strong herbal (I think) fragrance in the bottle.  However, I don't notice any fragrance after I rinse the conditioner off my hair, and I haven't noticed any fragrance lingering on my pillowcase.  The dispensing bottle gave me fits the first time I tried to open it in the shower, but it only takes a slight twist to open the top to the dispensing position, so the problem quickly solved itself.Final verdict:  Very nice product.  I'm going to buy the shampoo also, after I finish up the last of my present shampoo (which is also used on horses)."

I like this heavy repairing conditioner. I have one conditioner that I use religiously because it makes a huge difference in my hair compared to other conditioners. I like to try products though because you never know, one may really work.This product really works. It makes my hair feel really good and it adds thickness, body and shine. I can use it without my hair being flat or lifeless. This is a good conditioner. The only downsides are the cap on the bottle but it does prevent too much product from gushing out which is also kind of a good thing, and the smell. The smell isn't what I would call great. It's very different. It's not bad per se, but it's not wonderfully refreshing either. It's kind of like....what? But as for the performance of the product on my hair-it's fabulous and it makes me eager to try some other products of this brand.I don't know where aside from Amazon it is available because I have never heard of it. I do really like it and a little product goes a long way which is another plus. All in all, great conditioning effect just an odd smell, but it doesn't really stay on my hair."

It has worked well for my hair. I have medium length, fine curly hair. It can get incredibly frizzy if not given the right care. This conditioner goes on nice and thick, and conditions my hair wonderfully. It also rinses out without a fight. My hair feels healthier, in general, since using this conditioner.My only complaint is the bottle. Once I got to about halfway through the bottle, the lid explodes off  the bottle. I've tried putting it back on in every way possible. I've made sure the top was open, so the extra air could escape, but it still pops off. It's never enough to harm anyone(I don't think), but the lid will fly up into the air, with a little popping sound. At this point, I just set the top onto the bottle without fastening it on. I fear it will get dumped out like this, though. I don't know if this is a common issue, making it a design flaw, or if I just got a stubborn bottle.Other than the lid issue, I think this conditioner is wonderful!"

It doesn’t have the same slippery feel that most conditioners give off when your hair is wet, and that had me a little worried at first.  It wasn’t until I blew dry my hair that I noticed how nice my hair felt.  I usually apply a mousse before drying to help with control, but since using this monoi conditioner, I no longer need to.I like it so much that I’m going to get the matching monoi repairing shampoo.  Its scent is very strong, and that might be a turn-off to some.  I love the fragrance and after my hair is dry, the scent isn’t noticeable.

Wet hands aren't a plus when trying to open a container.  I guess I could get used to it though.I don't know why this was not my favorite item by Carol's Daughter....it might be that darn top.  But I think this was made for oilier hair and/or much curlier hair than mine.  It seemed like it took the shine out of my hair as when my hair was dry, it was very dull.  Now, I think I should put here that I am a senior citizen and I have thinning, fine grey hair.  This just didn't seem my kind of conditioner.  I live in a retirement community and a lady that lives down the hall is African American and her daughter is an actress on Broadway.  She told me both she and her daughter love all of her products.  So, maybe it's just me."

I'm pretty happy with it.My hair is dry and somewhat damaged from color treatment.  I find this product very easy to work through my hair; it rinses out cleanly without leaving residue.  It smells very similar to the shampoo, and the smell lingers for awhile, so it's best to find out if you like this before using it!  (Try smelling it in a store before ordering.)My hair is shiny and soft when I use this.  I still get a bit of frizz, but I do think at least some of my frizz is tamed by using this conditioner.This seems to be safe for color-treated hair; I haven't seen any fading even though I shampoo and condition every day.  I think this also helps a little with detangling, which is nice, since my hair is quite long and gets tangled easily.  Definitely glad I got a chance to try this one!"

I have fine, fly away hair and I have to be careful about using conditioners that weigh it down and make it look flat. This doesn’t do that. And it has the nicest scent! The fragrance is floral and smells like jasmine. It doesn’t leave behind a lot of scent after my hair is dried, and that’s a good thing. I would probably grow tired of it if I had to smell it all day.The only thing I don’t like about this product is the packaging. The top twists to open a small hole in the top where conditioner is released. But it’s somewhat difficult to turn it all the way to open or close it, especially with wet hands in the shower. I would prefer a flip top like other conditioners. This one is just an annoyance."
177,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Bamboo Water and Pro Vitamin B5 for Strength and Less Breakage, 8.5 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,5 stars is not nearly enough....,"note: since I use the shampoo and the conditioner together this review covers both as a ""team"" and I've left basically the same review for the shampoo.I don't give out five stars unless a product is pretty flawless; it has to meet or exceed its product claims, be fairly priced for what it claims to do, and have no obvious tweaks needed to make it better. This trifecta of excellence is rarer than you think but with this conditioner and its sister shampoo my hair has finally met its perfect match ....My hair: I am 42 years old, biracial with very curly, slightly kinky hair. It is fine textured, light to medium density, and breaks VERY, VERY easily. My hair is not chemically processed so I occasionally use a flat iron or curling iron for styling. Mostly I wear a medium length afro style these days with Jane Carter Solution Wrap and Roll, 8.5 Ounce as a styling aid to define the curls. Over the years I have used exclusive salon products like Ouidad, drug store brands, high end department store like Fekkai, earthy brands like Ojon, and just about everything in between. The results always left me searching for something that would help my hair feel and look healthy and strong. With all the trial and error I never found any one or two products that worked well enough to satisfy my needs. I can't comment as to how the conditioner works alone since I have used the shampoo as well from day one, but as far as my experience using both products I'd say that Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner produced results better than anything else I've ever tried.After the first shampoo and conditioner treatment I proceeded to comb through my hair while it was still wet, a task that usually involves a considerable amount of pulling and results in the inevitable huge hair ball that winds up tangled on the comb. With the Carol's Daughter Monoi products the amount of hairs on the comb was only about a quarter of what was usually shed with my former shampoo and conditioner. Suffice to say I was floored.....""92% reduction in breakage"" printed right there on the label is a pretty big claim to make and I was *very* skeptical of such a bold statement. I would have had no qualms about requesting refund if this product fell short of my expectations but this shampoo along with the conditioner delivers on its claims. With the first use I had about 75% less breakage than with my former products and the results have remained steady over six months of use. I waited to post this review because I wanted to see if I would need to switch products either due to the seasons changing or to see if buildup would happen or if the results would taper off; I've seen consistently EXCELLENT results over the months and for the first time ever as far as shampoos and conditioners goes I feel I have FINALLY found ""the one""!The scent of both the shampoo and conditioner is fabulous; leaves a light scent on the hair.Does not leave weight or residue on my hair with either the shampoo or conditioner which is VERY important since my hair is fine.For what seems like forever my hair was constantly the same length due to breakage but in the months since switching to Carol's Daughter I've gained over an inch of length.My hair is soft and manageable.Expensive* but worth it and that's something I say very RARELY.*Edit 01/12: recently I've seen the price jump here to almost double what I've paid; if listed here for more than eighteen dollars you'll likely be able to ""search"" this for less.Easily, happily and 100% recommended!"

My hair is prone to getting split ends and breakage. I had been using ion keratin treatment conditioner and saw some improvement with that, but I wanted to give this a try. The bottle is really pretty and would be good for traveling. The conditioner itself felt a little oily to me. It made my hair soft and there was no oily feeling once it was all rinsed out, but I did start getting split ends again after several uses and noticed my hair breaking again.

Until I started using this conditioner, I always had a wad of hair to clean out of my comb.From the first time I used this conditioner, there is virtually no hair in my comb when combed through it immediately after washing.There are still a lot of tangles to work through when my hair is wet however.In the evening when I comb through my hair, again, very few hairs to dispose of.How this works is a mystery to me, but my hair is softer and fuller after just a few uses."

Although I have just started using the Monoi leave-in repairing spray made by Carol's which I am loving at the moment.The lid on the conditioner broke but I really didn't like the lid anyway.  It's a twist lid that lowers up and down which reveals a hole to dispense the product.  Easy enough just to remove the lid and pour it into my hand but they really need to change the design.

Yes it is loaded with natural stuff and no chemicals.  Yes a little goes a long way.  But it loses a star for the smell. It smells like a urinal cake. I hate to say it, but it does. It reminds me of very strongly of the smell in every stadium, airport, and public restroom I have ever been. It is not awful, but not the best scent in the world."

Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo 8.5 FL OZ

  . This is the dynamic duo for my fine, thin, normal hair that needs volume and as much help as is possible with shedding and breaking. I got some fragile locks and this stuff has been the cat's meow on them!This is the best smelling conditioner I have ever used. There are a few that come close but none that can top it. It moisturizes very well without leaving my hair limp, lank, and lifeless. The curse of fine thin hair that's not uber dry is that many/most conditioners just weigh you down -- and by mid day your hair is a bunch of bah humbug'ness that makes you want to skip out on any form of mirror or reflection.You don't need a ton, it does distribute well in my hair, and it provides a medium amount of slip. I prefer ""grabby"" conditioners that don't make my hair feel like I waxed it up like a surf board. It's enough slip to comb through easily - and that's what I like.My hair feels soft, has volume, and (MOST importantly) I have found this combo (shampoo and conditioner) to really decrease the breakage and shedding I have. My hair is stronger and easier to manage.I do need to point out that I would not recommend this conditioner to someone with coarse very thick hair that requires a lot of slip in order to get out tangles and such. While I think this *could* work for that type I would be a bit scared at how much product you'd need. The cost of this stuff per month could be like an Iphone. My daughter has very very thick mixed hair that requires about 1/2 c. of conditioner just to be able to comb through. This is an 8.5 oz bottle -- you can do the math!For fine haired gals/guys this is a superb find. Curly or straight it works awesome. I do rotate it with

It didn’t really linger in my hair after I rinsed it out, which was really nice.  The conditioner isn’t so thick or greasy that it weighs the hair down, either.  It washes out very easily, but manages to leave enough moisture behind to make a difference in the hair’s texture.When I was combing my hair after the shower, I was pleased by how soft and silky my hair felt.  As it air-dried, I was pleased to see that my hair wasn’t frizzing nearly as much as usual.I’ve already added the conditioner and its matching shampoo to my shopping cart, to be purchased when my current supply runs out.

I also have always thought this brand to be aimed more to African American women. But the sales lady at Sephora convinced me anyone with damaged hair would benefit from it.The Shampoo and Conditioner are pretty much the best hair products I have found in so many years.  I am from a mixed background (indigenous Indian/Caribbean/Spanish) so my hair is naturally frizzy curls, that the curls eventually fade and my hair is one giant puff ball and with years of the hot iron its now dry and brittle.  I saw a change instantly on the first try. I've been using it for a month now, and I see my hair has transformed. No more clumps of hair in the drain, I can run my hand through my hair and come up with no hair on the floor. Less breakage for sure and all around healthy shiny look. I am so happy with my hair now. Even when I don't use heat to straighten my hair, my curls are soft and bouncey, and need a little leave in conditioner to keep the style all day. I have People definitely noticed the change. I will keep buying until my hair resists its awesomeness. My only gripe is the selling price on here for $33! There's no way I am paying for that. Sephora.com has the conditioner for $20 and the shampoo for $18.  I have seen a crazy inflation all across amazon.com for this product.  The only reasonably priced item in this line is the hair mask, which runs at $29 on Sephora.com. But if you add the shipping, its about the same. If you have unmanageable frizzy dry unhappy hair, give this a shot. Just not from here :P"

When I ran out I decided to buy just the conditioner because its SO hard to find a conditioner that works for my hair (but I would get all of them if they cost a little less.)I have very fine straight hair. Last summer I thought my hair was boring so I decided to get a perm to make it wavy and super model-like. Well, the perm didn't exactly turn out that way and I regret the day I ever thought about doing it. Now my hair is super dry from the perm and from my everyday use o flat iron.This product leaves my hair silky without wearing it down. Plus, as others have mentioned, it smells soooo good, kind of like coconuts. Will definitely keep buying."

This is the best shampoo I have ever tried—I really feel clean after my showers now and I do not see any build up, no matter how much I exercise or products I use. It is definitely water based, but you can tell the difference between this shampoo and the water. It actually feels soothing. It turns into foam immediately without you barely having to touch it, and it’s fun, too! Don’t get me started on the fragrance 😍 the highlight of my days is using this shampoo! Not to mention how it looks much shiner and my hair got its life back after 3 years of miserable greasiness and product buildup! Yes, I have tried every brand you can think of—Organic to drugstore to salon, but none ever worked as beautifully as this shampoo. I can go longer without shampooing now and just head for the conditioner instead. This is A. M.  A. Z.  I. N. G! I am definitely a forever customer now.EDIT: I completely forgot that it’s 2020, and everything requires a pic or no proof :p so I’ve attached a picture of myself on the 2nd day (I normally will have to put it up in a bun at this point). 3 weeks later, still so hyped about this shampoo!"

Otherwise I didn't like it at all. It made my hair very dry and hard, it felt like all my moisture was stripped from my hair. I had to use a Shea Moisture conditioning treatment to add the moisture and softness back to my hair. I won't purchase this product again, but I will keep the bottle to add other shampoo in it."

I hope it stays around forever because no other clarifying shampoos match it for me! It follows the curly girl method and it really takes care of build up. I was always asking my stylists how to clear my dandruff that I had for years, they would tell me that I didn’t have dandruff (and for some reason not explain build up). Finally I realized that the flakes I kept seeing might have been build up, so I looked into taking care of it. A head scrubber alone wasn’t working and neither were the clarifying shampoos. Just ONE use of this product and all of the flakes were gone. Some people complain about the liquid form, but that’s the best part for me because it can flow down my scalp and reach every section before I scrub to make it foam. The pointed nozzle makes it easy to control as well. Plus it smells amazing!! I would advise using a good conditioner afterwards, of course."

This however also made my hair feel very brittle and hard after using. I would of course follow up with conditioner+deep conditioner but I didn't like how it made my hair feel. It tangled my hair even though i started on detangled hair which was kind of weird for me. I usually use Tresemme Deep Cleanse but wanted to try something 'natural' and 'curly girl' approved. I wasted ten bucks. I used it once then used it to clean my oil applicator bottles then i gave it away. It's stripping to the point of making my hair feel like straw. Didn't like it. The scent is okay, kind of smells like Jasmine."

I have waist length locs.  I tried this and I was pleasantly surprised. I liked the tip where I was able to apply the product on my scalp.  It took a few minutes to foam but keep in mind my hair was dirty.  I wouldn't use this alone, I followed up with a moisturizing and deep cleaning shampoo.  I used mainly on my scalp and not the rest of my hair.  My scalp didn't feel dry.  I will continue to use as a pre-poo.  Please note this has a scent.  The smell didn't bother me but if you're sensitive to smells I would pass on this product."

I'm not even exaggerating.  It feels sooooo good on my scalp!  I think that's the best part in my opinion.  I love the fact that it doesn't take much.  I just put a few drops in certain spots on my head and it lathered completely and fully.  You can really feel the cleanliness.  It is true that it's not stripping away, and it's doing exactly what it says.  When I started my natural hair journey, 10 years ago, I started using Carol's Daughter products.

I have natural hair, about 3c texture and I have never had my hair tangle in my life. This shampoo made my hair tangle and knot up sooooooooo bad. I have never experienced anything like this in my entire life. I wash my hair in sections, I did nothing different with this shampoo on my wash day but it tangled up my hair so bad I will never use it again. I thought I was going to have to cut my hair. My curls are very loose but this shampoo had me wondering if it killed my curls. Took me 2 weeks to get my curls back to normal. They were frizzy and dead after this.

The shampoo is thin & watery; it looks like diluted shampoo.  It smells like a combo of citrus & herbal.  The shampoo lathers up easily but your hair has to be soaking wet which for me takes a couple of minutes under the water.I used the shampoo twice as is, & it made my hair feel dry, stripped & coarse.  I added grapeseed oil, then  argan oil, which made the shampoo feel better in my hands but still left my hair very dry.  After 6 shampoos I've discontinued use, & chalked it up as a learning experience: I won't try this brand again."

I also want to say the scent is amazing. It smells like a fresh herb garden or something I love it. What I do not love, it that my hair feels seriously dry after I wash. I wash once every 5 days and that includes conditioning. I have very thick hair and it is moderately wavy, and I have not had dryness before. I do not think this agrees with me or something which sucks because this stuff smells amazing. I will be gifting to my husband"

But cowashing doesn't do enough to help my scalp, and I can tell it has buildup because it feels itchy.  With that said, this product was a total game changer. I love that I can target my scalp without needing to wash my ends, and it leaves my hair feeling both clean AND surprisingly softer than before! I still can tell that I used a more ""stripping"" product, but it is way way way less drying than any shampoo or rinse I've tried before. Importantly, it does a really good job of cleansing my scalp - I can see all the buildup wash down the drain and I don't get that effect nearly as much with cowashing."

I've been searching for a replacement for DevaCurl's Micellar Cleanser. This isn't it. The only thing I like about it is the scent, which is fresh and subtle. Everything else, however, is a total bust. It's SO watery that it's impossible to control the amount used during application. After rinsing it out, my hair didn't exactly feel stripped, but it didn't feel silky like it does with similar products. After my hair dried, it turned into a frizzy, static-y mess. I'm on the second day after washing and my hair looks like a mess. I won't be using this again."

I will keep it in hopes that once I get my hair in a better healthy state that I might be able to use it again but for now it's going to sit and collect dust.

I prefer sulfate-free shampoos because sulfates irritate & dry my scalp, but a lot of them don’t have much lather, have difficulty penetrating my hair, and don’t remove enough oil. This formula completely fixes all those issues! The watery consistency and pointed applicator goes right to the scalp, and gives a nice fresh feeling without being drying. I was struggling with some flakiness that was almost completely eliminated in one wash, and my hair stayed cleaner for longer (Oily by day 3 instead of day 2). It has a fresh, pleasant scent too."

If you're like me and are suffering from protein overload I highly recommend this clarifying cleanser.I watched a ton of videos, read tons of articles, Reddit posts on protein overload and they kept saying the same thing; YOU HAVE TO CLARIFY. Well the shampoo I had wasn't cutting it so I decided to give this one a go. At first it made a difference, but not enough to get my hair back to normal. I washed my hair with this every other day, but when that wasn't working, I decided to wash and rinse my hair TWICE in one shower and then do a thick moisturizing mask and that was when I saw the difference in my hair! This stuff did a great job of stripping it all off and my hair is curly and bouncy again :')Definitely recommend you wash twice a few times with a thick protein free moisturizing mask.

This shampoo cleans my scalp and hair to ""start all over"".  It's strong and intense cleaning, so I wouldn't use it all the time.  I wish it wasn't quite so liquidy, because it is easy to waste a lot.  But, it does the trick, so I am happy with my purchase.  I like another drugstore stocked name brand micellar water clarifying shampoo too that is a thicker--so no waste, but have been unable to find it.  So, this is a perfectly acceptable back-up."

Of course adding water is ideal, but not entirely necessary. Can be used standing up or even sitting in a chair! It’s not messy or runny at all and doesn’t drip. My daughter uses it as she’s learning to wash her own hair in the shower so it’s great for kids learning independence to use on their own. It’s way different and less messy than traditional shampoo. It does seem to have clarifying properties, so it’s not as moisturizing, but after using the Wash Day Delight conditioner which is a gel, my hair was moisturized with good slip. A very good leave in conditioner was needed afterward to maintain maximum moisture and I seal with oil. I love this set and I love the smell! Makes a great addition to your child’s personal care items because they aren’t creamy and drippy so the chances of shampoo and conditioner getting in their eyes is no worry at all.

However it doesnt induce migraines or cause itching for me as many fragrances usually do.  It also doesnt permeate and overtake your hair or entire bathroom as most others that contain so many hazardous chemicals.  This smell washes right out and leaves a very light pleasant scent that only someone close could smell.Also my hair and scalp health has improved since using this shampoo and conditioner.  It really is a delight and I use it about every three days.  It is different than anything I have ever used and I love it.

This ain’t It.,"This smelled amazing and did what the title says....... it foamed easily when applied to my wet hair/scalp. This shampoo however, did NOT make my hair feel clean. I shampooed about 6x. I’m a curl girl (3c/4a and shoulder/upper back length hair). This did not remove the oils on my scalp(Castor, Coconut etc). BUT, it definitely softened my hair. If that’s all you need, great. But Carol and her Daughter def let me down with this product. No, I will not buy this again, ever. And I wish I could send back the open and used bottle."

I recently started the processes of bringing my curls back from extreme heat damage and been trying new moisturizing products. Only thing about these products is that they are so hard to remove from hair that is why I decided to try this shampoo and as of now it worked wonders! The bottle is not that big but u only use very little and starts foaming so easily even before I start lathering it. I will do an updated review in a few weeks."
26,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really cleansed my hair from all of the product I use,"I found that this product really did a great job of actually cleaning all of the product out of my hair. I have very thick, naturally curly hair so I tend to use a lot of styling products to tame it. This product made my hair feel so clean and soft."
27,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Do NOT use this every week if you have moisture retention problems,"It gets your hair so clean and the scent is amazing. I'm honestly waiting for wash day delight to come out with a leave in so my hair can smell like this all the time. It is a bit too drying for people that shampoo every week, which is not a problem for me since i only do that once a month. It gets your hair a bit TOO clean tho so i use it sparingly with my shampoo brush. It has adequate slip if you detangle with shampoo and can do it fast enough(do leave shampoo sitting in your hair for a long time please). You definitely have to deep condition after using this shampoo or your hair may get brittle over repeated uses. When i run out i probably will just use the bottle as an applicator bottle  because of the nozzle."

This leaves my locs with some sheen to it bc it is clear and doesn't deposit any residue on the locs. I also love the fragrance. I'm sensitive to smell and this one didn't bother me. I absolutely could not stand the rise water one. I gave it to mys sister and she likes it just as much as this one.

My scalp is oily and ends get dry. This product messes with curl pattern every time I use it. Its like my hair hates it. I am Hispanic with medium thick curly/wavy hair. Maybe this is good for other hair types but not mine.

I have dandruff and an itchy scalp and this stuff actually reduces it! It's not even labeled as a dandruff product, but it really does help! I think it's the aloe. It also smells amazing. It takes a while to lather up. I use a scalp brush so that definitely helps. It probably takes more product and time if you're using just your fingers. Anyways, just go for it!"

32,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer!,Reading the reviews I was not sure this would work but I was so wrong. I swim daily and teach swimming 3 days a week so my hair is very dry even in a cap.  I have 2C curls but if I lived in more humid climate would be much curlier.  This product removed chlorine film and my scalp has never felt better.  This is my new 1x a week treatment and would recommend to anyone.  My curls bounced up higher and my crown even has waves and body.  I didn’t need to use as much product as I would normally.  I have been a fan of the other products in this line for years but this just upped the game.

I have locs and it really gets out the surface dirt build-up. Love the smell and the lather. The only down side it cleans so well you must use a moisturizer to rehydrate your hair.

For years my hair has been getting matted so easily and tangled. I’ve been using this for only 3 weeks and I have hardly had to brush my hair. The knots fall right out and my hair stays sooooo clean and soft for days. I will never use another shampoo and conditioner again.....wow

37,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It's a no for me!!!,I actually like the concept of this shampoo it was easier to wash my hair with. Although it completely dried it out. Also the smell is so overwhelming I had to wash my hair with a different brand shampoo to lessen the smell. And it's not like it's a good smell either it's like beauty supply store perfume. Taking this crap back asap
38,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very unique shampoo.,"This shampoo is like washing with water that cleans. By this I mean it cleans, but when it comes out of the bottle, it's like water. I have never used a shampoo like this before. It also smells like nothing I have ever smelt before. It is a very different kind of shampoo. The bottom line is that it does clean hair."
39,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love it.,"I'm unsure how this product even works, much less how it gets SO FOAMY, with no sulfates. But I'm here for it. It smells like fresh aloe coming straight from the plant, and my hair feels super clean. I'm switching over from previously using monat, and just can't get over how much easier, quicker, and nicer this shampoo is to use!"
40,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than regular shampoo,"I purchased this at the suggestion of a Youtuber I follow. It arrived on time and as described. Using it is quite different from typical shampoo as it has a thinner consistency. Yet, despite the liquidity, it foams instantly and very well. After using it my scalp and hair feel very clean without losing moisture. I often use a scalp massager with it, but I don't think it's necessary to get the full effects."
41,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me.,"The packaging is pretty and it smells fine. My fine, 2C hair instantly becomes a tangled mess with this shampoo. I don’t think I’ve ever used a shampoo that made my hair feel so rough."

I had to give a deep conditioning treatment in order to come through my hair. I did enjoy the scent and the lathering of the shampoo.  This product is terrible on the hair BUT SMELLS AMAZING AND LATHERS GREAT!!!!
43,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Shampoo!,"I was super impressed with this shampoo.  I have very fine, wavy, Caucasian hair that is medium length.  Typical shampoos dry my ends out horribly.  This shampoo did not and my hair feels light and bouncy and not dry.  I did use a conditioner after the shampoo and then a leave in conditioner.  Would never be without this shampoo now!!"
44,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,So many tangles :(,"This smells sooo good and that's why I'm very disappointed that I will probably never use it again. This shampoo is very clarifying, which  I knew before I bought it. It was actually the reason I bought it, it dried my hair out, which is not bad because its supposed to clarify, BUT the tangles I got afterwards were the worst. It took me hours to detangle my hair when it usually does not take that long. I had never seen my hair this tangled before. It did what it was supposed to, however im sure there are other clarifying cleanses out there that will do this job with less tangles."
45,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Non drying,This shampoo is amazing. I have frizzy blonde wavy/curly/ kinky hair and it’s a total pain. I use this on my wash days and it never leaves my hair feeling stripped but it feels clean. Other shampoos make my already hard-to-manage hair even more dry and unruly. The smell is fresh and clean and not overpowering.
46,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Takes a lot to work,Requires lots of product to create suds and feel saturated completely. I typically only apply at the roots and slip down my hair but that doesn’t work well with this clarifier. It requires lots of product to fully clean hair. I’m switching back to my previous clarifier.
47,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight,"This shampoo is unique. Unlike many moisturizing shampoo, it doesn't weight your hair down, doesn't leave residue, but it doesn't dry down my hair either. Pairing with the hair mask it works well for my super long,  straight hair."

As this is a very watery shampoo, I appreciate the squeeze bottle with nozzle.  This cleans well without stripping.  However, if I get some in my eyes- it does irritate/sting.  I use as a detox shampoo between co-washes."

It was more water based than gel like. My hairs long, thick, and needs washing every 2 days. I REALLY like the pointed cap. You run it along your scalp so youre not using more than needed but..it runs out faster than ""normal"" shampoo. Better for shorter hair or people with dry hair."
53,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok but not enough slip or moisture.,Not as much slip as I thought nor as moisturizing as I thought it would be. Pleasantly fragranced. Gave it to my daughter who has braided hair she doesn’t necessarily want to take out after the first week. She likes it.

I liked the tip of the bottle because it was able to get to my scalp easier but other than that, it stripped all of my oils from my hair. As to where my hair was hard. I had to use a lot of conditioner to get my hair back moisturized. Being an African American, my hair needs moisture."

Works pretty good cleaning my hair. Not very moisturizing."
57,"Carol’s Daughter Wash Day Delight Love at First Wash Water To Foam Sulfate Free Shampoo with Aloe and Micellar Water, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, Micellar Shampoo for Kinky, Curly Hair, 16.9 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth a try,"The one convenience I appreciate the most is that applying the shampoo directly to the scalp enables me to apply conditioner to my rest of my hair.  So, even though I dont find the product itself to be moisturizing it allows for moisturizing.  There is no significant scent or color. Also, I don't require as much product so it lasts longer than I expected.I'm  not sure if I will repurchase, but I'm glad to be trying it out."

I love that I can concentrate it on my scalp. It's a very watery texture so it's easy to lather and spread around your scalp. I have a mix of textures ranging from 3b-4c.

I have natural hair and the shampoo did not foam very much for me at all. I don’t usually have a sensitive head but this really irritated my scalp. There were small spots all over my head that felt like they were burning. It cleaned without feeling like it was stripping all my oils out, but the irritation it caused insured I won’t be using this again."

I thought there was no way this ""shampoo"" was going to clean my low porosity 4C hair, but yes it did!  First, it smells lovely.  It has a very clean, fresh smell to it.First, the bottle has a different spout than most shampoos and that is because the shampoo is so thin it's like water.  So, don't put it in your hand.  Put the spout to your scalp and dispense the product that way.  I learned the hard way and put the product in my hand and it just slipped through my fingers like water.  But even though it looks like water, the product foams up really well and it clarified as good as any clarifying shampoo that I've ever tried.  I used a scalp massager and  the shampoo rinsed out really well.  I followed up with a moisturizing shampoo (as I always do), deep conditioned, and my hair was very happy.  Even without any additional product as it air dried it felt pretty soft, so my hair was stripped of all the gunk it hold onto, but did not harshly strip my hair.  This will be my new clarifying shampoo!"

The consistency is as thin as water but it actually does produce lather when worked into my hair. The lather is not as thick and abundant as a 'normal' shampoo, but it produces a decent amount considering that it has the consistency of water.The scent is also unique. It's botanical and a nice change from the usual shampoo scents. It is a bit strong, but the scent does not linger after use.It does not clean my hair as well as a regular shampoo. I can't quantify that other than to say my hair feels cleaner with other shampoos, where as with this it feels somewhat stringy.  The main reason for the low rating, however, is that it causes my scalp to itch. The itchiness stopped after I went back to a regular shampoo, and started up again when I resumed using this so I'm confident the cause is this shampoo. There's no flaking, but rather just an itch that persists throughout the day after using this.I'm not sure what in the shampoo is causing the itch (perhaps the scent?) but it's annoying enough that I won't be using this. An interesting concept for a shampoo, but one that just does not work for me."

The directions say to pair it with a Carol's Daughter conditioner.  So I did!  The shampoo cleans very well (it removes ALL that GEL) but for my hair type I DO NEED a conditioner! So the HOOK for me was the Carol's daughter conditioner I paired it with. The combination of both is awesome! The shampoos preps the hair to receive the amazing hydration benefits of the conditioner. For me, the combination of this shampoo and the Carol's Daughter Almond Milk conditioner gives my 3C/4A high porosity hair the most slip I. HAVE. EVER. HAD.  I'm currently wearing mostly ""wash n go's"" and these products make EVEN my gel laden hair soft and malleable when I refresh it with water. Just the best.  I was so surprised. 💛💛💛"

I have a very oily scalp plus dandruff so the thought of going more than two days without washing always freaked me out. I had done the acv/baking soda wash before and it worked well, but it's very time consuming and I was hoping to find something else before going that route again. I'm SO glad I tried Carols Daughter!!!!!!!! I love the tip to apply just to my scalp. I leave it in for about 5 minutes while I wash/shave then rinse, and then I use conditioner on just my ends. From the first time using, I've been able to go up to a full week without washing again. I thought for sure it would take some time to train my scalp but it was effective immediately. I'm so glad I also found it on Amazon so now I save a couple dollars and it comes to my door. I've gotten my daughter to use it as well, she has the same scalp/hair as me. I truly love this shampoo and next I'm going to try the rose scent. <3"

To apply, the instructions said to aim the open twist cap at scalp.  I find that a bit awkward because the viscosity, the shampoo begins to run down your head as you are placing the bottle down.  It does foam, but it's kind of awkwardly stiff, I found it hard to work through my hair.  It does seem to clean well, but not a product for me."

It is thin like a watery dish soap, and takes a minute to get used to.  The scent is very nice, floral.The bottle is clear and has a lift up style dispenser top.

The first one I ever tried was the Black Vanilla line and I think it was hands down the most horrifying thing I ever put in my hair, so I was hesitant to try this. I loved the idea of a liquid shampoo that goes straight to the roots and it’s been so long since I’ve found a decent detangling conditioner, I figured I had little to lose trying this duo. I LOVED them both, shampoo and conditioner. I used it on myself and my two children and loved the outcome for all three of us even though we all have different hair types. I have loose waves, my daughter has spiral curls and my son’s curls are so tight they more so zigzag than curl. (I know there are number letter combinations for this but I’m not familiar with them). While the shampoo had no major detangling powers, I found the tangles “melted away” with the conditioner.  I didn’t find the shampoo terribly stripping or drying at all but I think I feelings on this matter are relative. It depends on what you like your hair to feel like after shampooing. I like my hair squeaky clean and normally use a serious clarifying shampoo weekly to get that feeling, so by comparison I found the shampoo fairly gentle. However, I think if I were accustomed to a very gentle cleansing, I’d think the shampoo a little harsh. So It probably boils down to preference there. I’m not sure if I’d have loved the shampoo if I hadn’t also used the conditioner, but together...they’re dynamite! A few tips for the road:1.) The Rose water one is SUPER floral. If walking around smelling like a bucket of flowers would be bothersome for you or someone you know...get the other one!2.) The conditioner works wonders when you add water. I thought hmmm...nothing is  happening when I applied it, but I always detangle by further wetting my hair with the conditioner on and that’s when the magic happened (for all 3 of us)."

We all agreed that it cleaned well. One person said it didn’t suds quite enough but worked well anyway. The scent is pleasant and light. This is not a thick gel but a more liquid shampoo. The first time I used it I tried squeezing it into my hand but felt as if it was too liquid to use that way.  Now I wet my hair thoroughly and then just squeeze the shampoo over the top of my head, working the shampoo from the top to the bottom of my hair.

I tried this shampoo because I liked the idea of putting less chemicals on my hair.  The first time I tried it, I wasn't too keen on it.  It didn't lather that well and it didn't make my hair feel clean.  I did notice, however, that it defined the waves in my hair more than my normal shampoo.  On the second try, I used a lot more of the shampoo -- literally squirted it all over my hair -- and it lathered well.  It also made my hair feel like it had been washed.  Again, I noticed it defined my waves more.  This is not my favorite shampoo but it's not a bad shampoo, especially for individuals with curly or wavy hair.

Apparently it was my shampoo and conditioner, whenever I use this shampoo and conditioner in my hair curls up beautiful no matter what products I use afterward. Start with a little on the shampoo and then gradually add more depending on how sudsy you like it. For the conditioner I did a finger in and emulsify between my hands, and then scrunch into the ends, while detangling from the ends up I can figure if I need more or not. Once I’m done detangling I take another finger of conditioner emulsify and rub it into the scalp. Love love love."

I have used this product three times now and I am not a fan. It is a liquid that foams up after you put it in your hair and massage it in. That part I like. What I don't like is how it makes my hair feel. It says that it detangles. However, my hair becomes more tangled when I use this product. I also had a hair cut one week ago which means that my hair is not as susceptible to tangles at the moment.It does say to use this product with the brands conditioner. I only use conditioner every few days because it weighs hair down. When I use this product, I HAVE to use conditioner in order to obtain any softness and to brush my tangled hair.It does leave my hair feeling somewhat clean, but not as clean as my typical shampoo. It feels weird and almost stripped after using. I don't like the feeling and I will probably throw out the rest of the product. It does not work for my hair. I do not recommend it."

I’m super simple, my natural hair prefers a very simple routine. I’ve been an acv rinse girl for a minute, like years honestly and then I found like an occasional lather could be really good for me but I hate everything on the market and I found its bc of the coconut oil + shea butter in the doper natural products.I washed today with a black African soap and then stupidly put Shea butter on my edges and I was like ughh this shea butter is not what you need + how are we going to get it out. 30 minutes later I’m at CVS and 45 minutes later I find this shampoo.And it read so simply that I knew I had to try it. The salicylic acid really intrigued me. I assume it’s to act as a clarifying treatment for the scalp and the hair strands.I used it today. 2nd wash in a day and my hair is back to normal after stupidly using shea butter for the past week as a hair pomade.This product is GOLD. GENIUS. Very novel approach."

I like how easy this is to apply. My hair retained its natural body and was very shiny once dry. It was also easy to comb through despite not using any conditioner. The fragrance is simple, pleasant and very neutral. If you like cucumber scented stuff, then you will probably like this, as it is very similar. This contains Aloe, and I think the aloe scent is probably the one that stands out the most to me. I also really love the bottle, I know this sounds weird but I think it would be great if re-purposed to be a portable bidet, other other useful squeeze bottle. My only real complaint is that I wish this had a lid that snapped on top of the applicator tip so that it was better for travel."

I was looking forward to trying this one. Unfortunately I just don't get it. Granted I may not be the target audience? I have long fine hair. Maybe this would work better with short hair. This shampoo does pour out of the bottle like water, and it did not foam at ALL for me. I used a lot, and really tried, but it would not foam. I even put some in my hand and rubbed - still no lather. At first I found the scent off-putting, but when I realized that it was Aloe, I didn't mind it. I get that this shampoo is supposed to be easier to apply directly to your scalp, and I guess it is.

Used it on my grandson who has extremely curly hair. While I didn't try combing it out totally afterwards, I could at least run my fingers through his hair some. It was really soft!  The biggest plus is the lathering action. I used too much, and will cut back next time, but the amount of lather was spectacular. The grand is half African American half Caucasian with crazy hair. Curly, curly and a bit of straight hair thrown in; a LOT of hair which has  only been trimmed since birth. The length when a curl is pulled straight is about eight inches.

My hair felt clean and nothing too crazy.Then, after a day or two I noticed I didn't get super oily greasy hair in day two of not washing.  This was amazing.  Because of this shampoo, I can go longer between washes, and weird bonus - I washed my face with it and my skin cleared up too. 😂Nevertheless, after years of searching for the perfect shampoo conditioner combo for my thin lifeless hair that gets stringy and greasy fast--this was a godsend.

And let me say this product is amazing! I have long brown wavy hair and have been disappointed with all recent scalp scrubs/cleansers Ive purchased - since I cant even get them right on my scalp and instead they wind up just all over my hair. This product is hands down my favorite. The liquid product is prefect with the nozzle making sure it gets right on the scalp. It removed ALL build up on my scalp which I had been struggling with, and my scalp felt amazing all day long! It did feel slightly stripped after washing it out which I was not fond of; however I wont stop using this scalp cleanser and I will instead use it monthly as a great refresher. I cant say enough good things about it. Just focus the liquid on your scalp and when you rinse it off it will run down through your hair - no need to work it through your strands. Also use a decent conditioner after and you will be all set!"

I seen other curly girls use this saying it's perfect.  Honestly it smells great and the top is a plus! But it completely stripped my hair leaving it with a squeaky clean noise that wasn't great. It was do dry it was almost as if ny hair was matting together! I applied my shea moisture deep conditioner after as I also do after I shampoo and I don't think it helped any. I definitely rather the Pantene over this. I'm not sure how long it will take to go back to normal. I'll be returning this to Target tomorrow!

From the applicator tip, to the water-like thickness of the formula that almost magically foams up once you start to work it in, to the amazing grassy-herbal scent, there is absolutely NOTHING I do not love about Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight! My hair feels so clean and I love that it's not weighed down at all after I use it.  I wash my hair once or twice a week and I can honestly say on wash days I start thinking about this shampoo hours before I use it and can't keep my hands out of my hair for hours afterwards. I'm completely obsessed, telling all my friends and anyone who will listen to BUY. THIS. SHAMPOO!  I know I sound like a maniac.  Anyway, just keeping my fingers crossed for a conditioner in the same line."

Like the ingredient list compared to many shampoos out there. However this one is not my favorite. They say you’re supposed to squirt it directly on your hair as it’s pretty much a water consistency however I find that very hard to control how much I’m using. I still end up squirting it into my hand first. Has very low suds to it. Seems to clean my hair however it does seem to leave my head/scalp and little itchy.  Leaves my hair fairly soft feeling. Overall does it work?… Yes. Is it my favorite… No.  I think I will stick with some of their other products instead.

It doesn't make my hair fell slippery when I'm washing it, like shampoo does.  It makes it feel tacky.  I wasn't sure how that was going to work, but I gave it a try anyways.  I always use conditioner after I shampoo.  It rinses out easily, and actually does leave my hair feeling soft and not greasy.  I like the results, and I was surprised.  I thought my hair was going to be a mess after using this, but it wasn't."

Not stripping, but not moisturizing either; that's how I like it, because I don't want any residues from my shampoo getting between my conditioner and my strands. The applicator bottle is my favorite feature and allows me to truly get down to my scalp through my dense head of hair.Use a little for a gentle clean, use a little more for a very rich lather. It doesn't have much of a scent."

It smells okay, not my favorite but it's not bad. It also works well for not stripping my hair or making it feel dry. I have 3b/c natural hair and I'm big on getting products that are paraben, sulfate, and silicone free since they dry out my hair and make my curls fall flat and frizz. This works well for ""wash day"" shampoo. Not too harsh. Definitely not my favorite but it works well."

I personally did not care for it, as my hair didn't feel especially soft or anything.

I usually have to dilute shampoo in a bottle with a nozzle to put it on my scalp. With this shampoo, because it is liquid and it comes in a bottle with a nozzle, I can easily put the shampoo on my scalp without having to cut the shampoo.  A little goes a long way. For this to be a sulfate-free shampoo, the lather is amazing. My scalp always feels clean, but not stripped, and my hair doesn't get all dried out.I hope this product doesn't get discontinued. I love it!"

But I actually really like this shampoo. The fragrance is light and very clean-smelling. The nozzle allows you to get right down into your scalp. I try not to wash the ends of my hair too much, so that is perfect. The price is reasonable, too!"

When the liquid formula is poured out of the bottle straight to the hair, it turns to foam lather and cleans hair.  Does not feel like stripping hair.  I have straight hair and use this shampoo occasionally for clarifying.  I recommend using same brand conditioner after shampooing for softer hair if using daily."

The first shampoo didn't lather up much, but the repeat shampoo lathered up a lot more.  It takes a little more shampoo than I expected and i have short hair.

The nozzle is brilliant. It deposits the product directly on your scalp so you actually clean your scalp and not just your hair.

I can’t believe how healthy this makes my hair look. I actually like my hair for the first time in my life. I haveAlways said my hair was just wavy enough to be annoying but not attractive. This makes my hair actually look wavy and beautiful. The smell is very organic and earthy but I like it. The conditioner has a little more of a flowery smell but it doesn’t linger on my hair. I noticed a difference in how my hair looked and felt with the first use. I can’t see ever using another product. I’m so happy with this shampoo.
1,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite so far,"I started using this brand a year ago and have tried almost every shampoo and conditioner. THIS is my favorite so far. The SCENT is amazing and it might be too much for some but it smells so sweet and my hair actually smells like something other than wet hair when I wash it. The scent even lingers after it's dry. Lathers very nicely and my hair felt so smooth and healthy. The bottles are also HUGE so this will last a while. I'm smitten with Carol's Daughter's.Update: I'm currently on my second bottle of the shampoo and conditioner, and have added the scalp oil and leave in conditioner to my routine. I do not understand the negative reviews about the smell of the shampoo and conditioner because I think they smell divine! My hair has been so health since I started using this and feels so soft after washing. And don't even get me started on the LATHER of the shampoo.The scalp oil and leave in conditioner do have a...odd and very strong smell. But they work extremely well for keeping my hair moisturized and OMG I've noticed my hair actually feels SOFT after using them and not greasy. After wasking my hair I apply the oil directly to my scalp and then scrunch in the leave in conditioner. I like the let my hair dry in boxer braids and when I take them out I have the most gorgeous, healthy, soft curls I've ever had.This hair care line is a. Life. Saver. I know every body and hair is different, so it might not work for everyone, but this is my holy grail."

I’ve got Hashimoto’s Thyroid disease which typically makes your hair fall out. I’ve bought dozens of serums, vitamins and treatments. Nothing helps. My hair typically looks dry & thin & lifeless. While I’ve given up trying to “fix” my hair problems…Carol's Daughter products seemed like they might be nice.I bought this shampoo plus the conditioner.I’m very pleased with both. My thin fine hair feels healthier after just 2 uses. And my usually unobservant husband commented on my hair looking nice & shiny. A big plus - I usually need to use a nearly full palm worth of shampoo and conditioner - this stuff is concentrated. I only need a fraction of this compared to other brands."

My husband immediately noticed along with a few people who hugged me and asked why I smelt like nicotine or if I had started smoking. You can tell the company tried really hard to mask the black castor oil “tobacco” scent with a really nice perfume scent but it just doesn’t work. The saddest part is that my hair really liked the formula! It was really soft and silky. Carols daughter please use a different castor oil without the tobacco scent! You’ll sell way more of these!

47,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This shampoo packaging is nice and classy and you get a decent amount of product for the price. The shampoo is thinner than I was expecting, but gives a nice lather, less is more. After using this on my hair for the first time, I felt that my hair was mildly softer than when I use my standard shampoo and it left my hair feeling clean and healthy with no premature grease before the next wash.The reason for the poor rating is the smell. I have used other products by Carol's Daughter in the past and have noticed that some of the products tend to have a strong smell, but usually I am a fan of the scents. That wasn't the case with this shampoo. I smelled this product direct from the bottle and while I could tell the scent was strong, I didn't realize how strong until I used it. The scent of this product is heavy and acrid. It smelled to me like chemicals mixed with burning oil. The scent was so strong that it actually gave me a headache, and I don't have strong scent sensitivity. With that said, scent is such a personal thing, many people may absolutely love the smell. The scent stayed on my hair for hours, even after using a citrus scented conditioner it was still strong. My whole bathroom smelled like this shampoo and I had to air the room out.Overall, I would recommend this product to those that adore strong smells and healthy hair. To anyone with a sensitivity to smells or to those that dislike their hair to smell long after a shower, avoid this one."

It’s not my favorite scent but it had a great lather, the next time I used it I didn’t use nearly as much shampoo and it was plenty so a little goes a long way. I love that it doesn’t have any harsh ingredients and for my dry damaged hair this shampoo did wonders! It smoothed out my hair, added much needed moisture and shine! I need to get the conditioner next!! Great all natural shampoo"
49,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"When I first applied and started washing my hair it felt like a luxurious head massage. I just did not want this hair wash to be over.  It felt that good. It has a mild great fragrance. The scent of it is not overpowering. I have a product that I use now that I love and it really works very well for my hair. I was apprehensive about using a new product. Big Mistake… This product is the best.  I am a baby boomer and most of us are suffering from thinning, breaking and dry hair. We need a very moisturizing and strengthening product.  First, let me say this Shampoo is very moisturizing. Its ingredients include Castor oil, Black seed oil, and Ginger. It also has included Anti Breakage Hair Oil and Leave-In-Conditioner.  It is Sulfate and Paraben free. No Artificial Colors and it is Vegan.Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength system includes a conditioner, leave-in cream and a 7 oil blend hair and scalp oil. At this time I really have to take care of my hair very well because it will become dry, thin, and break. With the aging process, my hair grows slowly, thin out, breakage and very dry which I experience all of those.This product I will purchase the whole system to help strengthen my hair. This is a great product. I was hesitant at first but make sure you are not. I would purchase this again and again."
50,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked this shampoo! I think it would have been more effective if I had used it with the matching conditioner, but as far as reviewing it solely based as a stand alone shampoo, I was still pleased.Product comes in a squeeze out dispenser. The shanooonis actually thicker than I had anticipated and you only need a small amount to larger up. I dispensed what I would normally dispense with other shampoos and it was too much. So a little goes a long way. It left my hair feeling refreshed and clean. My hair didn’t feel particularly moisturized but also didn’t feel dried out after use. Using this with their conditioner would probably have left my hair feeling more moisturized. The smell was a little herby straight out of the bottle, but did not really linger when my hair was dried.This product is vegan and is free of sulfates, parabens and artificial colors. It uses natural ingredients like black cumin seeds, ginger and castor oil to nourish your hair. And I’m all about the benefits of natural ingredients which was a definite bonus for me. I also love the backstory that comes with this product. Created by a working mom reminding women that they are Goddesses. Love it.Would recommend and will likely purchase the conditioner because I like the shampoo so much."
51,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"To say the shampoo market is over-saturated (pun intended) is an overstatement of epic proportions. This one, however, is an absolute winner.For a reference point: I have fairly thin hair, typical of a dude in his early 40s (thinning in the middle with some recession). My wife, big and awesome curly hair. We both LOVE this shampoo.Why? We both have scalp issues, and it didn't irritate. It smells friggin FANTASTIC. Awesome composition, as so little goes such a long way. It washes out easily. And both of us experienced advertised strengthening of hair. This is the probably the only shampoo we've both used with similar A+ ratings.My only criticism? Packaging. They'd be better served with a proper seal. The annoying 'Amazon liquid purchase leaking' was alive and well, needing a proper exterior rinsing. But a small criticism for a surprisingly amazon hair care product."
52,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo has a thick and creamy consistency when lathered so it takes a bit longer to wash it out all the way. For this reason, you don't need to use as much as you might think which will make the bottle last longer. I have not really noticed any of the advertised benefits but I suppose you would have to use it for a long time and also use the conditioner and oil to really reap any of the benefits. The one major drawback for me is the smell. The scent of this shampoo is horrendously awful. The best way I can describe it is to imagine a bunch of very fragrant herbs and leaves that have been been doused with cigarette smoke. Yuck."

It smells delicious and makes my hair feel so soft. I tend to have a lot of breakage in my hair and I noticed that when I washed with this shampoo I had less hair falling out in the shower. I switched over to another shampoo for a couple weeks and it wasn't so great for my hair. A couple washes with this shampoo and my hair was back to being smooth and soft. Very impressed with the quality and again, the smell is amazing. For the price it doesn't hurt to give it a try, I'm sure you'll love it."
54,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells is disgusting,"I cannot believe they let this shampoo go to stores smelling like this. It smells like a grandma who chain smokes all day long. 2 hours later, and my hair still reeks, even after using scented conditioner. My wavy hair does feel softer, but that’s bc it’s totally limp. And now it stinks, too. I only wash my hair like twice a week, but I don’t know if I can hold out that long. I bought this bc the store was out of my normal shampoo. I’ll never buy a bottle without opening it ever again."
55,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have no love for any particular brand of shampoo, and I’m always willing to try a different one that I usually use because it’s fun to try new ones; I might find one that is THE ONE. And, to be honest, I have many brands in my bathroom. I was glad to be offered this to give it a try. I color my hair frequently so it can get brittle at times. I tried this, and my hair immediately felt better. It felt softer, and it felt like maybe it wasn’t quite as brittle. However, the smell wasn’t great. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t terrible, but the smell wasn’t really a smell I liked. However, that’s more of a personal preference, and the shampoo seems to be working well. Recommend!"

Leaves my hair feeling soft and nourished.  I'm very sensitive to fragrance smells, having tossed many a bottle on smell alone.  I find this Carol's Daughter formula to smell quite pleasant.  It's not natural in an essential oil sense, but the fragrance is very mild and pleasing.  The only knock is this shampoo is not cheap, once you look at it on a per ounce basis.  That said, I'm quite fond of it, one of my favorite shampoos of the year."

58,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have used this shampoo several times and it does a good job of cleaning my hair without stripping, and it has a most unusual but delightful scent.  The first shampoos didn't lather up a whole lot, but on the repeat I get a big lather.  It rinses out nicely but doesn't leave my hair with that ""squeaky clean"" feeling.  I like that it has some extra oils in it to help with damaged/dry hair.  My hair felt clean and soft after blow-drying and overall I think it's a good shampoo - just kind of pricey."

The lather was creamy and fabulous. I really enjoyed the process of shampooing my hair! I followed with my own conditioner for detangling (I have very long fine tangle-prone hair). It was easy to comb through my hair, which I air dried as usual. My hair really did look healthier than normal, very shiny and healthy."

85,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,BUY THIS.. Transformed my hair!,"I have a million great things I could say about this product. I have fine/thin hair and had been struggling to find a shampoo and conditioner combo that worked for me. I’ve tried high end products, Olaplex etc for my damaged and dry hair. I was at my wits end and almost gave up. I found Carols Daughter products through Amazon and decided to give it a try.A LITTLE bit goes a long way with this shampoo (and conditioner) the shampoo lathers better than any that I have used. The shampoo/conditioner combo has left my hair feeling and looking better than it has in YEARS. Just the right amount of moisture (does not weigh down even my fine hair), the scent is very subtle (I’m not a fan of strong fragranced hair products) and the bottle lasts a long time.If you are struggling with finding your daily hair washing product, look no further. I recommend this again and again."
86,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Fortifying Sulfate Free Shampoo with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 11 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,All around amazing,I daughter loves everything about this shampoo and conditioner. Her hair is so soft.
0,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Do It,"I bought the full set like a fool. Shampoo, conditioner and hair mask ruined my hair texture. Left my hair feeling dry, brittle and it made me shed more. A waste of money. I have come to loath this brand. They have alcohol in leave-in condotioner. Why the heck would you put alcohol in leave in conditioner? That dries out the hair. Ugh, don't use this company."
1,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to love...,"I really wanted to love this product. I've used it for a few weeks now and my hair is worse, not better. It made my scalp super itchy and left my hair feeling like straw. I lost quite a bit of hair as well. More so then my previous shampoos. I've never had a problem with itchy scalp before. Really bummed. It also smells like sunscreen, which is ok if you want to smell like that. The only good thing is that it dried my hair out so well, I didn't have to wash it as often! I have fine/thin hair. I'm glad it works for most, but not for me :( Off to find another shampoo!"
2,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this shampoo. Makes my hair soft.,"I am so glad I found this shampoo at Costco.  I tried it and loved it at first shampoo.  Since Costco doesn't sell them anymore at the store, I bought it on Amazon.  It's costly here on Amazon. The price was better at Costco. This shampoo (and the conditioner) make my dry hair softer and healthier. So far, it's the best moisturizing shampoo and conditioner I have used for my hair type (my hair gets dry easily in the summer). It smells nice and feels good. Give it a try if you have dry hair."
3,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Product is okay, no better than any other ""Carol's Daughter"" product","I've use Carol Daughter's products for years.  For the price of this specific product line, I thought I was going to get something significantly better.  I must say that this product is no better than any other Carol's Daughter product.  Don't waste money on this one if you don't have to.  The other products work just as well and cost less."
4,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair is fine and thin,"My hair is fine and thin. Always has been. This shampoo is a delight. Leaves my hair looking fuller. I love it. A tiny bit goes a long way so it will last a long time. Believe me, I have, with high hopes, purchased many shampoos and wound up flushing them down the toilet in disgust. This one is a keeper."
5,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not my favorite carols daughter product,I feel like this made my hair weird. Most carols daughter products I only use once a week and with this shampoo and conditioner I had to wash more often and the conditioner did not work for my hair! My hair is very long and not curly but wavy and frizzy  for texture comparison. I am thinking maybe curlier dryer hair might be more the type this is designed for.
6,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Shampoo and Conditioner,I can't tell if I am reviewing for the shampoo or conditioner but I must say that conditioner is worth every dime of the twenty dollars. You don't need a whole lot of either (which is good because you don't get a whole lot). The conditioner goes farther than the shampoo and if I was in a bind to get one or the other I would honestly get the goddeses shampoo and use this conditioner to save a few bucks. Overall Carol's Daughter has amazing products and I love supporting them.
7,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Win For Me,"I wasn't sure how my hair would respond to this brand, so at first, I bought a trial size kit. I fell in love with it after the first use!!!! I noticed it was so uch easier to detangle my hair. I brought it with me to a hair appointment.... my hairstylist said the same thing. She said my hair responds well to this brand........ that was in 2013. I've using this brand ever since."
8,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product Line including the Shampoo,I stopped using shampoo on my natural hair because it would dry it out so bad and I could barely comb my hair through even after extensive conditioning.  Over time that cycle left my hair damaged and I had to start cutting my growth until I started the Monoi line to include the shampoo.It's a really good shampoo.
9,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,A little too squeaky clean,"This shampoo is just okay imo. Smells makes me think I'm in Hawaii but this is the kind of shampoo that when you apply to your hair may make it feel a little too clean/stripped. To the point that your hair feels squeaky when you're rinsing it out. Doesn't make my hair soft or feel very nourishing. I use it every week or two now to ""deep clean"" my hair but then use a more gentle shampoo on alternating days through the week."
10,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Shampoo!,"I have fine hair that gets ragged and frazzled at the drop of a hat. When I color it just gets worse. This calms down my cuticle and just makes my hair manageble. I will never use another shampoo again after using this one.Plus the smell is just devine.If you're on the fence about buying it, don't be. Its terrific."
11,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed--there are better shampoos out there,"I initially bought this shampoo to see if it would help with my hair loss, since my friend recommended me to use sulfate-free shampoos. I used this for about month and saw no change in the amount of hair I lost. My hair felt thicker and stronger for the first week or so, but this effect eventually went away. I also felt that the shampoo was very drying and caused my hair to become more oily.Because this shampoo did nothing for my hair loss, I bought Aveda's Invati shampoo and Khiel's Amino Acid Shampoo and used all three shampoos interchangeably. For some reason, while the Invati and Amino Acid shampoos consistently reduced the amount of hair I lost in the shower every day, the Carol's Daughter shampoo made me lose much more hair every time I used it.So if you're looking for a gentle shampoo to help with hair loss, I would not go with this product! There are much better shampoos out there for a similar price."
12,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good shampoo,"This shampoo is very good. It definitely moisturizes and strengthen your hair. It works well with the conditioner too.  Before I started using this, I was losing a lot of hair when I brushed it while it was wet. Now very little hair is in the brush or comb."
13,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,... purchased the Shampoo and Conditioner and I'am absolutely in love with the product,"I purchased the Shampoo and Conditioner and I'am absolutely in love with the product. Where has it been my whole life??If you have very dry hair (I have thyroid condition), this is the best product! I have been through a lot of products, tried top high end shampoos but nothing worked better than Carol's Daughter. Terrific!"
14,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Watch Out !,"Likes: Smell is not strong at all, bottles twist cap to dispense, after shampoo and conditioner hair is left softDislikes: a lot of shampoo is needed to get a good lather on textured hair, mid wash hair felt straw like and was tangled almost matted.Not worth the price !!"
15,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves Hair Soft,The light scent could be a problem for people very sensitive to smells. Cleans hair without stripping oils. hair is soft & moisturized.
16,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought on a whim - will forever forward use,"Discovered it and thought I'd give it a try.  It made an immediate, positive change on my wavy hair.  Pricey, but worth it."
17,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carol's Daughter's products are wonderful,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Line, especially the leave-in conditioner saved my hair from doom due to using Wen Shampoo cleansers on my beautiful hair for only 2 weeks. This shampoo works great, but it does remove a lot of my semi-perma hair color. Maybe I need to go to Permanent color, or stock up on what I already use."
18,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT shampoo with less than satisfying  lid.,"It is  a  really great shampoo.  Leaves hair soft,Shiney and manageable , but the lid doesn't  dispense well.  IT plugs and blows off.  The lid won't  screw back onto the bottle."
19,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not hydrating enough but smells good,"It was drying to my hair and could not be used without a conditioner.  The smell is fabulous just like the conditioner, but it needs either the wash out conditioner from Carol's Daughter or one of her excellent leave in conditioner.  Shampoo needs to be more hydrating though."
20,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,"Love this product!!! My hair has severely lessened in breakage since purchasing this product and I’ve only used it 3 times. I combined it with the conditioner and do a deep condition and it makes it ultra soft. Definitely will continue to buy this combination for my hair, I think I’ve found the right blend I can keep!"
21,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This shampoo is awesome.,I love the shampoo. I am a swimmer. It cleans my scalp and removes chlorine from my hair.
22,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn’t like it, very sticky",This product I was told was incredible. This product leaves a sticky uncomfortable feeling all over my hair and body and I think it is a fake product. I tried it a few times and it is so strange. I had to use a different shampoo to remove the sticky film.

31,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard plastic bottle. Can't squeeze product out.,It moisturize the hair. Not crazy about the smell..the hard plastic bottle made it impossible to get any product out..you shake it and shake it like ketchup bottle

33,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great shampoo,Keeps hair nice and soft.
34,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a fan...,"I read a lot of super positive reviews on this so perhaps my expectations were too high.. I have really long hair so it tangles easily and I get a lot of fallout. This product helped neither of these issues. I noticed that the shampoo didn't leave my hair feeling moisturized, but actually kind of straw-like. It also takes a bit more squeezing to get the product out than I'd prefer. It doesn't lather very well or spread nicely. I found myself having to squeeze more out just to get some on my neck's hairline. I have read reviews of other higher-end shampoos and conditioners that said they felt like the product received was a counterfeit version, so perhaps that is the case here. But for the actual product received, I wasn't impressed and won't be buying it again. Also, the smell wasn't quite awful, but it wasn't good either."
35,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,does what it says,great shampoo makes hair very soft and smells good fights frizz

38,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It does my hair justice,"I read some of the reviews. For my hair it does a nice job, I have tight cork screw hair that is soft and it is hard getting the comb through it without damage.  I purchased the trial size which is a little costly, but I liked it enough to but the regular size. It works best with the conditioner"

42,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing but not heavy or greasy. Great for fine hair!,Absolutely the best shampoo for delicate hair that has been color treated!
43,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm a fan,"I was skeptical after my stylist recommended this brand - had never heard of it and it was a bit pricey at the salon.  (I have waist length, fine hair and am using the Monio Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner, as well as the Split End serum).Wasn't blown away after the first wash, although I did immediately enjoy the scent.  The shampoo actually does a great job of lathering despite the lack of sulfates.It was the third wash that did it.  I noticed my hair was shinier, softer to the touch, and got tangled less frequently.  (Pssst!  A dab will do ya with the serum; too much and your hair is weighed down - I have a lot of hair, and I use about a jelly bean size).I have since recommended it to my gal pals and will continue to do so."
44,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,How does this have such good reviews?,"I am so confused by all the rave reviews. After using Color Oops in an attempt to remove hair color and being left with an extremely frizzy, damaged, broken head of hair, I searched frantically for the repairing conditioner/shampoo with the highest reviews on Amazon. This one is pretty pricey, but the reviews convinced me. Over the course of two months of using this, I've seen nothing but the deteoriation of my hair. It's left my hair extremely dry, brittle, and with more breakage than ever. My hair is currently a mess, but I've seen more repair on it within a week of using the It's A 10 Miracle Hair Mask than I have using this for two months. Not to mention it is ridiculously overpriced. And yes, I used it in pair with the shampoo."
45,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth a try if you have problem hair,"I have fine, limp, fragile hair that is color treated. My scalp/roots are oily, while my ends are dry like straw. And I have a major problem with hair fall. This lathers better than any other sulfate free shampoo I have tried. I don't feel like it gets my scalp and roots 100% clean, but again, its an improvement over other sulfate free shampoos I have tried. I absolutely cannot skip a day without my roots becoming a greasy mess, but my ends seem softer and less straw-like with this shampoo. I don't know about the claims of reduction in hair fall. I can't say for sure I'm seeing less hair in my comb or shower drain. I really like the scent. The price is a little steep."
46,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good-hair-day in a bottle,"This is such a fantastic formula. Leaves my hair feeling sooo soft and velvety, and gives it a nice healthy shine. I always have a good hair day whenever I use this!"
47,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not please,I have purchase Monoi directly from the  companyThey were out so I decided to order fromYouDoesn’t smell like monoi left white flakes in hair
48,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,I would definitely recommend!,It smells amazing!!! My hair feels so much more healthy too. I’m really glad I decided to try this.
49,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Shampoo,"It's decent. Not a bad shampoo, although I've used others (like Suave with Shea Butter, strangely) that seem to do a better job of moisturizing. Considering the price difference between this & Suave, I'm not likely to purchase this again."
50,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works...I will use this 4ever,"I use the entire system of products and my hair is in great condition. I have fine long blonde hair and I color or do the roots about every 3 mos. I was having a huge slow down in growth, as well, I was shedding big time. If my fine hair had a snag or tangle, forget it - a chunk of like 20 strands would come out. Haven't seen that since using monoi! Also, there is literally no hair on my comb after using now. I have been using this for 4 months. It's an easy to use system. Also, I discovered it from my mother in law who uses it, and she is black with straightened/permed hair so I'm pretty sure this works well for everyone, as the two of us have completely different hair types but we both love the CD Monoi products!"
51,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carol’s Daughter,Love scent
52,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for thick wavy hair,"I bought this mainly for my husband's thick, wavy red hair as the reviews sounded like it would be moisturizing and strengthening. Well he's been using it all week and his hair is forming thick, luscious curls instead of 'poofing' out like it usually would with our other Sulfate-free shampoos. I think this product smells great, too - pleasant and light, good for both of our use. Also, after reading the poor reviews about the cap and some user's difficulty in figuring out how to use it, I have to say it's actually pretty intuitive. Once you turn it counterclockwise (which is how you universally open things on planet earth), the center hole in the top opens and you simply squeeze the shampoo out. It's clean and easy - we love it. It's actually been pretty awesome for my superfine straight hair. The ends look moisturized and I don't have the little fly-a-ways I usually have to smooth down with leave-in conditioner. So far so good with this stuff!"
53,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great and a little goes a long way!,Love the smell and how silky soft it leaves my hair. Also love that a little goes a long way

Also, it takes very little to suds up!"
59,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,very nice product,This product has helped my hair to stop falling out and to start to grow
60,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product keep out of eyes!,I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5. It lathers really well. Unlike Wen. I accidentally got a little bit in my eyes and it burned really bad. My eyes were red and burning ( I thought I was going to need a life alert to get out of the shower). When it says use small amount of shampoo they mean it. The smell is strong either you love it or hate it. I noticed less hair in my brush and in my shower. Would recommend using the conditioner also. Didn't leave hair feeling greasy or weighed down.

69,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was doubtful at first, but I love this product.","I initially purchased this product because my sister said that she loves it. My sister has natural hair. My hair is relaxed. So I was unsure if this was the correct one to purchase, but it is. The bottle says reduces shedding by 95% on the first use. I still had a lot of shedding, but on my 3rd time using it I could see an improvement. My hair and scalp was hydrated and my shedding was reduced greatly. I only purchased the shampoo, but I'm going to purchase the conditioner as well. It's a little pricey, but well worth it."
70,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,This shampoo smells great and it works.  I have salt and pepper hair.  This shampoo does not strip my hair color when I cover the grey.  I have been using this brand for two years now.

76,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my hair type,"Carol's daughter products don't work well with me but i thought i'd give this a try after reading the review, plus it had been several years since i had tried their products. this product makes my hair feel like straw. it smells great though but definitely a waste of money for me. My hair type is a mixture of curly, wavy, kinky and straight, very thick and heavy."

78,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Love CD products, but this product struck out.","This product is horrible. I am black Hispanic with curly/frizzy hair. I only use sulfate-free shampoos like this one. I love Carol's Daughter Tui and Black Vanilla lines. So I was stunned when I washed my hair this morning with Monoi shampoo and my hair immediately became rough, brittle, and fell out in the shower in clumps. It is awful. This is by far the worst hair product I've used in recent memory. I don't understand how a sulfate-free shampoo leaves my hair feeling more dry, brittle, and broken than a clarifying shampoo. Blowing out my hair took twice as long. Will not be using this again."

You literally see the difference after one use.  Don't let the cost put you of, the benefit to your hair is well worth it.

I have thick black hair and my hair always frizzes up after the shower but after 2 washes with this stuff and the sister conditioner WOW!!! Shiny non-frizzy really a dream in a bottle.

119,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's not great but does the job,I was hoping to see 96% breakage prevention in first use. Have only used it twice so far. Makes my hair dry. There is a minimized breakage for sure but would not say as effective as they advertise.
120,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,I had been using this product for 2 years. You can see the different on your hair the same day you first use it.  My hair was breaking a lot do to over processing and as soon as i started to use this shampoo and conditioner as well my hair brakeage was reduce abut 80% . I will recommend this product.
121,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,On the plus side it smells nice.,I have been using this shampoo and the conditioner for about 2 weeks and have not noticed any change in my hair. Breaks just as much and is still very tangly and hard to brush. It also makes my hair greasy more quickly. On the plus side it smells nice.
122,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product-,"I've used this shampoo for a few years on my then relaxer hair and now on my natural hair and I have always been pleased with it, no dislikes here."

125,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't repair,I found the shampoo drying. My hair breaks constantly and I've tried many things including that monoi conditioning cream. Neither product worked for for me. I had hoped for more. Not everything works for everybody. I do like the cowash as a basic cleansers.
126,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Will not purchase again,AS said with the conditioner.......not any better and MUCH more expensive than a store brand.Disappointed! Because of amazons return policy of used items I cannot return!
127,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work,This product smells great.  that's about it.  I have seen more breakage since using this shampoo then ever before.  Not worth the money

After using this shampoo for about 3 weeks my hairdresser asked me what I have done to my hair!  She said it feels thicker and in better condition.  I told her about Carol's Daughter shampoo and she said she wants to buy some!  Now every time I go the beauty shop she still comments on how much my hair has improved.  I see an improvement also, softer and feels thicker."

The prices vary on Amazon, so compare the different sellers.  I would highly recommend!"
133,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"I've been using the shampoo and conditioner for about two months now. I wasn't sure if I was having less breakage as other reviewers wrote, but then I realized that when I put my hot rollers in, I used to use 11 rollers, occasionally 12, but now 12 are just barely enough. I either have more hair or thicker hair. I get compliments on the shine, too. I'm about halfway through each bottle now and will probably treat myself and purchase it again when these bottles are empty."

142,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"This Product Does Not Live Up To The Claims.  Also, It Hurts / Burns Your Eyes.","I don't write a review unless I'm blown away or very disappointed.  Well, you can guess where this is going.  I bought these products, shampoo, conditioner & hair mask (as recommended), because the claims, verbally and on the bottles, are that they reduce hair breakage / hair falling off your head by 92 or 96 percent (depending on which product you're looking at).  I used all three products. I saw a very, very minimal difference.  Simply put, the hair is still falling off my head, just a little bit slower.  I went from Very Excited when ordering, to Very Disappointed after using these products.Worst of all, your eyes may hurt / burn when you use this stuff.  And we know that's not good.  I don't know if it was 1, 2 or all 3 of these products that did that.  The way I figure it, if a product burns your eyes, it's not worth using.  I had a problem of frequent burning of the eyes when using this product.  If I have to be super, super careful to not get it in my eyes, then it's not worth the hassle because I'm discovering that hair fall-out is natural to some degree."

It was so awful i returned everything the very next day!!3years later I decided to give it another try, only the shampoo this time because I was sooo In loovee with the smell. I thought the shampoo wouldnt do any damage but boy was i wrong. My hair always feels super soft and shines to the max due to other products i use but this monoi shampoo had my hair feeling like i just bleached it. It was Awful!! No shine, super Dry, hard hair, straw, and I my hair began to shed all over my shirt! I hateeee Monoi products.The smell is very pleasing though."

I have long, fine, blond, color processed hair and this shampoo makes my scalp feel oily and my hair flat no matter how much I try to rinse it out.  The bottom of my hair does really well with it but I can't put it on my scalp.  I tried it over and over again hoping for different results but it disappoints every time.  I also feel like it leaves my hair really dangled and I have to use a strong spray in detangler to comb it out.  I hate to throw the bottle away so I will be using the shampoo on my ends only and something else on my scalp."

I just tried Wen products, but they made my scalp itchy and my hair feels coated.  With Carol's Daughter Monoi products, my hair is happy!I won't try anything else in the future, I'm sticking with Monoi. Also, my friend had told me thatthe skin products are the only thing she will use, and she has VERY sensitive skin, andshe is very picky!  I love the fragrance of these products, they remind me of a bubble bath I had as a child, and have alwaystried to find that fragrance, so this is a big plus!  I am going to go stock up now, I don't EVER want to be without Carol's Daughter Monoi products, shampoo, conditioner and hair mask!"
155,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,I have had the pleasure of trying quite a few of the Carol's Daughter shampoos and conditioners.  This one is not bad but to be honest not my favorite either. I felt like it left my hair clean and soft after I washed it however the softness did not last all day. By the end of the day my hair almost feels a little drier than before I started using the shampoo.  I'm sure using a conditioner would solve this problem however due to testing this product I have gone without conditioner for the past week just to see what the shampoo does on its own. ( Sidenote: most times I don't use conditioner anyhow. So still trying to compare apples to apples so to speak. )  Shampoo has a pleasant scent to it. Does not really lather very well as with most of their products I've noticed....but still leaves my hair feeling very clean afterwards.  As far as the packaging I'm not crazy about it. I just have to leave the lid open all the time. When your hands are wet it is very hard to open this twist top with no place to really grip without it slipping.  As with pretty much all their products I love that it is sulfate free!  You want to clean your hair not strip it.
156,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair nightmare,"I wouldn't even give this product a one star if I didn't have to. I brought the whole set the shampoo, conditioner, the hair mask, and the leave in conditioner This is the worst product I have ever put in my hair. I'm in the middle of transitioning back to natural and my natural hair texture is 4a all of the products left my hair dry, tangled, and a matted mess. I have lost so much hair (literally two handfuls) getting all the knots and tangles out to the point of having a major set back with my hair. I am beyond upset. Do not believe the hype ladies I would never recommend this product line to anyone"
157,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Smelling Shampoo That Claims to Strengthen Brittle Hair,"Unlike other shampoos, this comes with a twist-off cap. It has a perfume-like fragrance but fortunately it's not that strong, and after you wash it out, the scent becomes mild, like any other shampoo. That said, the scent is pleasant and I wouldn't have minded it lasting longer. It lathers up very well and my hair felt softer and looked very clean after I used it.The label claims it's best for dry or color-treated hair and reputedly strengthens your strands so that less of it gets brittle and breaks off. I have thinning hair and my hair is so brittle sometimes as to shed a lot.  So this benefit is welcome, though after a few washes I haven't noticed a big difference in the durability of my hair; I'm still shedding.  Overall it seems to work as well as other shampoos I have but my main gripe is that I still shed and it doesn't add much volume."
158,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,The scent is far too overwhelming for me!,"I like using many of the Carol's Daughters products. They tend to work well on my frizzy prone hair. The main issue I have with this shampoo is the overwhelming smell! It is not a gentle coconut infused scent at all. It almost felt like I had an allergic reaction, the smell was that strong. It's overpowering. I am very sensitive to smells and when I read the ingredients, I saw the perfume ingredients. Also, although it's sulfate-free, I always get a bit leery when I can't pronounce or recognize the ingredients in a product. And this is stocked with ingredients that I could not recognize.I will use Carol's Daughters products in the future, but not this one."
159,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this shampoo. I didn't even comb my hair after using this -- just blew it dry -- and it was straight and tangle-free. (I do have straight hair to begin with.) I didn't use conditioner, either -- just used this shampoo twice; rinsed twice.The scent is divine! It's flowery; perhaps a combination of gardenia and maybe frangipani? With a touch of coconut.I can easily go every other day using this, maybe every three days depending on how active I am. Hair still looks great.They've included Monoi Oil in this and I am wondering if it's Plumeria (frangipani), but it's an ancient recipe to strengthen hair. Mine is older and thinner (and dyed) and it's looking great.I will, no doubt, buy this product when I run out. Love this one!"
160,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Using both shampoo and conditioner, I have softer hair with very little hair loss.","I use this shampoo along with its accompanying conditioner.My hair is permed into coils, and combing through it always produces a wad of hair for me to dispose of.Combing my hair while wet after using this product still requires some tugging, but there is little to no hair in the comb when I am finished.This has been true from the first time I used this shampoo and conditioner, and is quite a different story than is true with other shampoos I have used.I have always used a comb rather than a brush because I like my hair to feel completely tangle-free, so every hair gets the once over.When I comb my hair in the evening, once again: very few hairs get caught in my comb.On top of that, my hair has never been softer."
161,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife has long hair and found this very nice. She isn't a huge fan of the smell, but it isn't very strong. She says it leaves her hair soft and tangle-free. While she likes it, she's doesn't think we will buy more at the current price. She thinks the Pantene she normally uses does as good a job. The sulfate-free is nice, but now the Pantene truly natural is Sulfate free. It's nice to trust small companies that really care, but I don't know this company well enough to feel a connection. My wife does like it so we still give it 4 stars. If you don't mind the price, it does seem to be a good product."
162,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,She has hair like mine but hers has been through chemo and is ...,"My mother bought this product for us and suggested that I try it out on my hair before she used it on hers. She has hair like mine but hers has been through chemo and is very susceptible to harsh products. My hair is thick and curly/kinky and somewhat course but it is also color treated and gets blow dried a lot to control it. I have used WEN which I like almost as much as my hair loves Pantene so I had a pretty good comparison to what this product would do. First off, I used the shampoo (1 application only) and it immediately stripped my hair of everything down to the cuticle and left it rough and dry. I found this shocking in a sulfate free shampoo so I assumed that maybe the conditioner would replace what was taken. It didn't. After waiting five minutes, it rinsed right out and left my hair roughened and abused and knotted. I did see barely any breakage so that much is true, right up to the point where I had to actually comb through the tangles this stuff left my hair with. Then the breakage tripled. I had to pump a significant amount of the leave in conditioner into my hair to work through the knots and even then my hair still felt rough and terrible. I managed to seal the cuticle during blow drying on the lowest setting but all that leave in conditioner made my hair feel gummy and all the shine was gone. I can't wait to wash my hair again just to get rid of the results. Would never recommend this product to anyone and informed my mother not to even try it fearing what it would do to her already fragile hair. This stuff is going back immediately."
163,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazed by this product,"I recently purchased this shampoo in a set with conditioner and the repairing Monoi oil from another website.  I wasn't able to write a review there- but couldn't wait to tell people what a great product this is.  In the demonstration and on the bottle, it claims 92% less breakage after the very first use.  I really didn't beleive that.. figured they were exagerating to sell more shampoo- but decided to give it a try anyway.  In the last few weeks, I have literally had so much breakage that I feared my hair was falling out.  In the shower, my hand would swipe over the hair and come away with actual globs of hair.  I began worrying that I might have some sort of health issue.  I just used this shampoo/conditioner set for the first time- and I cannot believe the difference.  While it wasn't a zero-breakage situation, I was amazed to find only a few strands of hair in my hand.. FAR less than the clumps that had been happening.  The difference was dramatic- and I am thrilled beyond words.  I've spent way more money on ""designer-y"" products that haven't delivered the way this one does.  It smells lovely too- but with how well it worked, I almost wouln't have cared if it smelled terrible.. it would still be worth it.If you have breakage- I would say what do you have to lose?  Give it a try- it's excellent stuff!"
164,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,5 stars is not nearly enough....,"I don't give out five stars unless a product is pretty flawless; it has to meet or exceed its product claims, be fairly priced for what it claims to do, and have no obvious tweaks needed to make it better. This trifecta of excellence is rarer than you think but with this shampoo and its sister conditioner my hair has finally met its perfect match ....My hair: I am 42 years old, biracial with very curly, slightly/kinky hair. It is fine textured, light to medium density, and breaks VERY, VERY easily. My hair is not chemically processed so I occasionally use a flat iron or curling iron for styling. Mostly I wear a medium length afro style these days with 

Jane Carter Solution Wrap and Roll, 8.5 Ounce

   as a styling aid to define the curls. Over the years I have used exclusive salon products like Ouidad, drug store brands, high end department store brands like Fekkai, earthy brands like Ojon, and just about everything in between. The results always left me searching for something that would help my hair feel and look healthy and strong. With all the trial and error I never found any one or two products that worked well enough to satisfy my needs. I can't comment as to how the shampoo works alone since I have used the conditioner as well from day one, but as far as my experience using both products I'd say that Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo and Conditioner produced results better than anything else I've ever tried.After the first shampoo and conditioner treatment I proceeded to comb through my hair while it was still wet, a task that usually involves a considerable amount of pulling and results in the inevitable huge hair ball that winds up tangled on the comb. With the Carol's Daughter Monoi products the amount of hairs on the comb was only about a quarter of what was usually shed with my former shampoo and conditioner. Suffice to say I was floored.....""92% reduction in breakage"" printed right there on the label is a pretty big claim to make and I was *very* skeptical of such a bold statement. I would have had no qualms about requesting refund if this product fell short of my expectations but this shampoo along with the conditioner delivers on its claims. With the first use I had about 75% less breakage than with my former products and the results have remained steady over six months of use. I waited to post this review because I wanted to see if I would need to switch products either due to the seasons changing or to see if buildup would happen or if the results would taper off; I've seen consistently EXCELLENT results over the months and for the first time ever as far as shampoos and conditioners goes I feel I have FINALLY found ""the one""!The scent of both the shampoo and conditioner is fabulous; leaves a light scent on the hair.Does not leave weight or residue on my hair with either the shampoo or conditioner which is VERY important since my hair is fine.For what seems like forever my hair was constantly the same length due to breakage but in the months since switching to Carol's Daughter I've gained over an inch of length.My hair is soft and manageable.Expensive but worth it and that's something I say very RARELY.Easily, happily and 100% recommended!"
165,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good for my hair,This shampoo smells amazing and it makes my hair feel wonderfully soft and it smooths down my sometimes frizzy long hair very well.

166,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves my hair soft and manageable,"This shampoo has a gardenia fragrance, and even though it is sulfate-free, it lathers very well. I always worry that moisturizing shampoos and conditioners will leave my hair too oily or will weigh my fine textured, flyaway hair down. This didn’t do that. It left my hair soft and easy to manage. It seemed to have a little more bounce to it. I’m 68 and my hair is drier than it used to be, so this shampoo is helpful. And it smells really nice."

I have natural curly hair and this does a great job of cleaning and softening without having to use a follow up conditioner. Has a pleasant almond like scent during shower but not after, no lingering scent. Reminds me of Baobab oil shampoo. I would get this again."

Anything that can help strengthen my hair is worth trying!  I was really pleased with Carol’s Daughter Monoi Shampoo.The shampoo has a pleasant fragrance that seemed a bit strong when I first opened the bottle, but it was hardly noticeable after my shower.  It left my hair feeling clean, even though it doesn’t lather much.When I was combing my hair after the shower, I was pleased by how soft and silky my hair felt.  As it air-dried, I was pleased to see that my hair wasn’t frizzing nearly as much as usual.I’ve already added the shampoo and its matching conditioner to my shopping cart, to be purchased when my current supply runs out.

Honestly, it is comparable to Oribe for half the price."
173,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst sulfate shampoo ever used,"I'm 100% black with thick and curly soft 3c/4a natural hair, and this shampoo is the worst sulfate- free shampoo I've ever used! The smell is amazing but it left my hair feeling so dry, brittle and stiff. It left a residue feeling after washing it out and although the bottle says detangling, I suggest no one ever think about detangling with this stuff. It would be impossible.  My hair was tangled and finger combing was out of the question. It lathers up and it is very stripping. But if you must try this, I would recommend using a little shampoo and A LOT and I mean A LOT of the monoi conditioner, to bring back everything the shampoo took away.I wouldn't recommend this shampoo to anyone."

177,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good but not good for my hair.,I really love the smell and I wish it worked for me. The shampoo is thick and a little goes a long way...unfortunately the conditioner made my hair feel very dirty. It just doesn't clean very well. It's a shame because it smells so good (like coppertone to me). I do have fine hair so maybe just not good for fine straight hair.
178,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just like a pantene commercial!!!,"To start with, I am caucasian with colored,oily,long, wavy/curly hair and have been searching for a great shampoo and conditioner for 3 years.  I moved to Florida where the water is very hard and after a year of living there my hair was fried.  I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I went to my friend google and discovered it was the water.  I rented a water softener and have been searching ever since for a way to fix my damaged hair.  It was so bad, I couldn't brush it, wet or dry, full of conditioner, it was frizzy and nasty.  I wanted to chop it all off.  I've tried a lot of shampoo's and conditioners since then, and have been somewhat happy with the results.  I am also trying to get to the point where I wash my hair every other day, but it is quite oily and generally looks very dirty on the second day.  I have since moved again, and now lack a water softener and again have hard water.  I found Aphogee Keratin 2 minute reconstructor and have been using it once a week for several months with great results.  It gets rid of the heavy metals that collect in my hair.  But I still needed to repair the damaged hair, the Aphogee removes metals and prevents decline, but couldn't do enough to improve my hair.  Recently I bought the Monoi Repairing 3-peice starter kit which contains the Repairing Sulfate Free Shampoo, the Repairing Conditioner and the Repairing Hair Mask.  I used it for over a week, about 5 applications.  I loved the smell of it, I had noticeable bounce, but wasn't thrilled with the conditioner.  I have long curly hair, and I just couldn't get a brush through it after I used it.  I was afraid I was breaking more hair off with the brush and so I gave it all to my neighbor and moved on to my next shampoo/conditioner.  After a week of not using the Carol's Daughter however, I noticed a decline.  Hmm.  Maybe it was working, I just needed a different conditioner. Conditioners are my biggest problem, either it is slick and I can brush it, then it is heavy and weighed down or it rinses out completely and I'm stuck with a tangled mess.  So I bought the full bottle of the Repairing Sulfate Free Shampoo and the Rosemary Mint Clarifying Conditioner.  I've been using it for 2 weeks now.  The results are amazing!!!  I can easily go two days without washing my hair.  The Rosemary conditioner feels so good, it's kinda tingly and the smell is amazing!!  I still use the Aphogee and I use the mask (I kept that, didn't give it to my neighbor) once a week but a different day than the Aphogee.  My hair looks like those Pantene commercials, like one of those women who you don't think really exist.  My three  year old is petting my hair.  My hair dresser (got it colored last week) even commented how much softer it is.  My hair has never looked this good, never in my life.  I have wanted this hair, but never thought I could have these results, especially this quickly!!!  I can't wait to see how it is after 6 months of using these products.  I am thrilled with these products, and hope you have the same results!!!!Forgive me, but I plan to copy and paste this review onto the other Carol's Daughter products mentioned in this review :)"
179,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!,"I have thick, course hair that is damaged/dry ends (due to ombre style). Most issues I have with ""No-Sulfate"" shampoos is that it doesn't get my thick hair clean (It can get very oily after a day or two). My hair feels clean and smells great.I usually alternate between Bumble and Bumble, Enjoy, and Bed Head. Those never quite got my hair frizz-free or rid of the fly-aways.I have to say this stuff is amazing, it sealed down all my ""fly-away"" hairs, and my hair feels very smooth and I see no frizz. My bangs are usually all over the place, but after using this they're clean, silky, and not all frizzy-fried looking!"
180,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Eh just OK,"I am almost finished with the shampoo and conditioner after almost 1 month of using it. I am in mid-40's, with fine hair which tends to get frizzy susceptible to humidity.  I long for long hair like when I was in my 30's.  I've even started taken a Biotin supplement along with this shampoo & conditioner line with hopes of seeing some improvement (especially after my hair stylists chopped off more length than I asked for about a month ago!  UGH but I guess she had a right to cut a lot off as my ends were tattered from breakage).  So, I thought I'd see what I could do about it by buying this line (and the supplements).  First, the packaging was disappointing and difficult to open, I was frustrated.  Second, I noticed the smell, its not bad or terrible, just not my favorite I noticed it had a bit of a coconut scent and I'm not into coconut scented anything it smells like a sunscreen a little bit, not the way I want my hair to smell.  Then, the first two times I used it I noticed a couple of hair strands came out right before I was about to style my hair.  I blew dried my hair (it has been a heat wave on the East Coast, high humidity, but my house is air conditioned) and I couldn't believe that my hair started to frizz underneath before I even walked out the door, another disappointment.  After continually using it and giving it a chance, I noticed less breakage (unlike the first couple of times I used it) but it isn't a good shampoo line for my easily humid prone hair, whereas there are other shampoos on the market that have done better in keeping the frizz at a minimum.  I wanted to like this shampoo but I don't think I'm giving it another chance.  Also, I noticed my hair wasn't as vibrant as I had thought it would be after using it.  I will go back to Kerastase (which is very expensive and I'm not sure I just spelled it correctly), or Aveeda products."

What a nightmare! The BlondeMe bleach really destroys healthy hair quickly. I bought this Repairing shampoo and the accompanying conditioner from Carol's Daughter last week, and have used it twice. The first problem is the obnoxious smell (smells like Glade bathroom freshener in a fake Hibiscus scent). Not only can I not stand the smell, but people I work with have commented on the overpowering stink. The real ""outcomes"" from using this shampoo are specific to the manufacturer's claim that you will notice fuller hair and 98% less breakage after ONE USE. Not even close. Please do not waste your money on this product line (including the worthless Reparing conditioner). You'll also be doing everyone with a nose a favor too."

Since I am impatient, I use the mask without a plastic cap, for only about 10 minutes in the hot shower.Can't believe how easy comb-out is. Dried hair (air dry or blow dry) is silky, soft, shiny, and no frizz, even in high humidity. What more could you want? I'm not crazy for the scent, but it's grown on me. Can't tell if it's helped with breakage - that's ONE problem I don't have. Give it a try - maybe you'll like it as much as I do!"

I don't make my own products any longer and my hair was suffering from the unnatural effects of store-bought shampoo and conditioner....that is until I found Carol's Daughter Shampoo and Condition.  I've only bought the shampoo so far but I've already noticed a difference in the look and feel of my hair and the decreased ""fall-out"" I've been suffering from.  My next purchase will be the conditioner."
202,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as as advertised,"This product prevents ends from splitting and keeps hair looking good. It smells good, lasts a long time because it is thick and a little goes a long way. It doesn’t take away frizzy hair or leave a high shine but it’s better than what stores carry and reasonably priced."
203,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like Hawaii,"I have thick, but fine, long hair.

205,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite,This is my favorite.

It is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. My hair easily gets dry and frizzy with any change in weather. Manoi has counteracted this problem.

222,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Shampoo for dry-color treated hair,"I wasn't sure about this shampoo since I had tried Wen previously and didn't like how that product left my hair feeling and smelling (it smelled like the old-time face cleaner Noxzema). Anyway, when I saw it featured on a home shopping channel and decided to give it a try. Since I didn't want an 80oz container I purchased this smaller version from Amazon. First, my hair is about 70% grey, shoulder length and colored. With regular shampoo's my color would was out in about two weeks but with Carol's Daughter Monoi the color lasts about three weeks longer and smells great.Since my hair is dry I do not wash my hair every day and it still looks fresh and clean until the next washing, not greasy or weighed down by the shampoo. I use the conditioner also and although it has the same great scent it doesn't really help with tangles and I normally have to use a leave in conditioner afterward to be able to comb my hair."
223,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"Love her products!  The shampoo and conditioner have really improved my hair.  Less breakage, faster growth, and just easier to deal with."

253,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it, I can see a difference in hair","I like it , I can see a difference in hair breakage"
254,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!!,Growing up I have always had oily hair.  I had to wash my hair daily so that it did not look dirty.  I have used everything from Paul Mitchell to grocery store brands.  Going through shampoo like crazy.  My sister started using sulfate free shampoo. She commented that her hair felt so clean.  I received a sample of Carol's Daughter Monoi during a beauty event for Macy's.  I love this.  It smells so good.  My hair stays clean and soft.  I now only wash my hair every 2 to 3 days.  It takes me a lot longer to go through shampoo now.  So I count this as a big savings.
255,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,I will keep looking for the perfect shampoo,I am 49 years old and color treat my hair every 2-3 months; mostly low lights and very few highlights. I have oily hair but summer and color processing left my hair stiff and with a great deal of breakage. I purchased this shampoo and the Monoi Repairing Condition hoping to restore shine and improve the condition of my hair.After almost three months of use it has not improved the dullness of my hair and I continue to have breakage even after minimizing the use of my flat iron. It has helped a little with improving the elasticity of my hair. The only other product I have used on my hair after washing is a thermal protectant. I feel the shampoo and conditioner actually weigh my hair down too much. I feel the need to wash every day which only makes the scalp produce more oil.This product combination did not work well for me but may work better on normal/dry hair. I will use what is left but will not be purchasing replacement product. The scent is pleasant and it does a decent job of leaving wet hair manageable enough to comb out without too much pulling.
256,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"Lots of lather, smells nice, cleans hair and washes out without leaving hair and scalp feeling dry, brittle and stripped of all it's natural oils."

262,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hair care product,This particular shampoo is very good. It doesn't strip the hair or leave a film. Diffenently lived up to its potential less breakage was true.  Also leaves a wonderful fresh smell to the hair.

It makes my hair look like it had a salon blowout without even trying
276,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff,"It makes my hair soft and easy to blow out, my hair is thin,curly and dry plus frizzy when the weather acts up. So far the frizz has not been to bad.  I do have to add that it works well with wen . I use the wen as a leave in before I blow out my hair."
277,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"Got it for my ex, she loves it"
278,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"The Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate Free Shampoo is an absolutely lovely scented shampoo.  The shampoo washes very effectively - almost too effectively actually - and leaves hair literally squeaky clean.  This is a shampoo you will need to use with a conditioner as it cleans so much that hair feels almost stripped of all oils and coatings.  I don't particularly like having my hair stripped that clean, but for those with very oily hair, this may be a good shampoo for you.  I have hair that ranges more between the dry/normal side, and because I have Asian hair, my hair is a bit more porous -  the shampoo just makes it too dry feeling after use.  After conditioning, hair feels much more smooth, soft, and will detangle easily - by itself, it will not.  In terms of scent, this shampoo is awesome.  The scent is subtle and slightly floral, and just smells pleasant overall.  This shampoo by itself isn't my favorite, but when used in conjunction with a good conditioner, it works fairly well."
279,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,wonderful shampoo for color-treated hair,"This is more expensive than the shampoos I usually use, but I'd heard good things about it. Turns out, I really like it.The first thing I noticed was that the consistency is very nice. It was thick, but not too thick -- I could still spread it around and work it through my roots easily. Plus, it lathers wonderfully for something sulfate-free. So if you've wanted to use a sulfate-free shampoo but were worried about poor lathering, worry no more -- this could be just what you're looking for.I feel this does a good job of getting my hair clean. I love that it's free of a lot of harmful ingredients and that it's safe for color-treated hair. I've been using this for a couple of weeks now, and my color has not faded. My hair is actually quite shiny and soft, even though I shampoo every day.It's difficult to describe the scent, although I find it pleasant. There's a hint of coconut to it, a small hint of floral something or other, and a little bit of a powdery scent. It's a pretty strong scent, though, so if you can sniff some of this in a store before purchase, that might be a good idea -- because it stays with you, so it's best if you like it!"
280,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Generally good, a bit more monoi would be nice","I found that this shampoo lathered quite well for a sulfate-free shampoo.  Sometimes you get no lather at all from sulfate-free shampoos, but this one gives foam.  I do find that you need to use a bit more than a shampoo with sulfates, which is pretty normal for when you go sulfate-free.  When you first squeeze this shampoo out and put it on your head it smells fairly strongly of soap.  I didn't really smell the monoi until I really got the shampoo lathered up.  I wish it smelled more strongly of monoi- the strong soap note remains.  In terms of efficacy- it cleaned by hair well, and left it soft.  Can't ask for more than that."
281,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This says that you'll see results pretty quickly, and I have been using it with the conditioner. The Monoi shampoo has a nice, natural scent that doesn't seem to linger in my hair and lathers up well (not overly much), though I'm not a big fan of the cap (either screw off all the way or not, the pull up and dispense is a bit of a pain). I seem to have less breakage after a few uses (I've had bleaching on the end and I color, trying to use less heat on my hair as a result), but no noticeably less hair loss. Still my hair hasn't changed for the worse while using it, so I'll continue with the bottle to see if it split ends improve (lessen) and I'm happy with the fact that it's sulfate free."
282,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems to do the job, but the squeaky clean texture worries me.","This is a really nice shampoo in some ways, and not in others.  I have been wanting to try a sulfate-free shampoo for a while. This has a lovely beachy scent to it, so nice that I almost lathered a second time.  However, because my hair felt stripped and weak after the first rinse, I didn't do a second lathering.  After air-drying it feels clean, although not as thick as my hair usually does.  The individual strands feel fine and flyaway (and I've always considered myself to have thick, coarse hair).  Will probably save this bottle for emergency ""hey, I'm all out of shampoo"" situations, and continue using either my Sebastian or Oribe for everyday."
283,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the most amazing shampoo I have ever used and after trying it ...,"This is the most amazing shampoo I have ever used and after trying it I have switched to all Carol’s daughter products for my hair. I have thin curls, which tend to get frizzy. This line has restored vitality to my hair and you can feel it after just one use. It even smells incredible. I now use the Monoi leave in spray as a refresher for my second and third day hair. I even gave out this line to all the women on my fam for Christmas and they loved it, too. My sis in law, who is a hairdresser, said I always know all the good products."
284,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This shampoo came well packaged. The scent of it was pleasant and kind of coconut-like. When I lathered this shampoo on my hair, I thought it was kind of thick in terms of texture. That's fine, but it just takes a little extra effort to lather it on in comparison to liquid shampoo. In terms of my hair after using this shampoo, it's still too early to tell but it does seem to have a good effect on my hair, which seems a bit fuller. Overall, seems like a nice shampoo."
285,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Sulfate Free Shampoo,"This is a good shampoo!  It cleaned my hair and it felt moisturizing, fresh, and  soft while I was shampooing. It never did feel tight or dried out.  I was amazed that I had less breakage. I have relaxed hair and I had quite a bit or new growth when I shampooed, but it did not break as much as  it usually does when I wash it with other shampoos.  My hair is curly and it tangles easily but, my hair did not get that tangled when I used this shampoo.  The smell is nice, but I did have to use quite a bit of the shampoo. The bottle is kind of small.  I wish the shampoo came in a bigger bottle. I used the conditioner and it detangled my hair just fine.  My hair dried soft.  I did have some frizz, but I air dried my hair.  Overall this is a good shampoo to use!"
286,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,NO MORE BREAKAGE!,"I got the Monoi shampoo and conditioner as a free sample, when I placed an order for other Carols daughter products. I am 100% natural, no relaxer, no color. My hair is very dry, and thick. The shampoo made my hair tangle a lot. The conditioner did not make it feel as tangle free as I would have liked. I may try the mask or use the Paul Mitchell detangler with my next wash.My hair had extreme breakage before using this shampoo and conditioner. EXTREME breakage, when I would blow it out my hair would be all in the sink and bathroom floor. This product stopped my breakage in away you would have too see for yourself. I will use this product for the rest of my life, and tell all my family and friends about it. This was unreal. I cannot believe that this actually did STOP my extreme breakage. I am so happy and grateful this product exist. I have used high end Mazani, Alter Ego, Paul Mitchell... etc, and NOTHING can compare to this. If you have breakage this is for you!"

It smells great and leaves my hair clean, shiny and looking amazing! I usually just wash my hair with Shikikai soap to promote growth and not use chemicals but every now and then I treat my hair to Carols Daughter Monoi shampoo. It smells great, works perfectly and the price for what you get really cannot be beat. I am just very impressed."
290,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This shampoo lathers well and rinses quickly.  There is no noticeable aroma.  My hair felt soft after using it.  The best part, for me, is the lid:  Just twist it and a hole appears, so you can squeeze the shampoo out and if it falls over, it won't leak much.  Recommended."
291,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not use!!!!,"The first time i used this shampoo it left my soft hair feeling rough, dry and like sandpaper. I used it again thinking I didn't use it right, but got the exact same results. I had gotten the 3 piece kit with this horrible sulfate free shampoo, the conditioner, and the hair masque. The conditioners were great, but I am so glad I got the sample sized shampoo because I'd be REALLY mad if I bought a big bottle of that crap."
292,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Used this with the corresponding mask and strengthening oil. I liked using a sulfate free shampoo. It smells bad, but it got my hair clean. Even though I followed this with the mask and the oil, my hair is dry today."
293,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has a nice, pleasant mild scent. It cleans the hair well, conditions and repairs the hair. Other selling features - No sulfates, parabens, petroleum, mineral oil or artificial colors."
294,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific Item!!!,"I have been using items from Carol's Daughter for the past 2 years.My hair is (typical) Irish red, with a little gray, and this shampoo works wonders!It does a great job cleaning hair, removes all frizz, and prevents hair from getting cloggd in drains.It can be purchased on the Web, but not at this price and with free shipping. I urge you to give it a try. You will be very pleased.It's my very favourite and i highly recommend buying it from seller at Amazon."
295,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Made my Scalp ITCH Like Crazy,"I purchased the CD Monoi Shampoo & Conditioner at the same time.  One or both immediately caused my scalp to itch to the point where I had to shampoo a few times with my previous shampoo to reduce the itching.  Also, my hair felt very dry afterward, and my comb didn't go through my hair smoothly after conditioning.  'Back to WEN I go."
296,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite shampoo of all time. The scent is devine -- and I mean OMG this shampoo smells soooo good! BUT scent is just not enough for the discerning consumer nowadays -- I needed it to WORK. It completely delivered.My hair was clean and not stripped -- not tangly, straggly, or crunchy after the shampooing. I never use it on its own since I always use conditioner so I haven't tried it by itself-- but as part of the duo its fabulous!The first time I used it I shed more hair. That got me a little worried. I tried it again and have been using it for a while now and, after that initial shed, I have notice a dramatic decrease in my shedding! My hair is baby fine, very thin, and just below chin length. Overall my hair is normal with a tendency to an oily scalp. This shampoo does a phenomenal job on my hair! It has a very good amount of lather for a sulfate free shampoo (many of them do not lather at all), is easy to spread through my hair, and does not require scrubbing as if I'm cleaning my pots and pans to get my scalp clean.I do have a few caveats for you: If your hair is very thick (my daughter) you will use a fair bit of this stuff to shampoo. Also if your hair is prone to tangling like crazy (my daughter again) this did not help that -- it didn't make it worse but it didn't make it better. I think this shampoo is best for fine hair that is thin to medium (not overly thick) that tends to be normal or perhaps normal to oily. My daughter (in addition to the above) has exceptionally dry hair and this is not a shampoo we'd use on her on a regular basis. She doesn't have breakage or shedding issues either which this is designed to fix.I love this stuff!"

301,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible products! I want a refund!!!!,Did not help my hair at all. Definitely would not buy again. I wish I could get a refund. I spent over $100 on these Carol's Daughter products. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
302,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Something is Off,I have used this product forever.  This time I bought it from Amazon as opposed to buying it from the manufacturer.  Something is off - the product color is different and the smell is different.  Leading me to conclude that either the manufacturer has changed it or this is not a legitimate product.  Not happy and will order directly from now on.
303,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter's and I love the smell of this shampoo.,I bought quite a few bottles of the shampoo during the holidays when they were on sale. The price was worth it. Now they're just too expensive. Definitely have to wait till they're on sale again.
304,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Sulfate-free Shampoo, 8.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,TOO SMELLY!!,"Opened it for the first time and wow the scent is wonderful....until it never. Went. Away!! TWO DAYS later, the scent is still so strong! It’s giving me a headache, I’m embarrassed to go out shopping because people act like I poured perfume all over my body, my husband is annoyed... it’s really bad. Look at the ingredients lists. The conditioner has PERFUME (aka toxic fragrance) as the 4th or 5th ingredient. This is not a safer or less toxic product but I thought if it worked I would look past that. Nope, definitely not worth it!Also, my hair does NOT break less and using both the shampoo and conditioner makes the ends of my hair staticky and the roots get oily. Not impressed and extremely disappointed considering how very expensive this is!"

0,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best conditioner I’ve used,"My hair is very fine and brittle. I was getting a little sad thinking that I wouldn’t be able to have long hair because of how brittle it has become as I got older (I used to have long, thicker hair as a child but as I went into my 20s it thinned our from stress and stuff).  This stuff is amazing, even after the first use it blew me away with how soft my hair became. It’s now been over two weeks of use and I have to say this conditioner has made me love my hair again. For those skeptics, I was not paid or given a free bottle. My mom bought it and showed me, and I felt the need to hop on her amazon and review it."
1,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my 3c/4a natural curls,"I have african hair. I've tried almost every product natural curlies recommend and this is really the only one that works for  me (even if it's technically not CG friendly). Yes, this product does have silicone, but silicones are pretty much like a plastic you coat your hair with so it slips and slides and untangles more easily. Most curlies would say this is a bad thing, but considering how healthy my hair looks, how soft it is, how tight and frizzless my curls are, I say whatever!  I use ""low poo"" so for every 3 or 4 times I cowash only, I'll do a bit of shampoo to get the build up off, and I use the accompanying shampoo to this product. I absolutely swear by this conditioner and I have it on subscription because I cannot live without it! Too bad they're so hard to find in stores now!"
2,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,3c / 4a Very High Porosity With S pattern curls,"I have a very odd hair type and I haven’t been this loyal to a conditioner since the relaxer days. It is the only product on my subscribe and save!  I really need this!  Can’t recall this much slip in years.  A must for natural hair.  In the pic, I washed, used THIS conditioner, and styled with Carols daughter Hair milk and a little of the Dudleys PCA moisture retainer. When it dries it will hold my curls together. So much better than using gels for the wash and go."
3,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible fragrance, left my curls breaking and like straw","I used the shampoo and conditioner, both of which have such a terrible fragrance that I almost stopped and re-washed with my husband's shampoo/conditioner. This product smells something like overpowering, cheap baby-powder perfume and 4-day unwashed scalp. It is gaggingly cloying and sweet. I have never been so revolted. And the scent lingers even after a few days, even after I tried washing with my husband's product.The shampoo... well, it did clean. It completely stripped everything from my hair, including all of the moisture. So much so that I could barely get my hands through my hair to distribute the conditioner which barely contributed anything to my hair except a greasy feeling that I couldn't wait to rinse out.It left my soft curls brittle, like dry straw. I'm still trying to repair the damage that was done by one wash."
4,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Miracle? Nah, but my hair is soft now","My hair has been bleached, toned, and dyed to oblivion. I used to have soft, but tangle-prone loose curls, but after one bad bleach job, it never recovered. Frizzed out, tangled constantly, and in general unappealing, my hair has been through tons of treatments and conditioners. After just one wash using this conditioner, my hair hasn't been this soft in years. It is still frizzy, and still gets tangled, as this isn't a miracle product, but I can actually run my hand through it without feeling like I'm touching hay. Carol's Daughter has some great stuff, but this is the first that's truly landed home for me. Unfortunately though, the almond scent is not my favorite, haha"
5,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Odd smell, but soft hair in exchange","I was looking for a cheap alternative for an almond based conditioner, because my hair has gone through bleach and coloring. My hair is naturally pin straight, but tons of breakage because of how fine/thin it naturally is as well. Even though the smell is not the greatest, it actually fades after my hair dries, and I usually spray a little bit of leave-in-conditioner afterwards which masks the smell anyways. I would only say buy this if you are looking to repair damaged and thin hair for a cheaper price, but if you cannot stand a weird smell, then don't buy it."
6,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Softens Hair w/o Drying Out,"My hair has been flourishing tremendously since using this product.  Packaged properly, so that product stayed secure while in route.  Not a heavy product.  I have natural hair, which I recently chopped off.  My wash day process includes 1. using the conditioner as sort of a detangler, prior to washing my hair 2. Shampoo w/ product in the same family or apple cider vinegar rinse (with essential oil--rosemary) 3. Add more conditioner, after shampooing or cider rinse....leave in with cap 5 to 10 minutes 4. Rinse, use a small amount of leave-in moisturizer (Carol's Daughter's Hair Milk) or something similar 5. Style and go"
7,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Product is nice but bottle wasn’t full.,I wish I would’ve taken a picture when I first got it because the bottle wasn’t completely full. Doesn’t seem like it spilled in transit just as if it wasn’t full in the first place. The pump is abnormally large but.. I guess that’s not a huge deal. Product itself smells amazing and definitely moisturizes.
8,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Never Going Back!,"I was using products that caused my hair to fall out.  I bought the whole system...shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner (as will as hair mild and hair pudding).  Since using these products, my hair is softer and it is growing back! I won't using any other products on my hair!"
9,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing is the scent!,This conditioner isn’t special in any way. It isn’t the best at conditioning and definitely isn’t chemical free. The only thing that is appealing about this stuff is the incredible fragrance.
10,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Transformed and Defined My Natural Curly Texture,"This is the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair is naturally in loose curls and is quite thick. It’s the type of hair that tangles sitting still. I also do not blow dry, straighten, or heat treat in any way and it has never been colored. I have been unhappy with my texture lately. It seemed limp and lackluster and my curls were undefined and there were less than usual. I started using Carroll’s Daughter and within only a couple uses, my texture was transformed back to it’s normal state. My curls are far more defined and the natural oils are no longer being stripped. I have way more volume too. It has truly surpassed my expectations. I can’t imagine buying another brand now that I’ve tried this one."
11,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and leaves hair nice and soft and smooth,"Love the almond scent, and really like the thickness of this conditioner. I use a comb in the shower to make sure the conditioner is evenly distributed. Then I leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it out. For the price, this is a great conditioner, especially if you have thick, course hair."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dry Hair Scare,As a long time Carol’s Daughter user the Black Vanilla Moisturizing Conditioner I thought I’d give this version a try. This line of conditioner and shampoo didn’t work for my hair. The product left my hair dry and dull looking.
13,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for a daily or twice a week refresher wash,"LOVE this product. Usually conditioners leave my hair greasy once dried, or by day 2 my curls (2c/3a) are flat and dull. This conditioner is very moisturizing and works great for my 2 time a week wash. Haven't tried it as a co wash but it is light enough to use it. Definitely also recommend both the shampoo and the deep conditioning mask in this line as well. The scent is lovely and I don't notice it being too overpowering once dried."
14,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST conditioner for curly hair!,"I get this conditioner for my daughter who has thick curly hair. It not only smells AMAZING, but it definitely works very well for her hair (even my hair which is more thick and wavy). I love the pump style bottle too which makes hair washing much easier. Just wish more came in the bottle for the price, but otherwise a really great brand and product."
15,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very strong almond scent,"It's a decent conditioner, but the almond scent is overwhelming.

32,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,PSA - Too much protein will kill your hair. This product caused severe damage to my hair.,"This will wreck your hair. I wash and condition only once or twice a week and because of the amount of protein in this shampoo and conditioner (which is not clearly marked on the bottle) my healthy-ish hair went to complete rubbish. Keratin and protein should only be used every once in a blue moon on hair, not on a regular basis. A protein overload will cause extreme damage. I just had to cut my hair to correct the damage that this product caused. This might work for African American hair IF they only wash every 4-6 weeks or less, but if you just have coarse, curly Caucasian hair like me, this will absolutely ruin it."

83,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this conditioner! And smells heavenly!,"I have a confession to make. It's a dry, scaly, scalp. I have tried every treatment out there from dandruff shampoo, to tar and coal based shampoos. From perfumed shampoos, to stinky stuff. From conditioners that are left in and those that are rinsed off, to oils and rinses. Nothing has cured my ails.Well, sorry, neither has this one! (Betcha thought I was going to say this one has cured me! Ha ha) I wish I could. I really do! Because this stuff left my hair so fabulous feeling!!! I mean really!Okay, so maybe I am comparing apples to oranges here (heck, who are we kidding? I know I am!) Conditioner is not meant to be a scalp treatment, but rather a hair treatment. Now am I right, or am I right? Of course it is. And Carols Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner  does just that! It restores natural luster and shine to your hair. And I have very white, 50-something, wiry hair. It is very thick. And very hard to get to look soft and shining. I do not color my hair because I don't like how it feels. But this, well, it brought back luster to my hair that I had been missing for a long time. I simply use a small amount each time I wash my hair, and it makes my hair shine! It also does something I was totally amazed to find it do. It took the fading yellow out of my hair! If you've ever seen someone with white hair, you may have noticed that sometimes it turns a yellowy-looking color. I don't know if that's something environmental, or pigment trying to return, or what. (I'm sure there's a logical explanation for that yellowy look.) I'm not sure. But I know it makes it look dingy. Something someone who works in the public eye doesn't like to see! This conditioner allows my white to shine! And for me, that sold me on the product!So I highly recommend Carols Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner, and I give it five stars,and a big thumbs up!You can find Carols Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner  on Amazon it retails for $11.37 for a 12-fluid ounce bottle. And it comes with a convenient pump bottle."
84,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is very excellent conditioner.  My hair is ""slightly"" damaged from highlighting, meaning it gets tangled easily especially when wet. I don't like to comb it when it is tangled because it breaks. I try to treat my hair gently. This conditioner works great for me. My hair untangles in the shower, and it becomes smooth and comb-able.The product is thick and creamy. It has a luxurious feel. It expands with water to fill up your hair, and then rinses out cleanly.  It isn't slimy, and it doesn't leave a film on your neck.I think the conditioner smells very nice.  It has a kind of old-fashioned smell. I don't know if I am smelling the almonds in the almond milk, or if it is all added fragrance, but it does smell good, and not like chemicals.My hair handles great after using this product. It is easy to comb out and dry and style. After drying, it feels soft and full. It doesn't feel dirty at the end of the day, like with some other products.In general, I like to mix up conditioners. I don't stick to a single brand for very long, because I find the ingredients build up in my hair over time. So I will buy different brands and alternate them. I really like the Carols Daughter conditioner, so this one will go in my regular rotation."
85,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Fragerance, Shine, and Volume","My wife really loves the smell of this -- she loves to inhale deep when near my hair.  The fragrance is what some might consider feminine.  It reminds me of a mix between baby powder and a flowery lotion mixed together.  As long as my wife likes it, I don't mind my hair smelling a little baby powder.  The conditioner also produces a nice shine on my hair once my hair is dry and the volume looks improved too.  Further, my hair lays well and there is little frizz.  The pump is nice as it is designed in a way that water will not likely get back into the bottle.  You'd be surprised how often I've had this problem with flip-style lids.  Ingredient list uses a very small font which is frustrating given there was plenty of more room on the bottle in case they switched to a larger font.  The bottle slightly leaked upon delivery, but as I am in Arizona, the summer heat may have had a role in this."

87,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Horrible!,"I can't tell you if this product works because I had to wash it out almost immediately to get the horrible smell out of my hair. I thought the smell would fade as my hair dried, but it was just as bad as when I was putting it on my hair. Before my hair was even dry, I washed it again two more times with two different shampoos, and still couldn't get the smell out, but at least it had faded a bit. I lived with it for two days, and washed my hair again. It took one more wash after that to get the smell out completely. I had to put the towel that I had used initially out in the garage until I could wash it, and I put the shampoo bottle outside until garbage day, at which time, I threw it in the truck myself."

Their website seems to be targeted toward a certain ethnicity.I have fine, naturally curly, Caucasian hair which isn’t really over-processed but I’m willing to try any product which might be an improvement.The conditioner has a subtle fragrance and left my hair easy to manage, just about what you’d expect from a conditioner.After being impressed by other Carol’s daughter products I was surprised that this conditioner was sort of mediocre. Nothing outstanding, one way or another.  In my opinion it is just OK (3 stars) ."
89,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Liked product but expensive and borders on false advertising,I really liked this product. It did a good job conditioning and getting the tangles out. Also think it has a light pleasant smell. It is quite pricey for the amount you get... I assumed that was because it was all natural ingredients. It is nearly impossible to pronounce the many ingredients and they are printed so tiny it is difficult to even read them. I was disappointed that this product seems to give an impression of an all natural healthy product but in reality is made with all the stuff you'd find in Suave or any other low cost conditioner.

I have used this product for the past few weeks and the results have been positive. As a man, I do find it to have a strong perfume sweet smell and can be a little overwhelming for a guy. It has a pleasant scent but More fitting for a female.  Scent stays with you for a long time. The Conditioner has a thick creamy texture. After rinsing out and drying my hair it was very soft. Combed nicely. Was over all pleased with the product."

My particular batch has a much lighter scent than some others have described.  What I enjoy the most is that it hasn't made my hair heavy every day.  The price point for the performance is on point, and it's free from artificial colors which is something I was looking for.  I still prefer my Kenra conditioners, but this was a nice change of pace and is not bad for the price!  It definitely works better than the average drug store formula."
92,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Conditioner!,"I received a free sample of this conditioner and it was to die for. The smell is intoxicating. It wasn't too heavy and my very long hair was very light and not weighed down by film left by many other conditioners. Most ""foo foo"" conditioners are too light and don't do much (in my opinion.) This one has a great balance of actually conditioning my hair and making it silky smooth without weighing it down. I will definitely be buying this conditioner in the future. I am in love!"
93,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Restoring Conditioner for Extremely Damaged Hair and Over Processed Hair, 12 fl oz , 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Heavy, medicinal scent, mediocre quality","Have been using this conditioner for about six months and the smell is offensive. It gets a little better when it's washed out, but it's best to smell it before buying it. It doesn't smell like almonds, it smells like medicine or heavy perfume.I don't think this conditioner makes a noticeable difference in smoothing, frizz reduction, or shine."

Not colored or processed.  We've been using another conditioner in a primarily African American line but she didn't like the smell (coconut).  This one has won her over completely.  After she gets out of the shower, she puts a dime size dab in hand and coats her hands and then start at the ends works her way to the roots.There is no residue and it washes out completely the next time so there are no flaky specs."

This conditioner made a big difference in just one use. My hair felt much silkier and smoother and I received comments about how healthy it looked, even though it has gotten long. I tried to avoid putting too much near my roots which can make them look oily. I see this more as a deep-conditioning treatment. The only thing I didn't like was the scent. Thankful it doesn't seem to linger after my hair dries."

Leaves hair feeling incredibly soft and smooth in a way that seems to last, long after use -- even after additional washings.This is made for processed, damaged hair and is especially emollient. It also smells really nice, without being overpowering.My sister-in-law, who has very thick hair that tends to be dry, swears by Carol's Daughter products."

Although I go naturally curly most of the time, I do like to change it up sometimes. This line of the Carols Daughter brand is great for keeping my hair in great condition. I use it BEFORE I straighten my curls and after having worn the straighter styles."

Even though this conditioner says it is for damaged, over-processed hair it works great for me. I like the way my hair feels and styles after using this product.  Also I like the pump container. For me the only take away (1 star) is the fragrance. Just made me think of suntan lotion."

This stuff works best if left on for about 5 mins. The package was broken when I received it and it took vinegar to get it off my hands. I am not used to fragrance and this is a little stronger than I like. My hair is better after a few uses.

It leaves my hair (colored, wavy, and tending toward dryness and tangling) soft and smoother. I like the way it feels afterwards, although I wouldn't use it everyday--once or twice a week seems best.

It’s not better than the discounted Shea moisture’s conditioner, but this conditioner works close to it. I warm it up and add oil to it and it adds a really nice slip to my 4c hair. I do recommend to my low porosity sisters"

Least not for me. I am black and I have used other Carol's Daughter products and have good results with them but this ... I was so mad after spending almost 10 mins (felt like an hour) trying to comb through my hair and running into tangles. I will never buy this again and can not recommend it - at all!!!! It was the worst leave in conditioner I have ever used. And to be honest it costs way too much to be this awful of a product

I have tried many from salons,  ulta you name it.You will love this ! I put it on wet hair when I get out of shower.  Controls my frizz and makes my hair so soft.

My hair fell out due to a stylist wrongly overprocessing my hair. I left that stylist, found another, and only recently visited my new stylist due to the pandemic. With the aid  of the monoi products, my hair  is shoulder length. I must add that I also use a bit of cream-based oil, and I wash my hair on a regular basus."

Dried my hair out,Very disappointed in this leave in. I love the whole line of moni carols daughter. But i had never tried the leave in. I use it on my deep wave brazilian weave. It totally dried the hair out with no moisture at all. I wonder of this was truly made by the product line or has been altered by the seller. I only say this because all of moni’s products are wonderful. So im not sure of this product is true to its ingredients or been altered

6,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Favorite, light weight",This is a favorite of mine that I have used for a while. I used the shampoo and conditioner when I was having a lot of breakage. I was happy to see a Monoi leave in conditioner. I don't put a lot of chemicals in my hair but I make an exception for this. I lightly spray my hair (locs) about 2 -3 times per week. This oil is light. It doesn't leave any sticky residue. My hair is just soft with a very light scent which dissipates quickly.

It is almost water.  There seems to be little to no conditioners in it.  I understand it is a leave in product but even at those standards I feel is does not have enough actual conditioner in it. It is basically a fragrance for your hair. And I was not that crazy about the fragrance.  Very over priced for what you get.

40,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The design and packaging of the spray bottle looks promising. Ingredients and instructions are clearing stated for its purpose which is repairing our hairs. It did that, but not a full pleasant process in my experience.I am not a stranger to leave-in hair treatments or conditioners.  I have used a few brands in the market in the past 5 years because my hairs are naturally thin and dry. I need leave-in conditioner to protect my hairs under the brutal sun and this product achieved that. I tried it for 2 days and it kept my hairs moist and shine under the sun and my hairs could be combed and styled easily after my sleep without shampooing and hairdryer. That preserve the natural oil for my scalp and no unnecessary heat torture for my hairs in the morning. It also saved me time and money.  My hairs look healthier due to the added shiny layer and they also seem to be more straight than usual and I am happy with that.However, the scent from this leave-in conditioner is a little funky. I guess it is a either you love it or hate it thing. I was pleasant in the beginning, but it lingered all day and it made me feel annoyed by it. Also, my coworkers in office could pick up the scent near by easily and they kept asking what was that smell. It doesn’t stink or anything, but it doesn’t make me feel comfortable that people know that it is on my hairs. I am still using it, but I will only use it on stay home weekends and staycations."
41,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I had really high hopes for this product. I typically use a professional quality leave-in conditioner, but I have used more affordable leave-in conditioners in the past so I can make a fair comparison. This product feels like it should cost half the asking price of $19.The first thing that stands out about this product is the awful smell. It's horrible. I use this on wet hair and the smell stays noticeable until my hair dries. Once dry, I don't notice the scent anymore. Once you get over the smell, the product just doesn't stand up to the claims that it makes. It states that it will detangle hair, and add shine, softness, and manageability. It doesn't detangle at all. It does add shine, but it's greasy and if you touch your hair, the product comes off on your hands even after hours. As far as adding manageability to my hair, it seemed to hold heat styling for longer with this product, but I had to clean my straightener and curling iron after using them when I had this product on my hair.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this. It doesn't detangle, it adds grease and weight to hair, and it makes your styling tools filthy."
42,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I generally like this brand, but this was a bit of a miss for me. It smells great, but it did little in the way of moisturizing my thick-but-fine, tangle-prone, dry blonde hair. I tried it after my shower with nothing else; it didn't help me get through the tangles at all, and my hair air-dried a bit frizzy and dry looking. I tried it before my usual styling product, and the results were no different than if I had just used my stuff alone. I did find that it works well as a shine spray, or as an extra dose of moisture, on dry hair. It doesn't make a lot of difference, but it does impart a nice scent, makes my hair look shinier, and makes it feel slicker (and less tangle prone), at least for a couple of hours (I was back to tangles by day's end).For some reason it seems like this product doesn't penetrate my hair properly; it seems to just sit on it until it dries up. That makes it a nice finishing product, but not a good leave-in (at all) for me."
43,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very nice leave in conditioner. It can be applied to wet hair as a detangler or to dry hair to refresh your hair. I usually use it after I showered and I have to admit, this made my hair feel amazing. I brushed right through it without a tangle in sight! It also has a very pleasant scent that I just can't identify what it smells like, so it must be that monoi oil since I am not sure what that would smell like, but I REALLY like it a lot. The smell lingers for a bit and I wouldn't mind smelling it for a lot longer than it did.Once my hair was dry it looked beautiful. It was nice and shiny, did not look greasy, heavy or limp. I was very happy with how it looked and felt, very nice and soft just the way I like it. You don't need a lot of it either which is great since it isn't the cheapest, but also not the most expensive product I own.Fantastic product that I am very happy I found and will be repeat purchasing!"
44,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For years I have bleached my hair and because of this I have very damaged and dry split ends. I have to apply a leave in conditioner every time I take a shower because if I don't I can't even run my brush through my hair. This is a decent leave in hair conditioner that untangles my hair and helps it feel more soft and manageable. It gives my hair a little shine and what I love most about it is the smell it leaves behind, even after my hair has dried.I have used many leave in hair conditioners over the years and find this one to be pretty good.  This isn't as effective as some of the higher priced brands but his fair for the price. I do notice that this leaves my hair feeling like a bit of residue is Left Behind when I use it though so make sure to only use a little bit."
45,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing!!,"I have used the monoi shampoo and conditioner from Carol's daughter for over 6 years and it makes my fine long straight hair feel so smooth and shiny. The smell is absolutely stunning, coconut and Jasmine flowers. I was so excited to get a chance to try this. It is a unique product, a cross between detangler, leave in treatment, and hair oil. It smells exactly like the shampoo and conditioner. I use it every morning to style my hair without the greasy buildup. The sprayer makes it easy to use, and if you don't do much with your hair other than brush it out and put it up, this is a Time saver since it smoothes your hair and makes your hair look more sleek and put together by sleeking and smoothing flyaways. I'll be using this to the last drop. Will definitely be getting more in the future."
46,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Wifey has had some difficulties with her hair of late and has been trying different things to help. Here is her experience with this conditioner:Sometimes being on different medications it will affect and damage your hair by weakening it and making it brittle. After a long barrage of them, this had happened to me. So I was hoping that using Carol’s Daughter Monoi Leave-in Conditioner would help. I know that nothing is a 100 percent cure but it did help make it softer and shinier. I like that you could use it on your hair whether it is wet or dry, I will say that I was concerned when I first sprayed it on dry hair it did have a greasy look until it dried and was very soft. I will continue to use the product long enough to verify whether there is an improvement or not."
47,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"don’t know what in this set off a sneezing frenzy but, something in it does within a minute and it does not matter if i spray it on (which i though why i kept sneezing the first time) nor matter if i spray in into my hand and put it into my hair that way, i end up sneezing away.. The fragrant may just be the culprit, it is 4th in ingredients and super perfume-y (fragrant is also listed again towards end as well).. It did make the frizzy tamed down without needing a lot and gave my hair (caucasian hair) a smooth shiny look so if strong fragrant product isn’t an issue for you, you may like this.Not recommend for those that get sinus migraines from strong perfume/chemical smells.."
48,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Carol’s Daughter Monoi leave-in conditioner works well. I have dry, over-processed, frizzy hair, and it really smoothed out the frizzies and helped to make my hair look tamer and less dry. It did also seem to make it stronger. This is just what I was looking for. Instead of silicones, there are oils in here, such as Tiare Gardenia flower, monoi oil, and Coconut Oil to hydrate and condition the hair. There is also wheat protein and vitamin B5 to strengthen and nourish it. This does not feel greasy or oily. There is no petrolatum, mineral oil, or artificial color. All I do is spray it on my hair when needed, and comb through. I did not notice any scent in this product."

The scent alone will have you coming back for more. I have dry, damaged, color treated, long hair and this is uhmazing! I spray on when my hair is damp and it keeps everything feeling and looking so much more healthy, especially the ends! My hair is softer and more manageable now. I also spray on when my hair is dry when I feel like I need just a little bit of moisture and to freshen up. This is an amazing product that I will definitely purchase again! Great stuff"
50,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,First unfortunately the bottle leaked during delivery. It was all over the inside of the package. Be careful when you open it. I love the product. It smells great (like gardenia lotion). I love how I can spray it on my hair in the morning and still smell it on there when I go to bed at night. I've been using it for several weeks and my hair seems softer and healthier than when I started with it. I just spray a couple of times after my shower and then massage it in. My hair is not all tangled up and i can run a brush through it easily then. I only use a little bit each time so I'm guessing this will last me a long time. Very happy about that!
51,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I'm torn about this review.  I LOVE Carol's Daughter products.  I really do.  But it is very hard to determine if this product does all that it claims after just a few uses AND not using it with other brands products.  I love leave-in conditioners.  When I applied this it was like other spray leave-ins.  Easy to apply and moisturized my hair.  As far as the repair and al the other claims, I'm just not sure.  I wouldn't not use it.  It did seem to add moisture to my natural 4-something type hair.  What I liked is that my hair felt moisturized AND I didn't have to have the ENTIRE product line to feel it.  Thank you."
52,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I received an 8 ounce bottle of Carols daughters, leave in conditioner. The Leave-In Conditioner is supposed to add strength and restore natural moisture to your hair. The product contains a blend of the Tiare Gardenia Flower and Coprah Coconut Oil - plus Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5. Directions -Hold bottle 6-8 inches from hair and spray all over. Use on wet or dry hair to help detangle. Use on dry hair to refresh style. Don't rinse out. The conditioner smells like an overwhelming strong perfume. I am not fond of the smell. The conditioner is also a bit sticky. Overall, it's ok."
53,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,This is a very good product so far. I've used it repeatedly over the past few weeks and it's been working well as a leave in conditioner. It helps so much with tangles and it leaves my hair with a nice healthy shine. It has so many natural ingredients and none of those damaging ones in so many other products. It seems to be working great and it smells delightful as well. I recommend it if you are looking for a good leave in conditioner that adds a little boost to your hair and makes it look refreshed and renewed.
54,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This is by far the WORST leave-in conditioner I have EVER used! My hair is fine and I normally don't need a lot of conditioner to make it feel smooth and silky and to detangle so I was shocked when I first sprayed on this conditioner and could feel my hair getting drier and tougher and actually feeling brittle, like hay. The scent is terrible as well. It was so bad that I thought it must be my imagination so I tried again and nope. IT IS AWFUL!  My hair would have felt better using nothing at all! Awful. Just...awful."
55,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Success depends on the hair cut. Adds body and texture. Smells nice.,"This would probably work well with a short layered  boyish hair style because it does add body and texture. My hair is fine, thick, and currently cut in a mid-neck length bob and it needs to be smooth and silky. After shampooing and wrapping my hair in a towel for about ten minutes I applied the product. I was pleased with it at that point because it made my hair easy to comb the tangles out of. But once dry I knew that this leave-in conditioner isn't right for my hair right now. The scent is nice."
56,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really like Carols daughter products so when I seen a leave in conditioner I was super excited! This product has a light smell not too strong and powerful but it does leave a good scent behind. I washed my hair a few times and sprayed this in afterwards. I was able to run my fingers through my hair better and it didn’t leave a greasy shine behind like some leave in conditioners do. Also great price sometimes these products tend to be expensive so this was a steal.
57,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,I did not like the scent,This leave in conditioner is really nice - and detangles my hair really well. However I think the scent is overwhelming and somewhat old fashion - I am not a big fan of it.The spray is working really well to refresh second day hair. The sprayer is really good too and has a fine mist.The price is good. The only thing I wish that the scent was different or that is was fragrance free. It is hard to describe the scent but I am not liking it.

However, it's not great for fine hair like mine because it weighs it down.  Also, I like hair products that smell like herbal essence products.  Although this smells good, it doesn't compare to herbal essence."
