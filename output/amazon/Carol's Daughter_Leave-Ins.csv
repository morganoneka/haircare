0,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,So much VOLUME,I DONT like this product but it’s just because of my hair type. I avoid the word volume like the plague because my hair already has a lot of volume. I ordered this because I didn’t see anything about volume on the package or in the product description and it SMELLS AMAZING!! But it makes my hair have an insane amount of volume so I can’t use it. Tried it on my 3 year olds hair and got the same result even tho I’ve never had an issue with too much volume in her hair before. Wanted to leave a review so you can order according to your hair type
1,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,I like this leave in conditioner,"I like this leave in conditioner, but it runs out quite fast for me - I have a hard time gauging quanitity with a spray leave-in conditioner.But it smells fantastic. And it is very light, maybe a little too light, because it's hard to know when you've used too much. It doesn't build up at all, doesn't harden, it just kind of makes your hair a little curlier (as a 2C/3A curly girl). And on a bad curly hair day, it's hard to know if it's doing anything at all, I hate to admit. It's nice, but I prefer to use it in conjunction with other leave in conditioners, or to use it as a refresher spray on damp 2nd day hair. I think it's a little too expensive for me to buy again, especially since it's a product that left me feeling only lukewarm, but it is a good price to buy as a refresher spray."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The smell is Heavenly; leaves my biracial daughter’s curls detangled moisturized soft & never crispy,"I love that I can get Carol’s Daughter on Amazon. I knew the maker of these products when she was making them in her kitchen in Brooklyn. The scent is Heavenly! Ingredients are all natural. I have used Carol’s Daughter products since my own daughter was a newborn, and she is now a Freshman in college! She is mixed race, and this product leaves her curls moisturized and detangled, but not weighed down or greasy. Her curls dry soft and never crispy after her hair air dries. This smell will always remind me of my baby!"

My hair felt wirey and rough. It smells nice though."
4,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for me, hair like hay after use",Unfortunately this did not work for me.  I’m African American with relaxed hair.  I was looking for something to use while all the beauty shops were closed due to the corona virus. I had picked up the shampoo version of this product at Target.The combination dried out my hair to the point it felt like straw or hay.  I try using more of this product.  I tried using less and nothing worked.  I still had the same outcome.  I had nothing else in the house to use but this & the matching shampoo so u used it.Please note my hair is typically soft and bouncy.
5,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Adds Shine and Manageability,"I recently cut my hair and my texture changed and I had issues with finding products that would keep my hair moisturized. It promotes the definition of my curls, and shine and allows for great manageability. It also has a great smell. I use this in collaboration with the black vanilla shampoo, conditioner and Comb through creme. Right after I wash and apply the creme I spray this over my hair and do a last comb through and it adds that extra shine. I use this daily to refresh my hair as well. It has given me amazing results."
6,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dries hair more,"I love the smell of it which is why I'll give it 2 stars, but it didn't help my hair. My curls got stiff and dry. The texture turned straw-like. I don't use any heat tools including blow drying. i let my hair air dry because I'm trying to grow it out. I tried using it in both damp and dry hair, but it always looked like I soaked my hair in sugar water. I wouldn't buy this again."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Liquid gold - CG APPROVED,"I am not into complicated routines. I subscribe to the Curly Girl Method but I keep it simple and cheap. I use sauve essentials or tresemme botanique as a co wash but eventually I found that my hair was dull and dry, (but still better than it was with any other routine). I finally gave in and found this CGM approved leave-in conditioner for a boost of moisture. I now have the perfect routine for my hair! I honestly did not expect it to be this good. I've tried so many leave-in conditioners and they usually make my hair look really greasy or they weigh it down, ruining my curls. This is like pure lightweight silk on my hair. I found that the overall poofiness/volume of my hair did decrease somewhat after I applied it but that is only because I had so much frizz and this took care of all the frizz. I added a few sprays on each side of my head while I was still in the shower with shopping wet hair and squeezed it in (""squish to condish"") after co washing with my usual conditioner (the cheap one) and this product provided all the moisture that my hair could ever want. It was instantly super silky and slippery in the shower. If you have tangly hair this would probably help you a lot.Tl;dr -This stuff is liquid gold. Super silky. Tamed my frizz and tangles. CGM APPROVED! With how good this product is, they could honestly charge more (pls don't)Thank you Carol's Daughter for making this awesome product!"

9,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not satisfied with product,Hi I have very thick hair and it tends to be a little dry at times. I ordered this product because I'm always open to trying new things on my hair. It did absolutely nothing for my hair. As a matter of fact it made my hair feel crispy.  Maybe others have had positive results after using this product but not me. Also the scent is very over powering. It is like strong vanilla overload.
10,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Made my scalp burn and itch terribly!!,I've purchased this product many times in the store and loved it. But I'm not sure if I recieved a bad product or what but as soon as I sprayed this in my hair....my hair started itching non stop and burning!!! I was shocked bc I've purchased this same item from target and etc before! I immediately washed my hair and just thought the burning and itching was caused by something else bc I use black castor oil and others on my hair daily to moisturize it.I used this spray again and my hair started burning and itching horribly! I'm not sure if amazon is selling the same product as you would get from a store but this can not be the same formula Carol's daughter uses in their normal leave in spray!Threw it away and will never purchase this from Amazon again!
11,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Defrizzes, super lightweight",I have wavy hair that with the right product gets curly. I've used this for a while now and have to say it's the best stuff I've ever used hands down. If I put a little in it softens my hair to style with but more gives me the curls I can let hang down. I spritz it after a shower and go to bed and wake up with all kinds of curls and angles. It keeps my frizz down without having to put in my creams. If my hair is longer I use the mix just to keep it controlled. If you need light weight softening and defrizzing definitely try it!(I will note that I've used it for morning showers and my hair tends to poof as it dries and it only helps if I'm not moving around or pin it a bit. Still makes it super soft frizz at least :P)
12,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, but doesn’t work","Let’s start with the good: like everyone else said, it smells great! I also liked that it didn’t have all the bad stuff in it. Turns out, it may need some of those things to work well.Overall, I’m not impressed with this as a leave in conditioner. I have long, highlighted, fine blond hair. I typically use a leave in conditioner as a detangler and to provide extra moisture to the ends of my hair. This doesn’t do either well.  It takes me so long to brush out my hair I might as well not be using any products at all.  Seriously, Suave kids works better than this. The ends of my hair feel dry, snagly, and crunchy after I use this. I would return it if I could, but I’ve been using it for a week trying to give it a fair shot. The only good news is I need to use soooo much of this to brush out my hair that it won’t take me long to use it up so I can go back to Argan Magic 10 in 1 which really is truly magic compared to this."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for Fine, Straight Hair","I have extremely fine, straight hair, and I was looking for a conditioner to use before blow drying. This works great! It is not too heavy and the scent is light (it actually disappears after drying). I suffer from periodic hair loss, and this doesn't weigh down my fine hair at all. Now I actually skip my conditioner--I just shampoo and spray this on. Even air-drying my hair, this doesn't weigh it down. My hair is also graying, and the gray hair is silky soft. I recommend this for those with fine, straight hair."
14,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great!,"I had been using a cheaper, coconut oil based leave in conditioner spray. I mostly just use it for detangling but my hair is a weird mix of wavy and straight and I’ve noticed with some products, it has a more even wavy texture. I didn’t notice this product helping much in terms of my hair texture but I didn’t really expect much there so it’s fine! It smells amazing, my hair is super soft, and it’s shiny. It also has better ingredients than my cheaper spray so that’s a plus. I also use it on my daughter’s very fine straight hair and it definitively helps us brush it and keep it detangled."
15,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Is this the real product? It made my hair worse than before.,"I'm not sure if I received the real product, as the brand itself has great reviews, however the leave-in spray I received is anything but. I ordered the Black Vanilla spray, as someone in the comments recommended it for dry, damaged hair. I put it in after brushing my hair out the night prior, and woke up to extremely dry, knotted and tangled hair. I even had tangles near my scalp where it is normally greasy. I was trying to find some type of product comparable to the It's A 10, but more light weight. This is not it. I'm pulling the knots out of my hair and my strands along with it. Despite my hair being somewhat damaged, I have relatively healthy, strong hair. It was on track to getting its moisture back, but I feel like this product put me right back to where I had just bleached it moisture-wise."
16,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, but works terribly!","As a stylist, I am always on the hunt for budget friendly products that work well. I was really excited to try this after several recommendations. The smell is amazing, the product is terrible though. My hair is long and curly, and this product dried my hair out horribly. It has taken me 3 weeks worth of treatments to rescue it from the swimming pool texture it was after using this ""leave in"". I would not recommend this to anyone."
17,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not an effective leave in conditioner.,"I use Carol's Daughters black vanilla conditioner and love it, so I thought the leave in conditioner would be great as well. Not the case. I wasn't expecting a spray, liquid leave in conditioner, but that's my fault for not paying attention. Fiiiine product itself does not reduce frizz or make your hair shiny, it acts more like a hair conditioner, which is not what I need or want. Smells nice though."

19,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells SO good,I absolutely love all the carols daughter products. Especially this leave in conditioner. It smells so amazing but it’s not overpowering. My only complaint is that it sometimes leaves a purple residue on my pillowcase. But it is well worth the conditioning effect and the smell. But just so others are aware you might find that. I noticed it most when I’m using it on my braids so it might have something to do with that.
20,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best product ever for curly, frizzy, fine, hair!","Stop searching. This is the product. I have all of her products. I searched for decades for a wonderful line of hair miracles and HERE IT IS! You are welcome! :) Moisturizes, softens, and makes my massive yet fine, curly, frizzy mop manageable & the ability to style it or leave it down. Really. Buy all of it. And the prices are silly low. I love you, Carol’s Daughter!!"
21,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Drying. not hydrating.,I have been using this since 2010 on braids extensions. It is not hydrating. It is drying. This is more of a hair perfume.Everyone loves the scent.l I recently switched to pure aloe vera juice using the LCO method and cornrows. Im finally approaching mid-back in 2021. You are better off using filtered water and  a creme leave in conditioner. The fact that I switched this product and immediately saw more length retention should tell you something.
22,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not condition,"I thought this was going to be a conditioning product.

Instead it’s more like a hair fragrance. It does smell really good, I have to give it that but because it’s listed as a leave in conditioner it only gets 1 star"
23,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of alcohol and cheap smell (STICKY!),Feels like putting cheap perfume in your hair. Literally feels like perfume and not conditioning at all. It smells like rubbing alcohol which isn’t surprising since glycerin (a type of alcohol) is the fourth ingredient. It also contains citric acid and benzoyl alcohol above the good active ingredients. This is very disappointing. (Update I decided to give it a try and it is literally sticky and my hair became matted and disgusting)
24,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product.,"I love this product.  It is one of the best I've found.  I am 54 years old and I have let my hair go to its natural color, which is now mixed with gray curls.  This product really brings out the curl and leaves my hair softer than many products. It smells amazing too."
25,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and easy to use!,Love this product!! I am not one who uses a lot of hair products but this is so easy to use. You can use it while your hair is damp or dry which is nice. It smells really good not to overwhelming but nice. You are sure to get compliments from anyone who comes close to you. I feel like when my hair is looking dull it adds more life to it.

I have thick but fine curls (AKA thin hair strands, but a lot of them), maybe type 2b/2c with average porosity.  This stuff made my hair crispy and brittle-feeling.  If I wanted that feeling, I'd buy hair gel.  The search continues..."

28,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!,"Everything about this is amazing. From the scent to how it moisturizes, softens, and adds shine....it's just so good! I really need to buy another one."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ingredients on Amazon are listed wrong,"I purchased this the other day hoping it would be good for my low porosity hair. I clicked the ingredients section on Amazon and after reviewing them decided this would work well for me. Unfortunately I purchased it without looking at the photos of the bottle. If I would have, I would’ve seen that the second ingredient is castor oil (which tends to be a heavier oil). Now that’s not to say that this isn’t going to be a great product, but I wouldn’t have bought it if I’d noticed that. So basically, I just wanted to warn anyone who is buying this based solely on Amazon’s list of ingredients- that it is incorrect."

I actually felt like a had close to 2 times the hair in my brush after brushing as I normally did prior to this product. I will not be using this item and it will likely go in the trash."
31,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good.... and that’s it.,"Does not DETANGLE or any of that other stuff it says it does. At least not for my hair, didn’t work when the hair was out, made it dry. However I did end up using it has a mist for my hair when I had braids in, to add in some moisture and make my hair smell good. So it worked that way. If you have in a protective style you can use it to add some moisture or you can save your money and use water and some oil."
32,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Great!,I have curly hair so I was hoping it would make my hair silky and easy to brush.  It did not.  I used a Wet Brush which usually helps glide through my hair with other spray in/leave in conditioners.  It was not good at all.  It didn't help with knots or tangles.  I even used the same brand shampoo and conditioner.

It has a phenomenal smell and works on curly or straight hairstyles, wet or dry hair. It adds a sheen to my hair when I spray it on my hair right before styling. It gives an extra layer of conditioning right after I wash it, especially when I wear my hair in natural styles. It is a good value."

I cam spray water in my hair to get it wet, so I don't need $10 spray water."

It arrived timely with no issues with the packaging. However, when I applied it to my hair which is fine, it really weighed my hair down.

I received two bottles, both of which had some weird mold-like substance at the bottom.

I don't know or really care if it has any actual conditioning properties but spraying this on after washing leaves my curls defined and bouncy. It has a small amount hold and keeps frizz at bay.

My hair felt as if I had been at a beach all day.  It was as if this made my hair more likely to tangle.  I used it on my child to style his hair and he broke out in a rash saying his head burned.  I don't know what is in this, but it doesn't work for my family."

I live in Alaska though, so I'm on a perpetual search for a product that will work for a second day, too, so I'm not cold and wet every single morning. This product did nothing I was hoping for, (besides smelling good) even on the first day of use. It goes from doing nothing, to greasy in one pump of spray. I would be willing to try the jar of creme (initially they were both in the cart to purchase) but Amazon won't ship it to Alaska."

53,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Leaves hair dry and stiff, but smells good I guess","So I’ve tried this product a handful of times now and it made my hair feel more stiff, knotted, and dry. I have thicker/wavy hair, and literally can’t even run my fingers through my hair after use. Almost worked as like a pomade for me which would’ve been nice if I had short hair, but as a guy with longer hair it really isn’t working at all. I threw a almost full bottle away just due to the fact I don’t even want to try and refund it. If you have long, wavy, naturally dry hair I recommend using Tea Tree leave in conditioner, works a lot better for me. Hope this helps."

My daughter is half black and mexican almost 5 years old and I used this product for two weeks and it dried her hair out. Dried out the ends. I had to purchase another product to restore her hair.  Maybe it should only be for adults.

This smells like coconut, as mentioned by other reviews. It does not detangle at all nor moisturize. My toddler, who is mixed, has medium length curly hair with a fine texture. It is painful to try to comb his hair with this product. Maybe he doesn't have the right hair texture. I'll be returning to the ion series leave in conditioner. The scent is pleasing but too strong."

My natural coiled hair is thin and dry. This product doesn't work for me as a standalone. I didn't get the softness or the shine that I expected. It is moisturizing in the sense that it's wet. The scent is great and is one of the reasons I keep using it.

514,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Look into protein overload if your hair turns dry or brittle using protein daily,"I saw  this worked for some, for others it made their hair straw like or brittle.  I've had that problem myself with other products.  You can try getting products with no protein.  Look up ""protein overload"" and see if that fits your hair if you experience dryness or brittleness using a product with protein daily.You have to learn all the names for protein if you do need to correct your protein/moisture balance.  I'm no expert but also see if you can find a trichologist with good ratings who understands your hair type in your area if you are having bad hair problems as many of us experience (they can be a different race or have different hair than you if they do really understand your specific hair type but make sure in advance).  They can be more affordable than you'd think and they do a much more in depth microscopic look at your hair strands and scalp than a dermatologist or hair dresser.  I wish I'd known about trichologists years ago and wonder how much hair I could have saved."
515,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Can be crunchy, smells amazing. No-cones!","I got this because I recently fried my hair bleaching it from about a level 3 (darkest brown and with a lot of silver, virgin) to a 9 within 24 hours. My hair is Curly 3B, fine but I have a lot of it. I was looking for products that would help to strengthen it again without silicones since they coat the hair and create a barrier that won't allow oils to penetrate. It's difficult to find no-cone products so after scanning bottles at Target for a long time I was surprised to find that this leave-in doesn't contain any. When I first tried it I noticed that it made my hair crunchy and stiff which I didn't like, but at the same time it felt better than it being extremely light and wispy and having no substantial weight which is what bleaching did to it. I actually added another product (manic panic hot hot pink, about 1/2 teaspoon into the travel size of the black vanilla) to it to create a cocktail and after that and some experimenting, I now really like it. I'm giving it 5 stars because even though it can feel crunchy, if I use it right I get the results I want. The way I use it now is after I shampoo and condition, I press my hair with my towel, and wrap it up for a minute or two. I then spray all my hair with this, maybe 20 sprays with the travel size. Then I add a dime sized amount of another leave-in cream, the rose one by andalou naturals and work them both through gently. The picture shows my hair this morning after that routine, carefully brushing and then sleeping on it (I don't usually brush or comb but I did to better distribute the products). You can still see my hair is fried but it's MUCH better than it was. When I combed my hair last night it felt pretty stiff. I haven't tried this yet bc I don't own a hair dryer but I plan to try this before blow-drying and I think it will provide some hold and help straighten. I think the trick to this is using it on wet or damp hair and in conjunction with other products that contain oil or provide slip. It has ingredients that attract moisture which can be good or bad depending on the climate you live in... I think with that you just have to experiment though to see how it effects your hair. For example I live in a very humid climate but I'm indoors with the AC on most of the time. My hair gets some argan and coconut oil and I sometimes spray with water and go out in the humid air so it's a mix of wet and dry factors and my own hair type and health. There are too many factors to assess without experimentation. For me though, this is a great leave-in spray and I plan to get the full size. It does smell delicious too. I used it on my son's hair (which is bleached to a 10 from a 6 and also curly3B, the photo of the pink and blue streaks) and his hair continues to smell yummy for days and days. The travel size is about $3 and I think if used sparingly on wet or damp hair it won't be too crunchy. My hair doesn't really tangle but I don't see this being a great detangling spray. I'm also including a photo of my hair straightened so you can see that this really does give even damaged hair some substance. My hair feels stronger (have been using this for about 2 weeks) and I think it will continue to improve."

Carols Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Sulfate-Free Shampoo, 12 Ounce

   and hydrating conditioner 

Carols Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hydrating Conditioner, 12 Ounce

  , all in the Black Vanilla scent. I actually bought them from Sally's Beauty Supply and am sorry I did not check Amazon first because the price is MUCH better on Amazon!I have waist-length Caucasian hair that is thick, tends to frizz in the humidity and has a natural but dumb-looking wave to it. I always blowdry my hair and usually flat-iron it too to achieve that smooth look. Unfortunately this leaves my hair VERY dry at the ends. I also exercise 6 days a week so my scalp tends to get sweaty but it's such a chore to style my hair after washing it that I only wash it 3 days a week. So I needed something that would not weigh down my crown but would super-moisturize the ends. I was using the Banana shampoo & conditioner from The Body Shop but they didn't work for me. Previously that that I loved Paul Mitchell's Lavender & Mint line, but it was just too expensive for my budget.I LOVE this stuff and I hope it is around forever & ever! The shampoo, conditioner and leave-in smell amazing! My hair was tangle-free getting out of the shower, a first for me with my long locks! The line is just so rich-feeling and it leaves my hair shiny and smooth.The leave-in is my favorite by far; I spritz it on my hair when it is about 70% air dried and then blowout my hair. Once flat-ironed, I use a silicone serum (Got 2 B) with a spritz of this Black Vanilla leave-in mixed in and Oh. My. God. Glossy hair that smells amazing and has zero frizz! After a workout I put a bit of the leave-in on my roots to freshen them up and I still can't believe it doesn't weigh my hair down."

Then it dawned on me maybe its the smell of this spray. Not really a scent I wear or go for. Went and washed it out straight away with my usual shampoo/conditioner and he went right back to normal, he even smelled my hair to double check and let out a sigh of contentment!

518,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work on my 3C-4A hair,"I really wanted to like this product, if not for anything else than to end my addiction to Miss Jessie's products.  I have multi-racial, multi-textured, shoulder length, thick hair (Spanish, Black, Caucasian) which is very curly and soft.  With Miss Jessie's products (especially her Leave-In Condish) my hair is very soft, easy to comb and very curly and glossy.I used this product on both wet and dry hair.  On dry hair it made it feel sticky at first but then after a couple hours my hair turned dry and frizzy like an afro and was completely unmanageable. My comb could not get one inch through my hair. My 'S' curls were completely gone and it was one thick bush of hair.  I also tried it on wet hair, completely wet coming out of the shower.  I often comb my hair in the shower while it's wet, so after the shower I sprayed this on and put my hair up in a bun while still soaking wet and let it air dry.  Again, no 'S' curls, just frizz.I have known about Carol's Daughter for years and I've never tried the products only because they are not sold anywhere near me, but I can't imagine I would purchase this again.  However, I will try this on damp hair and I will ask my husband (who is Puerto Rican with glossy black curls, type 3B) to try it as well.  I don't throw away items so I'm sure it'll work for someone, sadly, just not for me.  Back to Miss Jessie's Coily Pudding for me."
519,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Effective and aromatic,"My hair is long, thick and on the oily side.  After washing and while blow drying, I use a fair amount of leave-in conditioner.  I am always on the hunt for new products to try.  This conditioner from Carol's Daughter concerned me a little because it emphasizes moisturizing in the product description.  However, it actually seems less oily or creamy than some of the other products I have used that I considered satisfactory.The thing with this conditioner, is the scent.  As the name suggests, it is vanilla scented.  Personally I like it but be aware that it overwhelms the scent of shampoo, cologne, or any other products you might happen to use.  The effect lasts a good long time - not indefinitely but for a few hours anyway.As far as the efficacy of the product itself, it definitely removes the tangles in my long hair.  A little goes a fairly long way.  This is a good sized bottle so I will be using it for awhile.  Really, if the scent weren't so strong (keeping in mind that not everyone will like it), this would easily be a 5-star product.  Sometimes I might prefer not to smell like vanilla, but as long as I'm using this product, that is going to be my signature scent."

It made my hair slippery and crunchy which was really weird. It did not help my hair detangle and did not moisturize my hair at all. I'd recommend this product for looser curls or even straight hair. I tested this on a friend who has bone-straight hair and she loves it. It really made her hair shine and softened it up. We're in a colder climate, so maybe if you live in a warmer climate with humidity your results may be different."

This product makes that possible for me and keeps my hair looking beautiful and voluminous. It’s the only product I use after washing as well to refresh next day hair. There is no crunchy feeling like you’d get from a mousse or hairspray, at least in my experience. It leave my hair soft, manageable, and the smell. Oh. My. Goodness. The smell is amazing! It lasts all day, and my husband always comments on how nice my hair smells."

I didn't really that this was a spray-on product (which I usually don't like), but the pump works well on this, and it's easy to use even when your hands are slippery and wet in the shower.I'm growing out a short cut that just touches my shoulders, and a few sprays of this work well. It also really does help with the tangles.  I also like the vanilla scent, but just know that it will linger in your hair for a few hours after using it."
523,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells VERY good and leaves fine hair weightless but moisturized.,"I've been no-poo for almost 2 & 1/2 years now and I don't think I will ever go back to using shampoo and conditioner. But I've been in the process of letting my gray grow out for a couple of years now too. Which has left the bottom 7"" or 8"" of my hair pretty fried from old dye jobs. Combine that with living in a really dry climate that's been getting cold and my regular ACV and water conditioning treatment just wasn't cutting it. Worried that any commercial conditioner, even a leave-in, would weigh my hair down I was hesitant. But just looking at this product you can see it's translucent and not going to leave a greasy, heavy feeling.To my joy this not only smells divine (and I'm normally not a vanilla fan!), it has really helped my hair while leaving it light. I feel as if there's nothing in it, it's that lightweight. Even so, it managed to leave my ends feeling smoothed and shiny. I honestly didn't think it was possible!!! I love this so much I think I might switch to this long-term and quit my usual stuff for a while."
524,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Just wasn't for me,"I was very hopeful about this product because a lot of people had recommended it to me. Unfortunately, the scent was not something I could deal with so I couldn't even tell you about any results. The results other people are seeing look great but for me personally I just can't use things with scents that are this strong. It was more like and overly sweet vanilla extract scent mixed with something else I couldn't place. Again, my nose is very sensitive so it could smell and work perfectly for you so I suggest just forming your own opinion on it."
525,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for 'plopping' or letting hair air dry naturally, no silicone. does have cornstarch--can get crispy","I have coarse(ish) naturally curly hair and love leave in conditioners for pre-styling use! However if you plan on flatironing or blowdrying straight don't use this. It's perfect for when I want to spray it in and let my hair dry naturally, but not for anything else. It has cornstarch in it, and that's all I can think to explain why my hair got so crispy and crunchy when I tried to flatiron.This has no silicones in it----and I liked that a lot. My normal go to is Milkshake leave in, I can do anything with that. It does have silicone in it though and some people don't care for that.I gave this to my friend with three biracial daughters and they totally love it. Her son even loved it for the smell and wanted some in his hair! I love how this gives my curls structure when 'plopping' them or just letting them air dry.  I wouldn't use it as much as my friend will so I passed it on."

Leave in conditioner is meant to make your hair soft not tangled and damaged! I tried brushing out the fry brittle strands and had to cut out a chunk of tangles that were knotted severely! I only had this in my hair a few hours and it made my hairs bind together in a horrific way! I have straight hair and it turned mine into a ball of tangles with a rough texture. I would not recommend this to anyone :(

AMAZING,"I have 4 c hair. My hair is very curly and tough. Its always very hard for me to find a shampoo that works for my hair i have bought expensive shampoos and in expensive shampoos but nothing helped my dry and unmanageable hair. Until NOW that i used this product.I read the reviews and by doing so there was no way i could not buy it . Went natural one year ago and its been tough finding products until now . Stop your frustration and just buy this product it will not let you down.benifits:1.softens2.makes hair managable3.smells good4.better then most shampoos I've use to help with moister.Negative:1.The bottle was a bit tough to open, probably because it was a safety precaution for it being shipped im guessing."

I have waist long locs that need a lot of moisture to keep them soft, pliable and touchable. This stuff is the bomb!!!  No other product compares to it and I have been using it for as long as they have been making it. It is designed to moisturize and definitely does its job. Plus, the sandalwood-like smell is noticeable but not overpowering.  I don't particularly like the cloying sweetness of vanilla, but this is much more exotic.  I am constantly having people come up to me asking what fragrance I am wearing, and I have to admit that's it is my hair conditioner.I am truly addicted to this stuff. I can't live without it.  Well, at least my hair can't 😀"
529,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Finally found a way to use this product with good results!,"I've been disappointed with this product for a long time. I originally bought it so that I could refresh my double strand twists on my natural hair because after days of wearing them they'd become dry, dull, lifeless and other products were too heavy to apply after the twists were already set in place.This product did not feel like it conditioned my hair in any way,, and in fact it was quite sticky, and I didn't even like the smell...man was I disatisfied with this!However, I'm, an avid believer in not throwing away natural products made for natural hair (especially when they are pricey) so I kept it in my cabinet for a long while when one night I had an idea...My hair was already a bit stretched out form a light blowdry and I plaited my hair (dry) into 6 sections preparing to go to bed. My hair was so dry and and I wanted to just add a light spray of water but I thought ""hey why not use that watery leave-in instead"" so I did. I sprayed the leave-in on my six fat plaits , lightly soaking the hair and completely soaking the ends...the result in the mornng was AMAZING!I had an AWESOME chunky braid out with defined and shiny wavy/curly hair!!! I was sooooo suprised..and the waves stayed defined for about 4 days, kid you not. And since its a watery substance the hair was light, fluffy, airy, and poofy and big but highly defined!I gave it the rating that I did because of my initial dissatisfaction and the fact that after experimenting numerous ways to use this product I've only found one great way to use it.But if you are looking to do a chunky braid out on dry braids...this is works great!"
530,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for daily use !!,Well.. the last week of August I had to go on a week long business trip. I know I codnt wash my hair in the middle of the week and straighten and style it again because it will consume time.. stumbled upon this on target and thought I will use this on my trip.. I started using it through Monday till Friday on my dry hair every morning( I washed my hair only on Sunday) and my hair never felt so amazing .. it was looking fresh till Saturday.. now that I have decided to try their conditioners and shampoo.. I honestly never write so much reviews unless the product strikes a difference in my life.. I wanted to spread the word and thought this review would be helpful to someone like me
531,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Great,"I really love the smell of this leave in conditioner, it has a musky vanilla scent.  I would use it just for the scent alone.  It is sometimes hard for me to find products that I can use that do not have an effect on my asthma.  This one did not bother me at all, but I did not spray it heavily.  Very pleased that it has no silicones, parabens, mineral oil, artificial colors, or petroleum.  It's so dry in my house now that the furnace is running, my hair was a bit dry and flyaway.  I just needed something to take away the dryness and make it easier to brush out my hair.  After spraying this on my hair, it feels soft, healthy, and has a bit of shine to it.  No sticky residue.  Very pleased"
532,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Leave your hair feeling very soft!,"I love, love, LOVE this leave in conditioner. I primarily use on wet hair (after washing it). I've found that it's easier to comb or brush my hair as a result of using this leave in conditioner. I tried it on my dry hair and I thought it was OK (my hands were a little sticky, but my hair felt fine), but I felt it worked better on wet hair vs dry hair. The conditioner smells very good and isn't heavy. I use this the entire line of black vanilla carol's daughter product, and the combination of the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner seem to work very well on my hair. My hair feels light (not weighed down) and is very soft. I can't get over how good my hair feels! If anything, this product is worth a try. I have 3c/4a type hair."
533,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Did Not Provide Moisture or Shine,"I have a love/hate relationship with Carol's Daughter products. Many are fabulous and well worth the money. Others do not perform as promised and are overpriced. The Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Leave In Conditioner is the latter. The description states that this product is for dry, dull and brittle hair, which describes my daughter's hair. However, after a month of use, all I can say is that my daughter's hair smells great. I have noticed no improvement with moisture or shine, so this is a product that we will discontinue using, and try another something else from the CD line."
534,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells good, not great for detangling.","Bought this for my 1 year old who has soft, curly hair. It made her hair hard and stringy and was not a good detangler. Really didn’t like it but glad i bought the travel size. 2 stars because it smells so good."
535,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best conditioner but smell great. I have 4c hair texture.,I was hoping for water consistency similar to  a product I used to buy in the 90's called Always 911 Leave in Conditioner. This products smells really nice but it's too greasy and does not really moisturize or conditions my hair. It offers my hair oil to drink when it's thirsty for water. Does not leave hair feeling soft at all. Just great hair perfume
536,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too strong of a Smell for Me,I used the Black Vanilla Moisture leave in conditioner. When you open the bottle it smells like suntan lotion. A warm coconut vanilla mix. It was very nice. But the issue I had with the product was once sprayed on my hair the smell wore on me and after a short duration of time I could no longer stand smelling myself. I had to go and wash the product out of my hair. It was simply to strong for my nose. If you are like me with a sensitive or heighten sense of smell this maybe too much.  Regarding my hair I did notice that it was not as frizzy and styled well after I was my hair. I am disappointed that I won't be able to continue to use the product to see if I notice a significant change over time.
537,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Did nothing for my hair...,"I have naturally dry, coarse hair that needs an extremely moisturizing leave-in to detangle, add softness, and tame frizz. This did none of the above, although it claimed to do it all!  I ended up spraying an incredible amount on my hair, thinking that I hadn't added enough initially because of how watery it is.  The only noticeable difference was that it added a strange texture to my hair when it dried, almost the same as a dry shampoo.  It smells wonderful, but I'm heartbroken that I spent nearly $13 on such a disappointing product!"

539,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Improves shine & manageability with a pleasant aloe scent.,"This leave in conditioner has a very pleasant aloe scent and when I used it in conjunction with other products from the same line, such as the refresher spray styling my hair was a breeze. My hair improved with the shine as well as the manageability, it was fantastic. Using this conditioner also helped me with my brittle split ends, it gave them a healthier and less dry look to them. I use this product everyday, when you spray it on it dries quickly and leaves a beautiful shine to your hair without a greasy look to it. I definitely recommend this for all hair types, especially curly to wavy thick hair. Great product."

SO. GOOD. Oh my gosh it's like the richest vanilla scent without being cloying or fake. My fiance likes it better than my perfumes.I spritz & comb it in after a shower and it helps with detangling my 2c/3a/confused hair. I think it makes things softer? But it's very lightweight.I will buy it again just because the smell cheers me up and helps me relax before bedtime.This product made me fall in love with Carol's Daughter brand and now I'm going to try all their curl milk products.
541,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE this leave-in conditioner!!!,"This is one of the best leave-in conditioners. I absolutely love the smell. I love in a very dry climate area and have lots of split-ends, however, you would never know. I spray this into my damp hair and depending on my mood, maybe add a dry hair oil, but it's really not necessary. This leave-in leaves my hair so soft amd frizz-free, which I take as a sign that my ends have been hydrated. I started using this religiously once a hair dresser told me how important it is to hydrate your ends if you have,or want, long hair, as the oils from your scalp tend to not get distributed to your ends, and they then dry out."

544,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,In love ❤️,I actually love this conditioner leaves my hair soft and very manageable. I always say to each it’s own due to I saw another review that said it left their hair hard and brittle it didn’t do that for me. TIP💕💕💕: if the scent is too heavy for you simply dilute it with 1/2 distilled water and I promise you the ingredients will still work the same plus you can get more for your money. Put the other half in another spritzer and you have 2 bottles for the price of one. I do this but the scent is sooo good.
545,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Just A Light Mist Is All You Need,"I sprayed this in my hair last night and did a two-strand twist. This morning I have a very defined twist out and my hair smells terrific.Reading other reviews about this leave-in being sticky, my thought was maybe they used too much. On one side of my head I used minimal amount of spray and on the other side I thoroughly misted my hair. On the side with more spray I will say that it is a bit sticky and the side where I just used a few spritzes it is not tacky at all, but still with defined curls. My suspicions were correct - so if you are going to use it, just use lightly."
546,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,soft & shiny,"I've used this intermittently for about a month now. While I love that it softens the hair, and makes it shine, I have to remind myself to use this very sparingly because for those that have naturally oily hair, this product will make your hair more oily faster than without the product on. For those that share my issues I found that if I put the product on my long ends first and then work the rest to my scalp, it helps make a betterand longer lasting look. Smell is pleasantly mild. bugs don't seem to be attracted to it at least."
547,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells yummy and great for your hair,I am a fan of Carols Daughter Products and this one did not disappoint.  I like the scent but it can be a little overwhelming when you initially saturate your hair.  After a while it smells really good.  It does give my hair extra moisture and I like using it for braidouts instead of just water.  It has some very nourishing ingredients that should help strengthen my hair and does not contain parabens nor silicones which I try to look for now in products.  Great for regular conditioner and everyday use.
548,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great After Conditioning or Refreshing Curls,"Great After Conditioning or Refreshing CurlsThe Black Vanilla fragrance isn't for everyone, a little strong for me. This works well and maintains curls after conditioning,  and refreshing curls before they dry out too much. Not a substitute for a quick fix when your curls get very dry and need deep conditioning. In that case the accompanying Black Vanilla Smoothie applied to cleansed wet hair is essential to restore your dry curls to better condition. THEN this can work its magic on them."

553,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost  my Holy Grail … except for the smell,"Really love what this does for my 2A/3A caucasian hair. I use it after washing/towel drying and get distinct, clumpy curls that are very soft, no stickiness or crunch. I can spray it on dry hair to get decent 2nd, 3rd or even 4th day hair. It really tones down the frizz without making my hair thick and goopy the way so many leave-in conditioners and gels seem to.My only complaint is the scent, which is WAY too strong. It gets lighter as my hair dries, but never really goes away. My husband and my kids have all remarked on it (one daughter said I smell like a ""weird dessert""). I will continue to use it, but I hope they'll come up with a more subtle version."

The smell lasts for a long time as well. It smells like expensive body spray.I sprayed a couple of mists on my braids and it gave my hair a new, fresher look with a shine.

While it does help keep the static/frizz down, it also weighs my hair down a lot.  It feels very heavy & doesn't add any shine.  The smell is interesting.  It reminds me of tanning oil.  Overall it's okay.  I like the way my hair feels the following day after washing it out.  It seems softer & silkier."

I've got pretty dry, brittle hair, especially in the winter and, while this is actually great for styling, it's not so good for moisture because it just kind of sits on your hair.

I usually use a deep conditioning treatment once a week, so this is just a little something extra when I need it.  But the smell alone makes this worth every penny."
571,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for relaxed hair,"I have a pixie cut and my hair is relaxed. My first observation was that this product was watery. I like my leave-in conditioners to have more density because I always set my hair and never blow dry. It did not help with detangling either. My hair was left feeling dry and it lacked luster. Perhaps it might work better for someone with a different texture. The fragrance was nice, but it was the worst leave-in conditioner I've ever used."

663,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,I've requested to return this product as it is not what I expected which is also my fault for not looking closer at the photo and thought it was a conditioning product with a more creamier texture. Turned out to be far too watery and no good for my hair type. Unfortunately after two requests to the seller I have heard nothing back at all and being completely ignored. Absolute disgrace customer service.

I have been obsessed ever since. Not only does it smell lovely and leaves my hair feeling great, , it also helps define my curls.

676,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Leave In Conditioner for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe, Vitamin B5 and Wheat Protein, 8 fl oz",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I'm certain this product works for some people, based on many positive reviews, but it did not work for my hair.This product seems like it would work for thick or coarse hair, or hair that needs a ""sealant"" type of product. The product isn't greasy, but the castor oil in the formula definitely coats the hair. This wasn't a positive thing for my hair type, it made it feel dry and sticky. My fine loose waves are typically slippery and manageable, this product made my hair stick together in clumps, it felt scratchy and sticky.The scent was not what I was expecting either, it has a faint vanilla scent but nothing that blew me away.I will be returning this product, it's just not for my hair type, but if you have coarse hair it might be a great moisture sealant."

0,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on my 3c/4a hair type,"I dont usually write reviews but this product has been amazing for me. I hadn't even finished my first bottle when I purchased another for back up. I still haven't gone through it and I feel like I want to buy more so I always have it! Please read my review if you have similar hair to me!I recently made the decision to transition from relaxed hair to natural again and this product (of course in combination with healthy lifestyle choices, good wash routine, and a few supplements) has greatly impacted the way my hair has grown (I've been using this product consistantly for about a month now):Appearance: it's less frizzy, has a lot of shine, and is growing out quickly. Less breakage and a deeper, richer color.Smell: was not my favorite at first tbh, but I have come to love it, as the product itself works very well on my hair type (3c/4a)Application: feels like a cream and when applied to damp hair, slides through like a warm oil. A little goes a long way and I'm able to work it from root to tip without too much saturation. It detangles my hair as I apply it so I dont need to do any extra combing (this is a literal miracle, I have yet to find a product that can match this detangling power)On Dry Hair: It works best on wet hair. When applied on dry hair, it didnt work as well for me, so I use a different product for refreshing (yall with the same hair are gonna know about using a few different products to achieve different looks). Same brand, the Carol's daughter almond milk leave in conditioning spray is excellent to rehydrate before my next wash day, also it smells beautiful.Overall: If you actually read all that, I'm dead serious. This stuff has been a blessing for me. If you have 3c/4a hair and you are willing, I highly recommend just giving it a shot. Wait it out, you never really know of somthing actually works until you use it consistently for at least 2 weeks! Happy hair journey!"

I thought I was going crazy.....sure enough, there's more perfume in this product than just about anything else. On that note, ""94% less breakage"" is a wildly false claim. Why bother when it's not true; the product doesn't do much. I hate to give such a review to any company striving for natural, vegan, ingredients - but the difference is HONESTY- and I don't see that with this brand, nor the sincere effort it takes to get there."

I blame myself for not looking at the ingredients prior to purchasing but when they say no this no that I wouldn’t think that the second ingredient would be  dimethicone! I put this on my daughters hair and finger comb it into her hair and it felt like I was holding a sheet of sandpaper! It clumped in her hair and in my hands..nope! I threw the bottle away in pure disgust. Don’t show me all of the positive things that the product doesn’t have and turn around and add one of the most awful silicones as #2. I love a few of the other Carol’s daughter products for my daughters hair but this isn’t one!

I seen the difference the first time I used it. I'm 7 months postpartum and somehow my hormones left my hair extremely dry, brittle and all the bad things you can think of. I was using WOW Science coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and somehow my hair did okay but I wasn't really pleased with it. I tried this the first time and wow, unbelievable! It worked and took the extreme dryness way. I bought the shampoo, conditioner, scalp oil and this and I've been using it for 2 days and my hair looks and feels amazing. I plan to get more. I'll hate to run out of this. My hair needed this! I'm very thankful for this product. It smells good and natural to me. I hope the second batch is as good as the first batch."

Now I’m not a Carols daughter fan have only ever tried 3 things from them.  But THIS !!!! Listen it turns your hair into soft defined bouncy curls and it keeps my hair nice and moisturized.  I put it on in the shower after washing out my DC and I put the shower cap back on for 15 mins then I twist my hair.  For my hair I could use this without a styler and I wear my twist for 2 weeks.  Please don’t change the formula it’s perfect.
9,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Contains “Cones”,If your hair is not a fan of “cones” you might want to stay away from this leave-in. There’s  Dimethicone and Amodimethicone and they are not at the very end of the ingredient list. They’re in the top 10.  These “cones” can coat the hair shaft and build up eventually causing breakage if you don’t use a clarifying shampoo regularly.  My mistake for not fully reading the ingredient list. Also contains drying Isopropyl Alcohol...why would anyone want to put drying alcohol on their hair or scalp? Its absorbed into the skin and can cause rashes and itching. I don’t understand that ingredient being in a leave-in hair conditioner. Glad I only paid under $10 for it. It’s already in the trash. :-(

The leave-in creme is my go to for added softness whenever I need to reset my style *and just a little every other night before bed.*  I'm not crazy about the ""woodsy, after a storm"" scent but it's not OVERpowering, especially since I use other styling products.  (If you're not overly sensitive to odd scents, AND I AM, you'll forget all about it after you notice the results.) I will be using the leave-in creme for life!!!"

My hair LOVES this moisturizer i have to use a lot though but i did have less breakage and my hair has grown past my shoulders the longest its been since i was 16 when i had a jerri curl, many moons ago :). I can see why some don't like the scent. it is a unique, sweet scent but i love it and im sensitive to chemical type smells and smells that are too sweet. This is great and I'm buying it again. I just recently relaxed my hair but still wearing twist outs and this makes my hair super soft. Espcecially being newly relaxed on virgin hair and i didnt allow it to process totally so it made my hair a bit dry. This helps a LOT."

This was going to be my best leave in conditioner because it was thick, a great detangler and moisturizer for my hair. After one use, I couldn't get over THE HORRIBLE SMELL!!!!!! I had got a headache and it took days for the scent to finally mellow out. I decided to combat the EXTREMELY HORRIBLE SMELL by mixing it with 3 oils---Tea Tree, Argan and Shea Butter Oil---but, it was all to NO AVAIL.

18,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky and makes hair knotted.,For mine and my daughter's hair are the only thing that this has going on for it is the smell it smells pretty good but as far as performance this is one of my least favorite hair products that I've ever used. Applying it it's sick like a body lotion which is fine if it works but the fact that it doesn't is not okay. My daughter has curled textured hair and it automatically knotted it up upon application and I've tried this more than one time I tried using it on wet hair damp hair on the ends of dry hair and it's still not her hair up to where I came and brush it we have to go spray her hair out usually leave in conditioner so it's back to normal. I have wavy frizzy curly hair and ended the same with mine when my hair dried after leaving the product and it was hard I could not run my fingers through my hair completely not satisfied with this.

I used it once on my hair and it did absotuletely nothing but dry it up. literally sucked the moisture out of my hair which is very ironic. I do not recommend. Google the ingredient and you will see this is not it. Stay away"

It's not just stretching my curls out, either, because they look as defined as before if not better. My boyfriend even noticed a difference.I'm seeing a lot of comments about the smell. I like it, but it has a ginger-y component that I can see being a little much for delicate noses. It pairs really well with coconut.So yeah, 5 stars, will sing its praises even to bald people and if it's ever discontinued I will go into full mourning."

Works okay.,"The leave in conditioner smells horrible as if someone mixed some mint and other chemicals in there. I also don’t like the way my hands feel after putting a small amount of the cream in my hair. greasy. the pump also doesn’t work which I was disappointed for so I have to pat the bottle on my hands several times including to squeeze it afterwards for some of the product to come out.

It detangles and softens my very long straight hair. I’ll give credit where due, it does help get the brush through my hair. But dear god, I simply cannot get over the horrific smell. It has started to make me gag and tear up now when I use it. It is definitely not worth that. It smells very much like very peppery food. It is so gross and even my dog can’t stand the smell. Maybe I got a bad batch but I’ve never bought a hair product that smelled like fermented food before. Seriously, it’s the worst smelling hair product I’ve ever used."

Am in the process of lightening my locs so that I can dye them a lighter color, which is a long process and can damage your hair, so my hair has to be keep moisturized.

Thick consistency but does not weigh down hair. Used on scalp and length,no build up. My hair is about 26 inches long and this nicely coats without weighing down.

I have stick straight hair (Asian/Hispanic/White) that’s pretty heavy and slick.  I have to wear my hair in a bun for work and I was becoming concerned with losing hair because of the required hairstyle.With this product, I don’t even need to use mousse or hairspray.

I’m not usually the type to leave reviews but as soon as I put this leave in on my hair, my hair instantly felt more hydrated and my curls woke up.  My first use was 4 days post wash and i’ve been slacking on my daily moisturizer routine so my hair was pretty dry. I put this on my dry matted hair after wearing a bun for the past 4 days and my hair felt great after wards. Not too thick. Left my hair feeling softer and looking more full than usual.

I don't think that everyone would be too fond of the scent, but I really like it. It reminds me of rosemary, but a little sweeter than that. It makes my hair smell fresh and clean throughout the day, so I really enjoy that. It's the opposite of a scent that'd seem like a musty perfume on your hair. Other than that, its a pretty good leave in, but I don't notice an incredible difference. It's nice to tame and detangle my fine, wavy, frizzy hair without weighing it down too much. I would say that if you want something more moisturizing and with more substance to find another product. This is a simple, lightweight, easy leave in."

252,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never really been brand loyal, but I just might become brand loyal to this conditioner.  It's great.One thing about it that is weird though is the smell.  It smells strongly of ginger and not really that good right out of the bottle, but after my hair dries, I smell my shampoo as much as this conditioner, and the ginger only enhances the smell, so it smells great.  I find that a bit odd, but it works well for me.It is strongly scented, so if you are adverse to strong fragrances, you might want to skip it.  If you get it, and you aren't thrilled with the scent, wait until your hair is dry to really judge it.I have extra fine, aging hair and it really does my hair wonders.  I ONLY use it.  I have just been shampooing my hair and then using about 2 full squirts of this.  My hair is extremely long so most people won't use that much.  Still, I use much, much less of this product than I do of regular conditioner, so the bottle is lasting well and I expect it to last a long time, which makes it a good value.I use it root to tip with the first squirt and work it through, then I put the second squirt only on the lower 2/3 of my hair.  That seems to work well for me.It leaves my hair hydrated, smooth, shiny, and with plenty of body.  My hair takes a curl very easily when I use this.  IF I braid my hair wet after using it, normally my hair looks crimped, but man it looks crazy zig zaggy z-waved. yet smooth after using this!I am noticing less breakage and a ton of shine, yet my hair does not look oily at all and I can go 2-3 days before I feel I need to wash it again."
253,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,Very subtle warm scent. I was pleased with how much I loved this scent as it’s hard to imagine based on the spices. It’s not too spicy of a scent though. It’s soft and pleasing and not too strong. You would smell it if sniffing hair but it wouldn’t smell when you walked into a room or anything and you don’t notice anything beyond when you put it on and first style your hair.Love that it’s a leave in.The consistency is super super thick and creamy.Works great on slightly frizzy hair. Helping over time to smooth out my hair too. I mostly like the added subtle scent though. Makes me feel good that my hair feels nice.Like the easy to use pump dispenser- makes it easier to use when rushing around in the am.Full sized product.Nice looking label.I had previously heard of this brand but never actually tried any of the products. I really love this and would now totally consider buying more from this brand.Overall I’d recommend it.
254,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength leave-in hair conditioner is awesome! First, it smells wonderful! Second, it contains some great ingredients that are sure to strengthen my very long hair. Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil are known to strengthen hair. The ginger in this product stimulates the blood flow to the hair, encouraging more growth. Also, this wonderful formula contains no paraben, petrolatum, mineral oil, or artificial colors, all of which may harm the health of your hair.It really detangled my hair after using, making it a cinch to comb. It is easy to use too. All I did was pump some into my hands, then spread it evenly throughout my hair after shampooing. It really tamed my frizzies without flattening my hair or making it greasy. All of this for a low price! This is an awesome product!"
255,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger","It took me a few uses, but I'm really enjoying this Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger now! Most of the Leave In Conditioners I've  tried have been sprays. This one is more like a lotion. It worried me a bit, because my hair is very fine and gets weighed down by really heavy conditioners. At first, I think I used too much and I did feel like my stick straight hair was pretty limp. However, I've used less since then and have found that my hair still has the body I like.If you're not a fan of scents, here's a quick word of warning. This  Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger has a strong scent. I can't place if it's the Black Seed Oil or Ginger or the mixture of both, but it smells kind of musky, in a way. It's not a bad smell, though and I've come to really like it. Overall, I'm enjoying this Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger and would buy it again!"
256,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I had to use an oil mixed with a leave in conditioner to feel like my hair wasn't dry. With this product, I no longer reach for the oil. It took a step out of my routine that I had been doing for years! It hydrates my hair and makes it feel healthy. I really feel like it restores my hair as claimed.  My hair is very dry and fine and always tangles especially at the ends. I've tried a ton of deep conditioners and not one has ever allowed me to run my fingers through my hair. Until now! My hair stayed soft, frizz-free and detangled for the full 2 days until I had to wash it again after a workout. Even without brushing the following day, I could still run my fingers through my hair."

258,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Leave-In. Awful Dermatitis.,"This did an Amazing job on my hair. One of the few Leave-In conditioners that left me with both moisture AND shine without the greasy or crunchy, stiff curls.HOWEVER, my forehead and cheek dermatitis has flared significantly since use. I'm so glad my dermatologist was able to pinpoint the issue, though it took a few months to resolve. I can't recommend this to anyone with swnsitive, eczema-prone skin."
259,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This leave in conditioner is amazing. First of it has a lot of incredible ingredients that are very good for your hair, such as castor oil, black seed oil and ginger. I personally prefer using leave-in conditioners because quite honestly I am too lazy to wash conditioners out after letting them do their work and a lot of times they leave a residue that feels gross so I prefer to just use on that is meant to be left in, in the first place.This one is just absolutely perfect. For one I really like the scent right out of the bottle, which BTW is a very large bottle at 10oz for $11 a fantastic price. Sadly the scent doesn't last too long, which I would have loved. You don't need a whole lot of the conditioner to apply to your hair, a little bit goes a long way. After you apply it to your wet hair your hair can be brushed easily without any tangles left really. Once your hair is dry it is nice and shiny, feels soft and is just beautiful. You really can't ask for more. If my hair will be stronger after repeat use, well only time will tell but since this is an awesome product I will most definitely find out sooner or later since I have no problem sticking with this product."
260,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it 😍,Im so impressed with this leave in. My go to has been shea moisture castor oil leave in but I usually need a lot or have to add other products to tame the frizz. Just a few pumps of this and my hair in shiny all day. It even works on day two hair for me just to add some moisture if I need it. After applying this I just add some curl cream and kinky curly custard gel to seal then finger coil my whole head and I get the most beautiful curls that look like ya girl curled her hair with heat.  If I’m not styling or going out I just add the leave in and let it dry. Either way its so moisturizing with or without other products. I have high porosity hair and this works perfect. Excited to try other products from this brand.
261,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have long, thick, curly hair, so moisturizing is a must.  I use conditioner in the shower, but I often need a leave-in conditioner afterward for detangling and less frizz/bushiness.I've used products from this company before that I liked, so I was excited to try this leave-in conditioner.  I'm not disappointed!  The bottle is fairly large, so it should last a while - I only need about 3 pumps for my long hair.  The conditioner has a pleasant scent that isn't too strong.  It definitely helps with detangling.  The conditioner is on the thick side, but it doesn't leave my hair looking greasy or weighed down.  In fact, you can't even tell that there's product in my hair because it looks natural, healthy and clean.  My hair has volume and curls, but is tamed and looks great.  This is one of my favorite leave-in conditioners now!"
262,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,wanted to love it,"Ever since my dad died, my hair has been falling out like crazy and just not very healthy. I really wanted to love this leave in conditioner to start healing my hair so I'd have one less tangible reminder of my pain. The conditioner didn't quite do it for me though. The scent was not overly strong but lingered for a long time - which wouldn't be a negative except that I did not care for the scent. Additionally, I didn't feel like this left my hair feeling any softer than just using my traditional routine. It did leave my hair feeling crunchy for about 4 to 6 hours after showering though...and my hair looked limp the entire day when I used this leave in conditioner. The one positive is that the pump dispenser made it not too hard to use with wet and/or slippery hands."

With this product you can’t use too much or your hair will  take forever to dry.  It makes my hair curly and pretty.  I have used many products and this by far gives me the best results.  The smell is sometimes overpowering but does not stink.  This is my first time trying this line and I must say it has good results.  I will try the shampoo and other oils they make.  The only issue I have is with pricing, but it makes my hair manageable so I would purchase again."

I have dry curly hair so a heavy duty conditioner is a must.  This conditioner works ok.  It doesn’t moisturize any better than the normal store brands, but is a decent conditioner.  It is a thick formula.  I like the included pump, but it doesn’t dispense much.  It takes me 3 pumps for my shoulder length hair.  For me the smell is too unpleasant and strong smelling.  I strive to have good smelling clothes and hair, but this doesn’t make the cut.  It is not my favorite and I wouldn’t purchase again."

It was used in combination with another moisturizing loc product.  I like the fragrance.  It has a mild ginger, spicy fragrance.  It would be a nice change for those who may not like fruity or floral scents which many products often have.  It moisturized her hair well and she has been able to go longer without needing it to be re-moisturized.  Her hair looks shiny with no residue.  She has very dry, type 4c hair.  I recommend this product."

It is very moisturizing. We mainly use it for my daughter's hair (she's mixed) and in the picture I posted there's only this leave-in conditioner and a little edge control in her hair to get. It looks nice in her curls and so far has been great as a leave-in and also for combing through her hair.My wife (she's Caucasian) uses it, as well. She has very thick, curly hair and her ends often get very dry. She uses this after her hair is dry that way she can start with a little applied to her ends and decide if she wants to add more."

It has given it a lot of health and life - instead of the constant breakage, I have notice it is getting stronger with each use.Since it is a leave-in product, it's very easy for me to incorporate into my routines. I shower at night and let my hair air-dry, so I work a pump through my hair, then wake up in the morning to see that it did its job.The smell is fine - not overpowering, but light and pleasant. It's a decent price for the size of the bottle, too, so that is a good value. Overall, it's a good product for repairing weak, broken hair. I would recommend overall."

It's a thick serum consistency and is visibly oily on my hair when used, which is why I wouldn't wear it out. I put a couple quarter sized drops on my hand and rub it, then proceed to apply on my hair closer to the scalp. A little goes a long way.So far I'm not really seeing much of a change with the brittleness of my hair even after using it for two weeks. I'll give it another week to see if it actually strengthens my hair then.Scent is mild and tolerable. I'm hoping  to see good results sometime soon."

However....fragrance is awful. It's not only awful but unnecessary. This would smell just fine but no they had to throw fragrance in it. Wish I would have read the ingredients better. I did look over it but guess I missed it. And the amount of fragrance in it is overwhelming and gives me a headache. I was so excited but im seriously upset and will never buy another one of this brands product

It has a sweet, herbal, floral scent that while I find to be very pleasant,  is also very very strong strong. Fortunately I like the scent and I don't mind the strength of it but it is something to be aware of if you are sensitive to smells."
271,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved my hair!,"This product literally saved my hair! I have damaged hair from bleaching and have tried several hair masks and products, and this one has worked the best for the money. Olaplex is nice, but the price tag is not worth it. This product, however, does the same quality of repair to the hair for a fraction of the cost. It leaves my hair soft, strong, and full of moisture all day."
272,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money great for hair,"With caster oil in this conditioner, I was sure the smell would not be the best.  I was right about the smell .  However, this product works really well.  It had a great lather, the next time I used it I used less as it is strong and it was plenty so a little goes a long way. I love that it doesn’t have any harsh ingredients and for my combination  hair this conditioner did wonders! It smoothed out my hair, added much needed moisture and shine! I will buy the shampoo next so that I can have the set."

She said it was heavy with buildup on her hair, but on mine it was looooovely! My mom's hair is thin, and mine is thick 4a/b/c and VERY tangly and frizzy. It detangled sooooo well! And my hair ended up looking full and beautiful after my twist out. It was also left soft and silky. It also seemed to have a bit more stretch than the last twist out with a different product. I will definitely purchase this next time I need more hair product."

A little also goes a long way. I don’t enjoy the fact that there are silicones in this product and ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL. Had I seen alcohol was an ingredient I would not have purchased.  So unnecessary. Why am I paying 10 dollars for a product with a substance that is meant to dry out and cleanse anything it comes into contact with."

But as a leave-in conditioner? That is just not for me. So my review is based on washing it out at the end of the shower. I leaves my old, long, hippy hair untangled and smooth. It is fine. I do  not know the price it sells for and that would be a factor in my buying it again. I like that it is made in the USA and has ingredients that are pronounceable (based on memories from my long-ago chem class)!"

I used this in the shower to detangle and usually I look at my hand and see a LOT of hair but this time there’s 1-2 hairs on my hand!! Way less breakage and my hair feels so soft and moisturized.

I'm getting hand full of hair falling out my hair  in the shower when I wash my hair and when I detangle. I've never seen soooo much of my hair off my head at one time. Each time I touch my hair whether it's to moisturize or prep for wash day I end up with a handful of hair. This is sooooooo disappointing

I have 90% 4c hair, with a small section of 4a hair above my neck. Using the product resulted in more breakage than usual for the 4c hair.  I was not impressed with its performance on the 4a hair.  Also, I did not like the scent at all."

You don't find many hair care products with Black seed oil or castor oil.  I love the scent, but I find that it makes the hair managable and  moisturized.  It's now my go to product, and it's easy to use."

I apply it before I blow dry my hair to help manage frizz and flyaways. My 50+ hair looks shinier, healthier and smoother when I use Carol's Daughter.  If I accidentally apply too much, I have flat hair until I rewash. Be warned that a little goes a long way."

286,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Divine Strength Leave In Conditioner with Castor Oil, Black Seed Oil and Ginger, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Paraben Free, 10 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,False advertising bad ingredients,I heard about this product and figured I’d give it a try while I’m on vacation. Usually I’m on top of these things but because it was suggested and claimed to be natural I gave it a try. Unless you want dry hair and more breakage don’t do it. After reading that this product has rubbing alcohol and other bad chemicals I immediately rinsed this stuff out my hair. It has a similar rubbery consistency as Cantu which is another product loaded with crazy chemicals.

0,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stinky McStinkerson,"I ordered this product based off of how many stars it got. However I didn’t actually read the reviews. I was looking for a cheaper version of It’s a 10 miracle spray. Upon first use I sprayed it in and it had a light almondy smell. Different but not offensive. It didn’t seem to leave hair overly greasy so I was pleased. Unfortunately, as I went on to dry my hair I noticed my hair felt more coarse And straw like than before. Complete opposite of what I need for my damaged hair. Shortly after, within the hour I started noticing a very strong perfume smell. Like strong, strong. Like my grandmothers perfume strong!!! Lucile, is that you?? Anyway, I thought maybe I was crazy so I reverted back to reviews to find I was not the only one who experienced this. I slept in it over night and I swear it’s actually stronger this morning *insert puke emoji*. My 8 year old son who doesn’t always know how to make the most tactful comments went on to tell me my hair smelled really barfy when he hugged me goodbye at school. So yeah...thats a no from me dawg."
1,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worse Conditioner Ever!!!,"UGH! Honestly terrible. I have color treated hair and was looking for a cheaper alternative to other leave ins so after reading the reviews I bought this.1. The smell is awful. Seriously Awful. This smells like the perfume your grandma used to use in the 90s.2. Made my hair MORE DRY. How is that even possible?! I don’t know. Created more tangles than if I were to use no product at all.3. I have pretty sensitive skin, including my scalp. This **** burned. Like I think I need to wash my hair again just to get this stuff out.I wish I had the same experience as others who have given good reviews but unfortunately I did not.Immediately returning."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Has been a hair care staple for as long as I can remember,"I love Carol's Daughters products and this leave in is a constant staple in my hair care. I usually get it at Target but I ran out and didn't feel like running out and was pleasantly surprised to find its even a bit cheaper on Amazon. I have fine, thin hair that is regularly color treated and sometimes heat styled. This is one of the products that keeps my hair healthy, despite the abuse it takes. When I wash my hair, I'll usually spray into damp hair from midlengths to ends so it doesn't weigh down my fine hair at the roots. It really nourishes my hair, keeping it soft, silky, shiny and healthy. I love the smell. At night, I mist my hair from roots to ends and leave in over night. It's a bit more expensive than other drugstore brands, but it's worth the extra money hands down"
3,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dry, Brittle, Frizzy Mess","The leave in felt like I was applying hairspray to my hair. Instead of moisturizing my hair, it made it more dry, brittle, and unmanageable. When I tried to detangle my wet hair with this, it formed clumps of knots as if I applied a styling gel (pic included). And when I tried the leave in with my hair dry, it felt like I had just applied hair spray because it felt stiff and dry (pic included; with the orange shirt). In both pics you can also see how frizzy it made my hair. On top of that, the scent is very overpowering! It smelled like cheap, floral perfume. Not pleasant at all! I obtained a refund for this:/My hair type: dry, bleached, 2a-2c wave/curl pattern"
4,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"No plastic wrap or opening needed, Seems used?!","I am not happy with this product. It came with the cap off, leaking, no plastic around it to know if someone tampered with it or not. Amazon, this is unacceptable, I want my money back. How do I know what is truly in there with not needing to even open it? Very disappointed. The smell is very strong and I am not sure if it is the real product within the container now!"
5,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Strong smell but hair is pretty smooth,"It's true the scent is pretty overwhelming, maybe has alcohol -- you'll want to avoid breathing in any air you sprayed it in. When I first tried this leave in conditioner on dry (not wet/damp) hair, it made the hair feel a little more tacky rather than smooth and moisturized. But it seems to do a pretty good job if I use it on damp hair just after showering. Not tacky/sticky at all and my fingers run through my hair smoothly. The scent also fades quite a lot so you won't notice it so much all the time."
6,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Leave In?,"When I first sprayed this product on my hair, I noticed the smell right away. It's not bad at all, but one can't help but notice the chemical-like smell at the end of the almond note. I used it in combination with a water and oil mixture as well as some flaxseed gel to bring out and define my curl pattern. I did this for several days straight since the leave-in states it's light enough for daily use. I live in a very dry climate, so keeping my hair moisturized is important because my hair dries out quick and feels becomes brittle. I think this leave-in conditioner dried my hair out faster!!! And I would say the butylene glycol, which is the fourth ingredient, is the culprit. It probably contributed to the chemical smell as well. It's unfortunate because finding alcohol-free hair products is comparable to searching for a unicorn. But living in a  dry climate, I really don't need another hair product drying out my hair. Luckily, I bought another leave-in conditioner in unison and it's actually containing the moisture in my hair so much better. So overall, I'd give this product three stars. It doesn't really look (or smell) all that much like a leave-in...at least compared to the ones I've used in the past...but it did help with detangling, the smell was still decent, it was light on my hair with the few days I applied it, and I like that it didn't contain a bunch of harmful ingredients."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like baby powder,"This conditioner has an overwhelming scent, kind of like baby powder or cheap perfume. If you work in an office, it will be noticed. I have a mix of 2c to 3b curls. My hair is thick and on the fine side. The top layer gets frizzy. This conditioner weighs the waves down, does not help the curl formation/clumping AT ALL, helps with frizz minimally, doesn't control the puff look, and leaves a bit of an oily look. People probably think my hair is dirty. When it dries you don't get a softness. You get a coated look, especially on five inch long waves, or long 2c curls. I don't understand all of the good reviews unless this works on a different curl type."

As I'm aging, I'm getting some super wiry, kinked hairs! I picked this up because someone recommended it to me.I also have thick hair, so I have to use more than what the instructions say, but the whole bottle still has lasted over a month. It's not as effective as my usual leave-in (Garnier Fructis).This conditioner has a VERY strong, perfume-y odor. What you're going to mainly smell is the vanilla, with wheat-y undertones. Guess what Play-doh's scent is based off of? :) No, seriously--look it up! It doesn't bother me too much, though anyone sensitive to smells or who doesn't like vanilla will be put off."
9,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,great affordable product!,"I was searching for a new haircare line after using IGK and not being able to keep up on the cost of their products for the time being and stumbled upon this line, I have straight-colored blonde hair and this makes my hair look amazing! I use this after I shower and towel dry my hair, it leaves my tangly hair tangle-free!!"
10,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,NOT GOOD AND GOOD ( READ),"This is a great product for people who have locs or dreads. For my personal hair this product dries my hair out. It does not moisturize my hair I literally only use it for the scent, so kind of like a hair perfume if that makes sense. I try to use it one time I had just washed my hair and I applied it all over my hair , Worst decision ever. It made my hair hard unmanageable and weighed down to the max, basically everything you do not want your hair to feel like.I will only use this on dry hair and the smallest spray ever , about three sprays on my hair far away and that’s it.My boyfriend uses this for his dreads , I use it for scent lol"
11,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The answer to my problems!,"I'm a fan of Carol's Daughters product in general (I have fine wavy hair but lots of it) but hadn't tried this product before.  I've used a similar product by Bumble and Bumble as well as one by Deva Curl.  HOWEVER, THIS product is far superior to any of those more costly items.  This leaves my hair softer and silkier than any other leave-in conditioning product WITHOUT the weightiness and greasy feel of other frizz-fighting serums.  This is my new go-to super frizz fighter this summer.  BUY IT! You'll be very happy you did, just like I am."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Will make your hair dryer than before using!!!,Smells great in bottle but smells like old lady perfume after drying in hair.. Product actually made my hair dryer than it has ever been should've expected since alvohol is like the 4th ingredient!! I don't know if I got a fake product since it had so many good reviews but I looked again before reviewing and suddenly there was quite a few reviews saying it stinks and is drying... BELIEVE THEM!!! only reason I have 3 star is bc I got a refund and didn't have to return and waste my time..I immediately returned the day I got it.
13,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t know why this had bad reviews,"I LOVE and swear by this product! I use the almond milk whole system from Carole’s daughter (shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, and hair mask). I always get complements on how my hair smells. I don’t think it smells like baby powder at all, it’s more of a subtle sweet smell. I get the best rest with it when I use it to help tame my hair in between wash days (basically use it to re wet my hair so I can do something with it), I also use it to tame fly ways and when I go natural it helps give my curls definition and makes them soooooooo smooth and soft! IM ADDICTED TO THIS STUFF! Pro tip: put it in a mister bottle for better application 😄"
14,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,it was recommended by my friend carols daughter.  it works great.,"I've read mixed opinions abt whether or not leave in conditioners are actually good for my hair.  I asked my friend Carol and we were discussing the pros and cons but then her daughter came home and she sweeps the floors and answers the phone at hairousel, a local hair salon which i think is a really clever play on the word ""carousel"" ) ,  and she said it would be a great product so I bought some."
15,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Improved by Mixing it with Water & Olive Oil,"I was a little concerned when after already purchasing three bottles all at once I read the reviews about the scent being too strong “baby powder” and the moisturizing aspect not effective to help create soft hair. But I modified the product before use which helped tremendously with the scent and hopefully with the moisturizing as well. I combined 1/3 water, 1/3 olive oil and 1/3 of the leave in conditioner in a spray bottle to use as a moisturizer in my daughter’s hair. It drastically cut the scent down to a minimum... it is a faint and manageable scent now with more notes of almond milk and less perfumery smell. This product does contain alcohol in the ingredients which I’m guessing is why others have experienced dryness from use. My daughter has 4c black hair, damaged from straightening/relaxers and we’re trying to return back to a natural style so I thought it reasonable to give this product a try. We go through leave-ins like water so the water/olive oil mixture should do well to extend the use and supplement. Too soon to tell final results which is partially why I’m rating this an average three stars (also because of the strong scent) but so far so good. I would recommend only if you are not afraid to experiment."
16,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,The scent is overwhelming,I'm not the type that writes bad reviews but I cant handle the smell of this product.I'm on the hunt for a new leave in for my daughter's curly hair. I have heard great things about this company and decided to give this product a try. Its bad. The while house smells like almonds and baby powder. Even if this was the best product in the entire world I honestly cant handle the scent.
17,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Effective but strongly scented!,"This makes my thin frizzy damaged (too many years of coloring) hair feel softer and smoother. The smell is overpowering when it is first applied (almond vanilla baby powder), but once my hair is blow-dried, the smell is much less intense. I think while the product is effective in softening my hair, the scent would make it all but unusable for someone sensitive to smells or someone who wears perfume and doesn't want a competing scent."
18,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Detangler!,"Oh this product is fantastic! The fragrance is so nice and as my daughter has very thin hair that tangles like a best instantly daily, this really helps to untangle the large tangled area of her hair and makes it easy for both of us. I don’t mind helping to detangle her hair now and I find my patience is stretched a little longer as well. Will continue to purchase this product and also use in my hair."
19,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not great.,"I previously used Carol's Daughter green supreme leave-in and it was AMAZING. Unfortunately that was discontinued so I figured I'd give this a try.After 2 days, my hair felt INCREDIBLY dry. I don't have very dry hair to begin with, it is color processed and I like to use leave in conditioners to make my hair feel smooth and soft. This product literally made my hair feel like straw on the ends. I stopped using it and my hair returned to normal right away. So strange. Will definitely be throwing this product away. Also the smell of it is very overpowering, waaaay too strong of an almond scent for me. Pretty disappointed overall!"

We have natural hair and use as a daily detangling, softening and conditioning spray before combing out.  Funny thing is I received a compliment from a biker 🚴‍♀️ as I was walking 🚶🏾‍♀️..... I love the smell you have on.  I could smell it from back there.  I was like okkkkkrrrrrr let’s get more."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This Stuff,"Cant find this in stores anymore. They only sale the yucky Vanilla scent. This scent is fresh and clean. I have received many compliments on my perfume, and I have had to explain to people that I am not wearing any perfume.... that its my leave in conditioner that they are smelling. Sometimes a lady have smelled my hair after I explained that, and she would say, ""Yep, that's what I was smelling""Its great at detangling also, in case anyone was wondering."

I think its geared towards ethnic hair,.which i dont have but i do have naturally curly frizzg dry hair and ive tried SO many different products and none work as well as this!!

23,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It smells awesome and makes my hair super soft and easy to comb and manage but...,"I find every time I use this product I get dandruff especially if I use a generous amount. It may just be my hair, but I notice I have to be careful not to put too much. Besides that, it worked wonders for my hair. My hair is softer and easier to manage and I don't get knots anymore when I do use this product. My hair has grown fuller and longer since I first started using this a few months ago. So the pros definitely outweigh that one con."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Leave in conditioner???,This stuff should be labeled as hair spray! It made my sons hair stiff. The cheap stuff for white people's hair works better on his hair than this stuff. His hair is type 3. Poor kid has to go to school like this now because it's too late to wash it out!
25,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,If ain't broke...,"I'm sorry to be late with this review. Because being mixed like me you need a little help with maintenance. So, the spray is liquid gold and I normally get up first thing in the morning; spraying my whole head. Then brush and finish getting ready for the day."
26,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it.,"I decided to purchase this because of all the great reviews, and looked over the ones that talked about the scent. However, I shouldn't have because the scent is WAYYYYY too strong. It honestly smells like overdone old lady perfume and baby powder. I had hoped it would just be a fresh and pleasant scent but it was not. This product also did nothing for my hair? I was hoping it would leave my hair soft and hydrated but there is literally no difference in how my hair looks. So all you buy is old lady perfume for your hair that has no hydration. Not worth the money."
27,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,I was hoping that this product would keep my very fine hair soft and silky like it is right after washing and conditioning for between washings but it’s left it limp and lifeless. I’m so disappointed. Not sure it’s necessarily this specific product or just that no spray on conditioner will meet my expectations!
28,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Works well but don’t expect a great scent,Loved the effect but the smell is not great. Some people may like it because it would be very neutral of a scent and and not flowery or sweet smelling. My daughter and I have thick brittle hair and we both use leave in conditioner after every hair wash and after the pool. I have always used natural products and this works well without being greasy. It left her hair shiny and smooth.
29,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It dries and tangles up your hair,I ordered this item because I researched “the best leave-in products for damaged hair” and this came up. On the instructions says apply on damped hair or dried hair. I tried this product on both ways and it’s the worst product ever! After using it my hair was super dry and tangled up ( it says it’s also a detangle)I do not recommend this product at all!
30,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great smell and works as a detangler for both my daughter and me!,"I love this product, it has a nice sturdy almond smell. While I don’t have people smelling my hair—my 5 y/o with long Caucasian hair that’s thin and wavy used this as a detangler—tells me her friends always tell her how nice her hair smells! I have bought many bottles and for now, it also seems to be avail at Walmart for about the same price—but I love/prefer ordering my staple items on amazon so I know they are there when I need them! Great product that does what it says and more!"
31,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do Not Purchase!,"I use other Carol's Daughter almond milk products and love them. The Almond Milk Leave-In Conditioner is absolutely terrible. At first contact, my hair immediately began to dry and become brittle. I had to wash this leave-in conditioner out of my hair immediately to save it from breaking all over.  I threw the bottle away immediately."
32,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Leave-In!,"I've always loved this product, but I go through it so fast, so I bought a mist spray bottle. It doubles the lasting time of the bottle and goes on much more evenly.I'm bi-racial with 3B/C hair."
33,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite!,I love this product the best one I have found and at an affordable price. You can put it on wet or dry and it really makes a difference if you have dry or curly hair. I don't even bother straightening anymore just spray it down brush it out and it stays soft and curly no more frizzy mess.
34,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love It..,"I love it, and the kids love it!

35,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great!,"I like this leave-in conditioner. The scent is a little strong when you first put it on, but, by the time you walk out the door, you don’t even notice it anymore. My hair is dry from coloring, and it’s helping improve the texture."
36,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ehhhhh...,"It isn’t the worst I’ve tried, but it’s only after I completely soak my hair does it feel like it’s kind of working.The smell is absolutely too much and reminds me of the perfume my grandmother used to wear. It lingers for the entire day and it’s just not very pleasant.I’m still on the search for a good leave in conditioner after Aveeno broke my heart, so I think I’m going to keep looking."
37,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,This is such a nice leave in conditioner! My hair and scalp is pretty normal so I can't speak to other conditions but I use this daily and I haven't noticed any kind of build up. It's not greasy. It's lightweight and smells amazing. This is my second bottle and I will continue to use it as long as it's available. Would highly recommend to anyone.
38,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst,Absolutely the worse product I’ve ever tried on my daughter’s hair. It leaves her hair feeling extremely dry and like it’s just going to break off if I even touch it. The smell is overwhelming and honestly makes me sick. I was recommended this product for my daughters naturally curly low-normal porosity hair and I regret ever purchasing it.
39,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smell is overpowering, but my hair has never been softer","I suffer from migraines so I can only use the product when I’m wearing my hair up away from my face, but it works incredibly.

40,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Intoxicating Scent,"I don't know if this is doing what it's supposed to do but I love the scent and the feel, but not sure if it works yet. I will update this in a month to let you know if my hair improved.  I was deeply saddened though that it arrived so days late without so much as a shoulder shrug."
41,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite,Oh my God I love this Product. It has grown my hair so much allowing me to just stylet in a bun or a ponytail. It keeps my hair soft and detangled. I started by almost everything on this product line it is truly amazing.
42,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy if you are at all sensitive to strong scents,"I don't usually have strong reactions to smells/scents but this stuff made me so sick to my stomach!Immediately after applying the product, I noticed it had a weird smell but didn't think much of it. I went to sleep with it in my hair. When I woke up the next morning, I felt absolutely terrible and spent the whole day throwing up. I didn't get better until I eradicated any trace of the smell from myself, my pillow, and the bathroom. The smell turned very chemically and burned my nostrils every time I got a trace whiff of it. It didn't do anything useful for my hair either..."
43,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my locs.,I purchased the  almond milk leave in conditioner for my locs and I love it.  This product does its job without making my hair feel weighed down and it doesn't leave my hair feeling like there's a thin film over it like other leave ins had my hair feeling in the past. I will gladly purchase this again.
44,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage,This literally ruined my hair. I hard to deep condition my hair for a week just to get it back to normal. I saw online how highly recommended this product was for dry hair and it made mine so much worse. Other comments lead me to believe that this particular product was a knock off.
45,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Better used on wet hair than dry,"I like this product. The bottle says that you can put it on wet or dry hair. I tried it on dry hair and it didn’t take very well. It made my hair frizzy and dry. When I used it on wet hair, it worked great. I believe leave in conditioner should always be used on wet hair (for natural/African American hair) ."
46,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,If only it could smell better.,Definitely helps me untangle my hair which is awesome because instead of taking 15-20 minutes to brush it it takes like 3 min seriously.  Only thing the bothers me is the smell it’s horrible omg gross kinda wishing after this bottle maybe I can find something similar with a better smell I don’t know if I’ll purchase it again solemnly for that reason only.
47,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,works great on me and my daugter's hair,"As with all hair products, results vary based on hair type.

Carol's Daughter is great for us!"
48,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,If you are sensitive to scent don’t buy,This is literally the most scented product I have ever purchased. It’s kind of sad because I like the smell initially it’s a good smell but it’s literally like dipping your entire head in perfume. It is so strong it gags me and lingers throughout the whole house. Also not very moisturizing.

52,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Overpowering fragrance...,"This was a good conditioner but I seldom used it because the fragrance is just wayyyyyy too strong. Not unpleasant, but incredibly potent almond oil smell. I had to give it away. I don't wash my hair everyday and keeping this fragrance in my hair was TOO much. I do have another product from CD but I would not purchase from the Almond Milk range again bc of the scent."

With this livin conditionser it was very liquidly no thickness and not much curls after I  used it.

58,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,My husband hates it too.,"This is the most overwhelming scent. I wasn't expecting that. I expected something like, idk, almonds or milk. What you get is grandmas perfume. And baby powder. Like a ton of baby powder. I put it in my hair wet and now that it's dry the smell hasn't faded at all. Apple cider vinegar rinses leave less of a scent and more softness than this. I'm disappointed to say the least. My hair looks and feels nice but my head is pounding, I'll have to wash it out."
59,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh!,I prefer the Black Vanilla Leave-in.

60,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my hair stiff,"The smell is wonderful, but t makes my hair stiff and therefore MORE frizzy looking because the baby hairs stick out straight and stiff from the rest of my hair. I have very long hair and I can barely get a brush through it after using. Now, my Son is 2 and this is great to spritz on his curls to freshen his boy smell between washing. So, not great for me as a conditioner."

277,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While I am generally not picky about conditioners, using inexpensive brands or what is on sale, etc. I have to say, this is really nice.  The ingredient list is a little different than most, in a good way.  While it contains the usual mix of chemical compounds, it starts with aloe, followed not too far down the list by shea butter.Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Calendula Officinalis Extract, Carbomer, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein/PVP, Crosspolymer, Lactic Acid, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Panthenol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PEG-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Polyquaternium-11, Polyquaternium-7, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Sorbate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Seed Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Retinyl Palmitate, Silicone Quaternium-3, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Trideceth-12, Trimethylsilylamodimethicone, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Fragrance (Parfum).The conditioner has a delicate scent, and goes into the hair nicely.  You do not need to use a lot.  It does not make hair look greasy when applied either.  If anything, it  made my hair and my wife's look a little dryer the first time or of use. I suppose that is a detractor, depending on your hair type.  If your hair is fine and/or oily, like mine, you probably will like this conditioner more so than other hair types.  After a use or two, it added a gentle sheen to my hair.  After a few uses, my hair showed more ""life.  My wife, who has medium fine hair, but more dry than mine, likes the conditioner as well, and I can see the added bounce and shine on her tresses.I even put a small dab on my arms and hands and rub it in.  It has a nice, smoothing, moisturizing effect.I know many reviews mention a strong scent.  The bottle I have is not strong at all - in fact it is a faint scent.Overall, I really like this conditioner.  Again, I am not a huge fan of conditioners, but this one does seem to add bounce and sheen to hair."
278,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"The Carol and Daughter Almond Milk Leave in Conditioner worked very effectively on my past shoulder length, dry, Asian hair.  Because my hair is so porous, some leave in conditioners leave my hair heavy feeling and oily.  This conditioner worked fantastically at conditioning my hair without making it heavy, oily looking, or frizzy.  The conditioner absorbed very well into my hair and left my hair feeling so soft and manageable.  I sprayed on the conditioner while my hair was wet and blow dried it with great results.  My hair looked healthy and shiny without looking overly glossy, and I couldn't stop playing with my hair throughout the day - it felt so soft!While I like the leave in conditioner because of the softening effect it had on my hair, I can't say that I'm in love with the sheer strength of the scent of this product.  The scent of this leave in conditioner is pleasant, but is really strong!  Even after my hair was dry, throughout the day I would get a whiff of the almond baby powderesque scent when I'd turn my head.  Now, if I could smell the conditioner, I'm fairly sure that other people could easily smell me from afar.  When first applied on wet hair, the scent was even stronger.  It wasn't so overbearing that I felt like I sprayed myself in the face with perfume, but it was still not pleasant to smell while my hair was wet.  The lingering scent was not a dealbreaker for me as I didn't mind getting a soft whiff of almonds every now and then throughout the day, but I'm quite sure not everyone will be thrilled to have a lingering scent clinging to them all day.  If you don't enjoy strong scents, this product is NOT for you.Overall, this Leave in Conditioner worked very well for my hair.  It made my hair soft, manageable, and very smooth without weighing it down, but the scent was a bit overbearing, particularly when my hair was wet.  If this was made in a lighter scent, this Leave in Conditioner would be 5 stars...unfortunately, the smell is just too much of a good thing."
279,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a nice conditioner that you don't have to wash out, but you may want to wash out anyway.  Here's why:  although it leaves your hair nice and soft, you will be leaving a trail of scent behind yourself for hours after application.And I say that as someone with almost no sense of smell.  I could smell this conditioner for hours after application.  It wasn't and unpleasant aroma, but other people may not have liked it as much as I did.  So I felt kind of self-conscious walking around with this aroma wafting after me.  After all we live in a world where many people are allergic to, or intolerant of, scent.  So, this should be tried with caution."
280,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving this item 2 stars to be fairL my daughter has used it and seemed to think it was ok--nothing miraculous or anything like that as far as its conditioning properties. I have dry, thick wavy hair (not processed in anyway, I'm just getting older) that I do blow dry. Plus I live in Alabama where the weather is hot and humid. I found that this had the opposite effect from what is promised: my hair was dryer, and much more ""webby"" (sort of how my hair gets in the worst humidity, tangly, and difficult to manage) than usual with this. It certainly didn't feel soft, but felt sticky! The smell is initially pleasant, but having it on my hair all day, it became cloying and annoying. And when I washed my hair the next morning, the smell lingered for another 24 hours or so.Perhaps this works for some hair, but it does nothing positive for me."
281,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"this leave in conditioner is easy to use. sprayed on damp hair, it is an effective detangler. sprayed on both dry and damp hair, it does provide some softness and moisture to dry, over processed hair. My hair is fine and color treated and is frequently subjected to heat from dryers and curling irons. This did leave it feeling soft and looking healthy. However it didn't do much to refresh my style and the fragrance is strong. It is not an unpleasant aroma, sweet like baby powder and light musk, but not my favorite. It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free. I appreciate the exclusion of mineral oil, petrolaltum or artificial coloring. It is an effective product that provides relief to stressed locks."

Granted, I still did my regular post washed hair routine, however the softness and stability of my hair is definitely great! It took care of most of my frizziness - something I have only seen with the Aveda Curl Shampoo and Conditioner set.Make sure to continue to do the pre (oiled hair for a couple hours) and post wash (Moroccan oil curl enhancer) routine for your curly hair and this conditioner will definitely enhance and defrizz curly hair."
283,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,I really hope the company sees this review,"I think they switched the formula. I used carols daughters early last year in 2020 and it was amazing and it smelled nice. However, I had to stop buying their products bc of the strong chemical-like smell that's being masked by overwhelming perfume.I was so disappointed because I bought a whole bottle and was in the middle of doing my hair and I could not bring myself to even use it for the sake of my wash day routine.... I believe the other reviews when they say it smells bad."
284,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hm..,"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews, but then I don't know much about hair products. I usually don't leave reviews but felt it was worth it because I am 30 years old and this is the first hair product of which I have ever finished the entire bottle (besides basic shampoo and conditioner of which I just get whatever is on sale). Not only that, but I can't find it in-store so I came here to order more. I never noticed a problem with the scent and it doesn't seem strong to me. My hair tangles immediately so I have to slather it in spray on conditioner while wet or regular conditioner in the shower and spend forever brushing it out. If I don't do so it takes 5x as long and hurts (I am aware you're not supposed to brush your hair out wet, but the potential damage is well worth it to me). This has been the best product I've ever used for doing so. I let my hair air dry and never put anything else on it, and this makes my hair dry and look better than after using any other product to air dry it."
285,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product overall, but the scent for me is associated with a diaper change, and it's not a pleasant scent :-(","I really want to like this product, because I like the company and it's mission and quality.  However, the fragrance of this product makes it impossible for me to want to use.  I've tried it about three times now, and it's very light and offers some nice texture.  But the fragrance is some sort of baby powder... now if you have not had children, this may be a pleasant smell for you, but for me, the association of this scent is that of diaper change/diaper pail.  I used it a few times to see if I would drop the association and it wouldn't bother me, but it didn't go away I am sorry to say.  Ironically, it is probably the natural sensibility of the ingredients that makes the association so strong.  If they were to make this product with another scent, I would definitely give it a try."
286,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My granddaughter has extremely curly hair. It's at least a 3B, with some sections more like 3C. It takes her a long time to comb through it before and after her shower. I try to keep a supply of hair products on hand for when she spends weekends with me. Most of the products I buy don't do much for her hair. We were anxious to see how well Carols Daughter would work. We both like the scent of the leave-in conditioner, it's a strong almond scent. The bottle sprays well without clogging. While this spray didn't work miracles, it did make it easier to get the comb through. Her hair also feels softer with it. It's much better than most of the leave-in conditioners we've tried. This is something we would buy when this bottle runs out."
287,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wife's review- I have thin, fine, color-treated (damaged), wavy hair that I straighten. My daughter has fine, thin, super curly hair. We live in the humid south, & frizz is a constant issue. I put this in my hair after washing while it's still wet & then dry it. It seems to help protect from heat damage & keeps the frizz down. I spray it in my daughter's hair dry just so I can get a brush through the tangles. Once it dries, you can't tell there's product in her hair and the curls form perfect ringlets. It smells nice, too. I have never tried Carol's Daughter brand before, but I'll be buying this again. Other reviewers mentioned that it made their hair brittle & dry- My experience has been the opposite."
288,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally thought this was a decent leave in after the first few uses, but quickly found that it stared to dry out my hair the more I used it. There seems to be a lot of protein ingredients in it, along with Shea butter, which is just an altogether bad combo for my fine, color treated hair. I wouldn’t suggest using this unless you have already moisturized hair, and know your hair responds well to protein. It smells nice, but ultimately wreaked havoc on my hair even just from a single week of use. I wish I hadn’t bothered with it, and spent my money on something else."

Even my husband loves the scent of my hair when I use this.  I am brunette, my hair is not color treated and is naturally quite shiny.  I have very fine hair but I have lots of it.  Aside from the scent, I don't realize notice much of a difference in my hair's performance when I use this.  My hair is slightly wavy & it wear it in numerous styles---natural, blown out, texturized, straightened with a flat iron, curled, you name it and no matter what style I choose I just don't notice much of a difference here. But that smell....I can't say I won't buy this again for the scent alone."
290,"Carol’s Daughter Almond Milk Leave In Conditioner with Almond Milk, Aloe Butter and Shea Oil for Extremely Damaged Hair, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pleasant to smell, effective leave-in conditioner spray. My hair, personally, tends toward oily rather than dry, but as the 'designated brusher' of a teenage girl's hair before events where she needs to be 'presentable' (or when she's lazy or just in the mood to have someone else do the work), I can attest to how much easier it is to work with hair once it's been so conditioned. Occasionally a detangler is required if it's a right squirrel nest to start with, but usually that is not the case. In my sort of low-intensity\low-need hair care requirement\experience, this is deemed a good product, and I fully endorse its use."

My only quibble, and it is completely personal, is that it's a bit heavy for my particular hair (on the oily side).  In all fairness, this product is intended for over-processed, extremely damaged hair.  Like I said, I try them all.  I am in my 60s, long thick hair (thought not nearly as thick as it once was), never been dyed, in pretty good condition overall - so I'm not the target market.  I do love the scent though."

My hair is color processed, but fairly healthy. I do get some hair that looks a little dry on the ends. I put a little of this on dry hair and it immediately smoothed the hair and make it look great. I took off one star because the scent is strong. I like baby powder scent, so that doesn't bother me. But this scent lingers a long time and is a little too strong.

I have oily hair that has some damage and is fine. I use conditioner every day. I will admit that I was a little concerned that this product would make my hair oily. It does not at all!The product is easy to use. All you do is hold it about 6 inches from your head and spray. Then, you are good to go. It definitely saves me a few minutes in the morning since I do not have to lather it into my hair and then wait and then rinse it out like regular conditioner. The only downside to this product is that the scent is quite strong. It smells like a strong perfume. I don't love it, but most of the smell fades quickly. It may be tough for people with allergies. The leave-in conditioner does make my hair easy to brush and incredibly soft. I think it helps to improve the little bit of damage that my hair has also.Overall, I really like this product. It makes my hair feel and look great. It doesn't smell the best, but isn't too bad once it fades some. I would recommend giving it a try."

I have been using this for about a week now to truly test it out and honestly... if I could rewind a week ago I would. It REEKS of baby powder, and does nothing for my hair.

0,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Does NOT help with detangling,I'm not sure I have ever seen a leave in conditioner that does not help with the detangling process but this one did NOT. Least not for me. I am black and I have used other Carol's Daughter products and have good results with them but this ... I was so mad after spending almost 10 mins (felt like an hour) trying to comb through my hair and running into tangles. I will never buy this again and can not recommend it - at all!!!! It was the worst leave in conditioner I have ever used. And to be honest it costs way too much to be this awful of a product

The smell is amazing.  I smell my hair all day long.  This is by far the best leave in conditioner shine spray I have tried.  It is NOT greasy and doesn’t make my hair limp.  I have tried many from salons,  ulta you name it.You will love this ! I put it on wet hair when I get out of shower.  Controls my frizz and makes my hair so soft.  I also use on dry bed head  .i have long hair past my chest.  You will love this !!"

My hair fell out due to a stylist wrongly overprocessing my hair. I left that stylist, found another, and only recently visited my new stylist due to the pandemic. With the aid  of the monoi products, my hair  is shoulder length. I must add that I also use a bit of cream-based oil, and I wash my hair on a regular basus."

Dried my hair out,Very disappointed in this leave in. I love the whole line of moni carols daughter. But i had never tried the leave in. I use it on my deep wave brazilian weave. It totally dried the hair out with no moisture at all. I wonder of this was truly made by the product line or has been altered by the seller. I only say this because all of moni’s products are wonderful. So im not sure of this product is true to its ingredients or been altered

6,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Favorite, light weight",This is a favorite of mine that I have used for a while. I used the shampoo and conditioner when I was having a lot of breakage. I was happy to see a Monoi leave in conditioner. I don't put a lot of chemicals in my hair but I make an exception for this. I lightly spray my hair (locs) about 2 -3 times per week. This oil is light. It doesn't leave any sticky residue. My hair is just soft with a very light scent which dissipates quickly.

8,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed,I was so excited to receive this and unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.  It is almost water.  There seems to be little to no conditioners in it.  I understand it is a leave in product but even at those standards I feel is does not have enough actual conditioner in it. It is basically a fragrance for your hair. And I was not that crazy about the fragrance.  Very over priced for what you get.

40,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The design and packaging of the spray bottle looks promising. Ingredients and instructions are clearing stated for its purpose which is repairing our hairs. It did that, but not a full pleasant process in my experience.I am not a stranger to leave-in hair treatments or conditioners.  I have used a few brands in the market in the past 5 years because my hairs are naturally thin and dry. I need leave-in conditioner to protect my hairs under the brutal sun and this product achieved that. I tried it for 2 days and it kept my hairs moist and shine under the sun and my hairs could be combed and styled easily after my sleep without shampooing and hairdryer. That preserve the natural oil for my scalp and no unnecessary heat torture for my hairs in the morning. It also saved me time and money.  My hairs look healthier due to the added shiny layer and they also seem to be more straight than usual and I am happy with that.However, the scent from this leave-in conditioner is a little funky. I guess it is a either you love it or hate it thing. I was pleasant in the beginning, but it lingered all day and it made me feel annoyed by it. Also, my coworkers in office could pick up the scent near by easily and they kept asking what was that smell. It doesn’t stink or anything, but it doesn’t make me feel comfortable that people know that it is on my hairs. I am still using it, but I will only use it on stay home weekends and staycations."
41,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I had really high hopes for this product. I typically use a professional quality leave-in conditioner, but I have used more affordable leave-in conditioners in the past so I can make a fair comparison. This product feels like it should cost half the asking price of $19.The first thing that stands out about this product is the awful smell. It's horrible. I use this on wet hair and the smell stays noticeable until my hair dries. Once dry, I don't notice the scent anymore. Once you get over the smell, the product just doesn't stand up to the claims that it makes. It states that it will detangle hair, and add shine, softness, and manageability. It doesn't detangle at all. It does add shine, but it's greasy and if you touch your hair, the product comes off on your hands even after hours. As far as adding manageability to my hair, it seemed to hold heat styling for longer with this product, but I had to clean my straightener and curling iron after using them when I had this product on my hair.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this. It doesn't detangle, it adds grease and weight to hair, and it makes your styling tools filthy."
42,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I generally like this brand, but this was a bit of a miss for me. It smells great, but it did little in the way of moisturizing my thick-but-fine, tangle-prone, dry blonde hair. I tried it after my shower with nothing else; it didn't help me get through the tangles at all, and my hair air-dried a bit frizzy and dry looking. I tried it before my usual styling product, and the results were no different than if I had just used my stuff alone. I did find that it works well as a shine spray, or as an extra dose of moisture, on dry hair. It doesn't make a lot of difference, but it does impart a nice scent, makes my hair look shinier, and makes it feel slicker (and less tangle prone), at least for a couple of hours (I was back to tangles by day's end).For some reason it seems like this product doesn't penetrate my hair properly; it seems to just sit on it until it dries up. That makes it a nice finishing product, but not a good leave-in (at all) for me."
43,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very nice leave in conditioner. It can be applied to wet hair as a detangler or to dry hair to refresh your hair. I usually use it after I showered and I have to admit, this made my hair feel amazing. I brushed right through it without a tangle in sight! It also has a very pleasant scent that I just can't identify what it smells like, so it must be that monoi oil since I am not sure what that would smell like, but I REALLY like it a lot. The smell lingers for a bit and I wouldn't mind smelling it for a lot longer than it did.Once my hair was dry it looked beautiful. It was nice and shiny, did not look greasy, heavy or limp. I was very happy with how it looked and felt, very nice and soft just the way I like it. You don't need a lot of it either which is great since it isn't the cheapest, but also not the most expensive product I own.Fantastic product that I am very happy I found and will be repeat purchasing!"
44,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For years I have bleached my hair and because of this I have very damaged and dry split ends. I have to apply a leave in conditioner every time I take a shower because if I don't I can't even run my brush through my hair. This is a decent leave in hair conditioner that untangles my hair and helps it feel more soft and manageable. It gives my hair a little shine and what I love most about it is the smell it leaves behind, even after my hair has dried.I have used many leave in hair conditioners over the years and find this one to be pretty good.  This isn't as effective as some of the higher priced brands but his fair for the price. I do notice that this leaves my hair feeling like a bit of residue is Left Behind when I use it though so make sure to only use a little bit."
45,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing!!,"I have used the monoi shampoo and conditioner from Carol's daughter for over 6 years and it makes my fine long straight hair feel so smooth and shiny. The smell is absolutely stunning, coconut and Jasmine flowers. I was so excited to get a chance to try this. It is a unique product, a cross between detangler, leave in treatment, and hair oil. It smells exactly like the shampoo and conditioner. I use it every morning to style my hair without the greasy buildup. The sprayer makes it easy to use, and if you don't do much with your hair other than brush it out and put it up, this is a Time saver since it smoothes your hair and makes your hair look more sleek and put together by sleeking and smoothing flyaways. I'll be using this to the last drop. Will definitely be getting more in the future."

Here is her experience with this conditioner:Sometimes being on different medications it will affect and damage your hair by weakening it and making it brittle. After a long barrage of them, this had happened to me. So I was hoping that using Carol’s Daughter Monoi Leave-in Conditioner would help. I know that nothing is a 100 percent cure but it did help make it softer and shinier. I like that you could use it on your hair whether it is wet or dry, I will say that I was concerned when I first sprayed it on dry hair it did have a greasy look until it dried and was very soft. I will continue to use the product long enough to verify whether there is an improvement or not."

The fragrant may just be the culprit, it is 4th in ingredients and super perfume-y (fragrant is also listed again towards end as well).. It did make the frizzy tamed down without needing a lot and gave my hair (caucasian hair) a smooth shiny look so if strong fragrant product isn’t an issue for you, you may like this.Not recommend for those that get sinus migraines from strong perfume/chemical smells.."
48,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Carol’s Daughter Monoi leave-in conditioner works well. I have dry, over-processed, frizzy hair, and it really smoothed out the frizzies and helped to make my hair look tamer and less dry. It did also seem to make it stronger. This is just what I was looking for. Instead of silicones, there are oils in here, such as Tiare Gardenia flower, monoi oil, and Coconut Oil to hydrate and condition the hair. There is also wheat protein and vitamin B5 to strengthen and nourish it. This does not feel greasy or oily. There is no petrolatum, mineral oil, or artificial color. All I do is spray it on my hair when needed, and comb through. I did not notice any scent in this product."

The scent alone will have you coming back for more. I have dry, damaged, color treated, long hair and this is uhmazing! I spray on when my hair is damp and it keeps everything feeling and looking so much more healthy, especially the ends! My hair is softer and more manageable now. I also spray on when my hair is dry when I feel like I need just a little bit of moisture and to freshen up. This is an amazing product that I will definitely purchase again! Great stuff"
50,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,First unfortunately the bottle leaked during delivery. It was all over the inside of the package. Be careful when you open it. I love the product. It smells great (like gardenia lotion). I love how I can spray it on my hair in the morning and still smell it on there when I go to bed at night. I've been using it for several weeks and my hair seems softer and healthier than when I started with it. I just spray a couple of times after my shower and then massage it in. My hair is not all tangled up and i can run a brush through it easily then. I only use a little bit each time so I'm guessing this will last me a long time. Very happy about that!
51,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I'm torn about this review.  I LOVE Carol's Daughter products.  I really do.  But it is very hard to determine if this product does all that it claims after just a few uses AND not using it with other brands products.  I love leave-in conditioners.  When I applied this it was like other spray leave-ins.  Easy to apply and moisturized my hair.  As far as the repair and al the other claims, I'm just not sure.  I wouldn't not use it.  It did seem to add moisture to my natural 4-something type hair.  What I liked is that my hair felt moisturized AND I didn't have to have the ENTIRE product line to feel it.  Thank you."
52,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I received an 8 ounce bottle of Carols daughters, leave in conditioner. The Leave-In Conditioner is supposed to add strength and restore natural moisture to your hair. The product contains a blend of the Tiare Gardenia Flower and Coprah Coconut Oil - plus Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5. Directions -Hold bottle 6-8 inches from hair and spray all over. Use on wet or dry hair to help detangle. Use on dry hair to refresh style. Don't rinse out. The conditioner smells like an overwhelming strong perfume. I am not fond of the smell. The conditioner is also a bit sticky. Overall, it's ok."

I've used it repeatedly over the past few weeks and it's been working well as a leave in conditioner. It helps so much with tangles and it leaves my hair with a nice healthy shine. It has so many natural ingredients and none of those damaging ones in so many other products. It seems to be working great and it smells delightful as well. I recommend it if you are looking for a good leave in conditioner that adds a little boost to your hair and makes it look refreshed and renewed.
54,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This is by far the WORST leave-in conditioner I have EVER used! My hair is fine and I normally don't need a lot of conditioner to make it feel smooth and silky and to detangle so I was shocked when I first sprayed on this conditioner and could feel my hair getting drier and tougher and actually feeling brittle, like hay. The scent is terrible as well. It was so bad that I thought it must be my imagination so I tried again and nope. IT IS AWFUL!  My hair would have felt better using nothing at all! Awful. Just...awful."
55,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Success depends on the hair cut. Adds body and texture. Smells nice.,"This would probably work well with a short layered  boyish hair style because it does add body and texture. My hair is fine, thick, and currently cut in a mid-neck length bob and it needs to be smooth and silky. After shampooing and wrapping my hair in a towel for about ten minutes I applied the product. I was pleased with it at that point because it made my hair easy to comb the tangles out of. But once dry I knew that this leave-in conditioner isn't right for my hair right now. The scent is nice."
56,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really like Carols daughter products so when I seen a leave in conditioner I was super excited! This product has a light smell not too strong and powerful but it does leave a good scent behind. I washed my hair a few times and sprayed this in afterwards. I was able to run my fingers through my hair better and it didn’t leave a greasy shine behind like some leave in conditioners do. Also great price sometimes these products tend to be expensive so this was a steal.
57,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,I did not like the scent,This leave in conditioner is really nice - and detangles my hair really well. However I think the scent is overwhelming and somewhat old fashion - I am not a big fan of it.The spray is working really well to refresh second day hair. The sprayer is really good too and has a fine mist.The price is good. The only thing I wish that the scent was different or that is was fragrance free. It is hard to describe the scent but I am not liking it.

The scent is very warm and pleasant and the scent lingers. It's a pleasant experience."

In fact I found it made my hair a bit stiff so it was harder to untangle my hair.  It was weird.  It left my hands and hair feeling sticky.  I had to apply another leave in conditioner before I was able to untangle my hair."
60,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repairing Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil, Wheat Protein and Pro-Vitamin B5, 8 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,not great for fine hair,"This is a solid leave-in conditioner that will condition your hair and make it look shiny.  However, it's not great for fine hair like mine because it weighs it down.  Also, I like hair products that smell like herbal essence products.  Although this smells good, it doesn't compare to herbal essence."

This product works best for me as a hair tamer. I brush my long curly clean hair out, spray on, and then brush through it tames the fly-aways without leaving a stiff hairspray feel. I didn't find the scent at all memorable nor did it detangle my hair (luckily I had rinse out conditioner for that). It did not leave my hair dry or brittle but it didn't make it any softer either."

12,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repair and Moisture for Curly Hair Monoi Star Strength Leave In Cream with Monoi Oil for Hydration and Softness, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This leave in conditioner is wonderful. I have long thick curly hair, 2B-3B texture, that stays parched-dry and frizzy. Moisturizing hair products that don’t leave any sticky or slimy residue are far and few in between. Carol’s Daughter got it right with this leave-in cream. It’s kept my hair moisturized and manageable since first applying it on freshly washed hair, 3 days ago. Yes, 3 days ago. I have not needed to reapply it since that first application and needless to say, I’m impressed! My curls still look great, healthy, moisturized. I have not been able to wear my hair down with just using a single product in Lord knows how long. At $22, it’s a little pricey upfront, but for the amount of product you get, and only using as much as your hair needs, this product should last a long time. 10/10 recommended"
13,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repair and Moisture for Curly Hair Monoi Star Strength Leave In Cream with Monoi Oil for Hydration and Softness, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have highly processed bleached hair that is extremely brittle and damaged.  Leave in conditioners are in must for me and I never go without them. I have had experience with many different brands and types and I can say that I am very happy with this one.This one is very creamy and spreads easily through out my hair strands. I don't have to use very much at all to get this to apply throughout my hair. A little dime sized dot is enough for me and I even have thick long hair.  This bottle will last for quite some time before needing to reorder. Good Bang for your buck.I really enjoy how this conditioner smells. It is definitely an in your face and obvious scent and leaves my hair smelling amazing for hours.  I really enjoy it but if you have issues with highly scented products this one might be a little overpowering for you. Something to note ahead of time. I am happy with the level of moisture this adds to my hair. I feel it really does help restore some of the much needed moisture to my hair and it makes it feel softer and smoother. I can get the brush through it much easier without it getting stuck when I apply it to my wet hair. The other thing I like about this leave in conditioner is that it doesn't make my hair look or feel oily at all, compared to some of the other leave in conditioners out there.  It doesn't weigh my hair down at all either."
14,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repair and Moisture for Curly Hair Monoi Star Strength Leave In Cream with Monoi Oil for Hydration and Softness, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tend to have thin, bleached, and frizzy hair, so I'm always looking for new moisturizing products to use. I also have half curled hair, so I either need to straighten it or scrunch it to make it curly. Initially, I thought this was the deep conditioner for the shower so that's what I used it for the first time. I should have been wearing my glasses, and realized a few days later this was the leave-in conditioner. I was super pleased on using it as a washout! Lol. When I finally used it the right way, it felt really good on my hair. A little goes a long way, and I learned that the first time since I'm used to using a little bit more leave in conditioner products. This brings impressive moisture. Another thing I do with products like this is put a little bit in a spray bottle along with a mixture of other products such as products for frizz or deep conditioning. The majority of it will be distilled water, and I use it after I wash my hair but also as a refresher on most areas except my roots. I am really impressed by this, as leave in conditioners are hard to find that don't leave my hair feeling icky or too dry. I definitely recommend."

It's great to prevent breakage and keep your hair healthy and strong. The scent is so good I wish it were a perfume I could buy. The leave-in is thick and creamy. It leaves your hair soft, moisturized and tangle-free. This definitely needs to be in your hair kit if you want stronger, healthier hair. I HIGHLY recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."

It smells a little weird to me until it goes in my hair, then it starts to smell pleasant. It's the right consistency to be used as a leave in. A lot of leave ins that I have tried have been too thin, but this one is thick enough that I don't have to worry about dripping it onto the floor.As softening and nice as this is...my hair is absolutely psycho. It still prefers the oil that I make. It's made well though, so I'm not going to ding it just because my weird hair hates it. My hair just doesn't work like normal hair."

I love the smell and and the thickness of the product. My hair feels so soft when I use this Monoi repair and moisture and so easy to comb through.

19,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repair and Moisture for Curly Hair Monoi Star Strength Leave In Cream with Monoi Oil for Hydration and Softness, 8.5 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"The main goal of any hair styling product for me is to reduce frizz while defining curls.  Ideally it's soft, not crunchy, and washes out easily.  This one's almost there.It's a thickish cream in the tube.  I used a small amount rubbed into my hands, then in my hair, evenly distributing from the crown of my hair to the tips.  There's a small amount of frizz remaining (disclaimer: it is a rainy day) and a bit more pouf than I'd like to the body of my hair, but my curls are light and tighter than usual.The scent is a faint coconut, not overpowering.  I needed to wash my hands twice to remove the residue of the styling product, which is a slight annoyance."

My hair smelled so great after using it. It also made my hair very smooth. I have curly hair that I usually blow dry straight so I need a leave-in conditioner to first detangle my curls after my shower, and this did the job. It didn't weigh my hair down which some leave-in conditioners can do. It wasn't greasy or too light. I'm very pleased with this product and like I said: smells like heaven!"
21,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repair and Moisture for Curly Hair Monoi Star Strength Leave In Cream with Monoi Oil for Hydration and Softness, 8.5 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SO I usually use a number of items to detangle my hair after I wash it because it's become dry and unruly lately. This was a GodSend. It can be applied right along with a spray detangler prior to blow dry. A little goes a long way. When I finish blow drying, my hair feels super smooth and soft. It doesn't have a build up or residue left and it is still bouncy and voluminous. It doesn't weigh my hair down or feel weird like product is in my hair. It'll definitely transform your hair if it's dry. I can't wait to get some more of this because it's a part of my blow dry routine now."

This one is thick but not too thick, makes my hair feel very soft and light, not weighed-down, and it smells heavenly - lightly floral with lots of coconut, and I'm from Hawai'i, so to me it smells like home.  I've used several other items from this brand and never been disappointed, so I have no problem recommending it to others."
23,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repair and Moisture for Curly Hair Monoi Star Strength Leave In Cream with Monoi Oil for Hydration and Softness, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this is a great product for curl definition, as there seems to be a bit of texturizer in it that I can feel harden once it dries.  So I would recommend it for those with wavy or curly hair that needs to be defined. I does leave my hair soft but I do wish there was a bit more hydration, my parched curls need a ton of hydration and this wasn’t quite there for me personally. The smell is very nice, like coconut and vanilla, and the tube has a tonnn of product in it so it will last a really long time."

A mix of coconut and flowers. It is a thinner consistency so it works well for even finer hair types like myself. I have used the monoi shampoo and conditioner for year and it has never disappointed.

Unfortunately, this one doesn’t seem to add moisture; instead it makes my hair feel too soft.  And that makes it more difficult to style.  The end result is soft hair (almost fly-away), little body and hardly any control.  I’ll stick with leave-in conditioners that give me better texture."

32,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Repair and Moisture for Curly Hair Monoi Star Strength Leave In Cream with Monoi Oil for Hydration and Softness, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have naturally wavy/curly (2C/3A) hair that I typically heat-style. However, I've been trying to give it a break from heat during the lockdown to help with damage; this means learning to work with my curls rather than fighting them. Since my hair is fine, many curl creams weigh it down and make it look greasy and lifeless. This is a nice compromise between those creams that are too heavy and goopy, and those that are too light and lack moisture/frizz control. The formula is really creamy and leaves my hair very soft and hydrated (very soft--it won't hold a braid with this stuff in it). My curls don't shrink as badly as they do when I just use a leave-in, and I like the scent; it also helps with frizz (at least this time of year--summer would be the real test). My only issue with it is that it doesn't seem to work very well on day 2 after washing; when I woke up, my hair was tangled and difficult to detangle (not unusual for my fine, tangle-prone hair, but some products do last into day 2). I used some detangling spray and it was fine, but typically I'm able to get a couple of days of smooth hair when using a product like this, but this one seemed to all absorb by the end of day 1. I did try adding a bit more to my ends only, and that helped, but then they stuck together a bit. I believe this is a good moisturizer and it works well on my waves, but the curlier parts of my hair needed more moisture the second day. On a positive note, my roots weren't greasy or goopy and my hair wasn't flat or greasy looking; I could easily run my fingers through it after air-drying, which is not all that common for me. I've only used one other product (a Bumble and Bumble product) that works this well after air-drying, but I would consider it slightly better because the results last until my next wash (day 3), so I would give it 5 stars and this 4 stars. This one is a lot less expensive, though, and you get a large amount, so that is a definite factor in this product's favor. It may work better if I added a styling product, but it's pretty nice on its own for at least the first day. As far as strength goes, I haven't noticed less breakage when using this (nor more...just the same).I would recommend this for moisture and some control of dry, wavy/somewhat curly hair, but if you have really curly hair, you may need something thicker/more potent, or an added styling aid."

It smells like white flowers. You can smell the tiare and gardenia quite strongly. It smells like kind of a heavy white flower fragrance to me. Reminds me of BB&W velvet tuberose fragrance. The smell dissipates a bit after drying but it stays pretty strong. I have not used it to heat style yet as I do that very rarely. It is not CG friendly so in combination with the fact that I don’t like the smell, I will drop it from my rotation. It has 3 different dimethicones and a drying alcohol in it. It left my curls a little weighed down but it looked pretty shiny. As a leave in, it dried a little hard but it was able to be scrunched without any flaking or anything.Please hit the button if this info was helpful."

I have long, fine hair and it's so lifeless that styling is about the only thing I can do to bring the va-va-voom to it. Unfortunately, as a brunette, any time I have damage it shows up on the ends of my hair quite noticeably because of my hair color and the splits.This seems to be working well. I suspect it's the coconut oil in it. It's listed high up on the ingredient list, and it feels soft and silky in my hair. I mist my hair every time I get ready to use a styling tool, but I have also been using this as a general leave in conditioner since the coconut oil makes my hair feel so much nicer when I brush it through my hair. It seems like it gives me a little shine, too.The scent of this reminded me a salon, particularly the purple shimmering lights shampoo. It is a pleasant scent, and doesn't smell heavy like vanilla and lavenders often do. The ingredient list is what I'd call typical. It does have alcohol, but moderation is really key with any hair product.I have noticed less end breakage, and my hair just looks better when using this for styling. It seems like it gives it a little more gloss so it isn't as dry looking. It's also been working nicely for daily use as a moisture provider. I just mist the last couple inches of my hair and brush through. Easy peasy. I'd get this again. The price is comparable to other salon leave-ins.The spritzer on this is excellent. When I opened the bottom, I was worried it was too thick, but it mists wonderfully. The locking mechanism is super simple to use. It has a button to push side to side that visibly says if it's locked or unlocked. It's friendly to use. It's also worth noting this does have petroleum in it, mineral oil, parabens, or any artificial color that may deposit. Coconut oil is ingredient number two, after water so the majority of the product is nourishing oils.Cons: It isn't an issue for me, however consumers should know it has linalool in it and that's likely where most of the scent comes from. Just worth noting if that's an issue for you or you have sensitivity to some smells."
11,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Multi Styling Milk, Lightweight Protective Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil for Dry, Damaged and Breakage Prone Hair To Repair and Protect as You Style, 6.8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,See update at endI haven’t use Carol‘s daughters products in a long time. I was surprised at this leave in conditioner with a spray bottle. It releases a very fine spray of the product. It’s actually works good for my hair. I have very fine 3C curly hair. A lot of times my leave in conditioner weighs down my hair before I can even put the styling product on. The picture is from a wash day and it immediately has more body to it while drying then when I use my regular leave in conditioner. I’m sure my hair will keep growing in body the dryer it gets. The fine mist  also will be better when I use it to touch up the dry ends in the days following the wash day.UPDATE: My hair did not keep getting fluffier day after my wash day. Even just the little bit of spray that I used seemed to weigh down my baby fine hair. The next day it starts clumping together which it only does when there’s too much oil product in it. This is the only change in my routine that I’ve made. I didn’t think that I used a lot of the spray. Only two or three squirts on my hair before my mousse product. I don’t think that this is a good fit for my hair. I think I’ll stick with their other products.

Firstly, it came with the cap trigger on backwards. I had to disassemble abs figure out how to get in on correctly. I assumed this was to stop it from spray leaking in transport, but the spray had a lock so this didn’t make sense. I eventually got the sprayer on correctly, and it BROKE the first time I used it. I was able to figure out how to pump some out and the first thing I noticed was the AWFUL SCENT. It smelled like old lady perfume and gave me an awful headache. Thankfully the smell dissipated, but the spray did nothing for my hair. My hair felt frizzy and unconditioned all day. Very disappointed.."

I’ve heard wonderful things about Carol’s Daughter for curly hair, so I was stoked to try this. But I couldn’t find much I loved about it, unfortunately.As a leave-in conditioner and reparative treatment for curly haired days, it was just OK. First, I tried it by itself, to see what, if anything, it would do to help define curls while it provided whatever conditioning power it was going to. Didn’t do much except weigh my hair down.Next, I tried it as a heat protectant when I straightened my hair. Even less impressed. I actually ended up adding an additional protectant product halfway through running my straightening iron over my hair because I felt like it wasn’t doing enough to protect it. And my ends still looked dry afterward.Maybe I’m just missing something, but this product didn’t live up to the brand’s hype. At least not for me. Very disappointed."

So when I saw this product available on Amazon, I jumped to try it. So glad I did. This leave in conditioner is amazing.It’s a thin consistency spray on conditioner that makes it easy to get good coverage over the length of my hair. The fragrance is my favorite part. I literally can smell it all day, even when I have a scarf over my hair.Using this as a leave-in conditioner, my hair afterwards feels silky, soft and hydrated. Using it as a pre-heat treatment, it leaves my hair smooth and frizz-free. You know how some products leave behind a film on your hair that you can feel every time you touch your hair? Yeah, that doesn’t happen here. My hair feels like my hair, just much MUCH healthier. Super satisfied with how well this leave in conditioner has been working for me. I’m going to have to make room in our budget for it. A+++++++ product!"

This monoi milk formula is wonderful—it’s lightweight but leaves hair hydrated and natural looking.  I keep my hair short and textured—lots of layers that accentuate wavy hair.  This spray form is easy to use and smells great.  End results are soft, manageable hair that feels like it did when I was a younger woman.  For added shine and smoothness, I often include Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend after drying my hair.  It’s a great combination that may not work well for oily heads of hair, but totally rejuvenates my dry strands.  This formula has a strong scent of tiare flowers, Tahitian gardenias and coprah coconut oil, and it lingers after styling.  I especially like the spray cap's unique built-in lock system--makes this bottle perfect for travel."

I used it when my hair was natural and found that it made a big difference in combing it out. It has some slip to it but a good amount of emollient ingredients as well so it's nourishing. I also used it in combing ou my relaxed hair and found that it helps with detangling. There are times that I would apply it before blow drying with a hand dryer and found that it doesn't cause a buildup or residue, which is a plus when you're trying to achieve bounce in your hair. I will say that it's one of those things where a little goes a long way so you don't really need a lot to accomplish the goal. I think it's really versatile in terms of when you can use it so I would say it's really nice to have on hand. It's in a spray bottle but comes out fairly well for a thick creamy substance. The scent is nice but not powerful or overbearing. It's worth the money."

I sprayed some on my hand and rubbed it all over my wet hair after showering. In my opinion the scent was similar to spray-net but it didn't remain and wasn't overpowering. I like the bottle and the spray dispenser. As I was rushing to work that was all I could use it for. I'm very excited to try it again in the weekend and use it as a heat protectant and see how my hair will fare. I'll definitely update my review once I try this multi-styling milk. But so far, yeah as a leave in treatment I'm pretty happy with it. BTW my hair is thick, chemically colored black and kinda damaged (from years of japanese straightening but I've stopped that more than 2 years now)"

Unfortunately, after several uses, it just left me a little blah about it.While the scent was nice and subtle it only seemed to offer minimal extra conditioning for my hair. In addition, I have thin hair and this was just too heavy for it and weighed down my curls which is not what I'm looking for. The final straw was the sprayer broke which leaves no good option to use the rest of the product!I've gone back to what I usually use and my hair is much happier now. Maybe this would work better for someone with thicker hair."

The light coconut scent is very pleasant, and as it goes on in a fairly fine mist it doesn’t weigh my hair down. I haven’t been using it long enough to know if it has a noticeable strengthening effect, and unfortunately I’m not sure I’ll keep using it regularly enough to learn. Despite the good points this leaves my hair (which is fairly short, as I’m a guy) feeling just a little greasy, and that’s a dealbreaker for me. Even slightly greasy hair hits me like nails down a blackboard, so I can’t see myself using this very much.I’m giving it 4 stars, though, because apart from the residue it looks and smells like a really good product."

A heat protectant and a leave in conditioner all in one - 2fer 1 😆 I'm a fan of Carol's Daughter products. They work wonders in my kids hair (I'm white, their dad is AA, and their hair is all over the place). This one I have been using as a leave in for my daughter. The thing with every Carol's Daughter product I've ever tried is they leave my kids curls looking boing-a-liscious while also making them look soft and healthy (instead of wet and hard as some products do). It's a spray, so I get lots of coverage and get to use less product to do so. This is a wonderful product for curly haired people and people with a little bit of everything going on up top. Carol's Daughter for the win again!"

She can use only this and it holds her coils and makes them look hydrated and healthy. It also does the same if she’s wearing her hair in a pouf, looks really nice. My wife, who is white-- I mention that just because her hair texture is different than our daughter’s and not all products that work for our daughter work out for her hair-- she loves to put it in her ends after styling since her ends are usually really dry and says it's very moisturizing. They both are liking it a lot and say that it smells amazing. The bottle is a good size, nozzle works good and has a lock for the sprayer that also works good."

It lingers for a little while after you use it. I used it for a protective style and my hair smelled wonderful. It mists a little too wide for me but I just ended up spraying it closer to the section of hair I was working with. It definitely helped with detangling and I think made my curls a little tighter. It made my hair a little softer and easier to manage which is always a good thing. Adding to my wash day regimen.

They just end up weighing down my hair too much. But I do like to use them on the areas away from my scalp, especially the ends. This protecting spray smells very nice. It reminds me of the beach. It must be the coconut oil scent. Anyway, I really like it. It adds a nice softness to my hair, making it much more manageable without making it limp. I like that it offers protection against all the heated styling tools I use as well. It is a nice size bottle at almost 7 ounces with a easy to use trigger spray nozzle.
