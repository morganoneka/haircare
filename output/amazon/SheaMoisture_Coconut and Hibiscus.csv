0,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,CHANGED INGREDIENTS! NO LONGER SULFATE FREE!!! DO NOT BUY,"Shea Moisture is still advertising that this product is sulfate free. You can see they changed the formula and have removed the NO SULFATES as well as removing No Parafin,  No Propylene Glycol (they now have alcohol in this product!!), No Synthetic Fragrance, No Synthetic Color, and No DEA . Super disappointed as I really loved the way this made my hair feel and now with the addition of more alcohols, more vegetable oil, sulfates and other less than ideal ingredients that I do not want to put in my hair. Companies are just getting greedy and trying to cut corners to save money but charge us the same for products that will do more damage than good. NO THANKS."
1,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great For Making Hair More Curly,"I'm so glad that I started using this product line. From my experience, this is the best hair product for making my hair more curly and less dry. I've tried a lot of hair products over the years, as my hair is dry, coarse, and unruly. I have a few calics in my hair, and it's always been challenging to style. Since the recent pandemic, I haven't been to a hair salon in some time and my wife has been giving me home haircuts. I've let my hair grow in the top and tried a number of hair products to make my hair curly. This product line is the best for my hair and I've purchased a number of their products recently. I find their products give my hair moisture and make it more curly. Love their products and highly recommend them."
2,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Never again,I can’t even speak about how this actually works because I can’t get beyond the smell. It’s terrible. Even using the teeniest bit of the product I got a headache from the icky sweet smell that wouldn’t go away. It’s way too strong and will overpower everything else around you. I literally couldn’t smell my food because of this stuff in my hair and everywhere I went people asked what was that “weird candy smell”?  The headache I had from using it lasted for days after washing it out. I’ll never wear this again. Do not buy!
3,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Low Porosity Curl Smoothie,"Love this for my low porosity 4a/4b Hair. My hair is so soft, curly, and moisturized after using this curl smoothie. I also do the LCO method on my hair and it performs well. Even 2-3 days after a twist out, my hair is so soft!"
4,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but never getting it from them again!!","I have been using this line of products for a few months now, and can attest to how great the actual product works. I also use the shampoo and conditioner that accompany this leave in conditioner and my hair is so soft and the frizz is down. I have a good hair day almost every day!!That being said, the product was opened before I even got it. It had spilled all through the bag it was in.I have pictures I will add if I can figure that out."
5,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a miracle product for curly hair,"I love this product! My hair is very long, thick, hard to manage and goes from being wavy and frizzy to very curly and defined depending on the day/weather and it’s mood. I’ve tried so many products at so many price points it’s exhausting and expensive. I don’t usually use anything on dry/damp hair or on hair that’s not freshly washed because it’s never worked for me, my hair usually just goes limp or gets crunchy or greasy. I kept seeing this product on curly blogs so I finally bought it. It took awhile to arrive so I had kind of forgotten about it by the time it did. First off, the container is HuGe! It will probably last me the rest of my life. For real. I’ve used it on my hair soaking wet before I get out of the shower (the curly method) and I’ve been courageous and used it on second and third day hair that’s gotten flat/frizzy. ITS AMAZING! On second and third day hair I dampen my hair a bit, apply a nickel sized amount to my palms and do the “praying hands” and my curls are bouncier and more defined and shiny than they have been in years! No crunch, no greasiness! It’s incredible! I didn’t know my curls could look so good. I’ve even done it in dry hair. It’s not as beautiful but it’s still quite good. The smell is wonderful as well."
6,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"ALRIGHT, HERE'S THE INGREDIENTS Y'ALL!","This item is the same exact item as they used to sell in the small tubes (kudos to you shea moisture for going more eco friendly!) I am glad I can just buy one big jar instead of a bunch of small tubes that are hard to recycle.I had asked a question on this listing, about the ingredients. Someone answered saying that it broke their hair off- I can say as someone who has used SHEA MOISTURE products for almost a decade AND AS A PROFESSIONAL STYLIST licensed in the state of ks that no, there is nothing in this product that would've damaged your hair. In fact, the reason why I love this product line is that I find it to be much better than a lot of products you buy at a salon!!!! Their products contain nourishing ingredients that ACTUALLY WORK. A lot of the pro stuff is overpriced, overscented, and just isn't really that great tbh. I love this one for my wavy hair, I put it in after showering and towel drying then I scrunch it and it has enough hold to bring out the curl but it isn't crunchy at all and leaves the hair feeling soft. I am also sensitive to fragrances, and this one isn't bad at all. Sorry to the person who had the damaged hair, but that happened because your hair was already damaged.Also, a note to the manufacturer, who also answered my question about the ingredients - saying that they were listed in the images. They are not, and in fact, your listing pictures state this product contains mushrooms when it doesn't. So you might want to fix that :)"
7,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged mess!,A picture says it all. I'm expected to return this? The box arrived soggy and when I opened it I found out why. The conditioner was completely smashed open and a mess.I'm hoping I will get a refund but it seems I'm expected to send the product back.
8,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Product was opened!,"There’s no place to upload a photo...but product was OPEN in package and Mesa was everywhere. Very disappointed, hoping for a replacement ASAP. Can’t rate on usage, only on product shipping. Reasoning for 1 star, hopefully I can use product in future and give a higher rating!"
9,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizer & curl definition product,"Great moisturizer! It defines my curls. It even tames my hair. My hair isn't frizzy at the end of the day and it's easier to manage when using this product. I use this product only when I wear ponytails; it gives it a really nice shiny slick look. I don't use it when I wear it free of ponytails because it's a bit heavy. I use other products for my natural curly bob. However, my daughter uses it for everything...her hair is thicker and she's a 3b and I'm a 3a not sure if that matters. I really dislike the smell but it doesn't bother my daughter. Hope this helps someone."
10,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Creates soft curls!,"I scrunch this smoothie through my hair and it creates soft, wavy curls. It adds so much texture without making hair hard and crunchy at a great price!"
11,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Unsealed.,"I have used this product before and my rating would be a five however, this arrived unsealed which leaves me a tad uneasy. I know there's a chance it just got jossled in shipping, but it still runs me the wrong way you know?"
12,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A curly hair must,"This is a great product, my favorite for doing twists. It's extremely moisturizing to my 4c hair. Definitely buy if you have curly hair."
13,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair LOVES this smoothie!,"This is my hairs favorite product & I was so happy to get such a big bottle. I have never seen this size in the store so I was super excited to find this on Amazon. Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie is a holy grail product of mine. I'm a Hairbox subscriber so I get lots of products every month but I MUST ALWAYS have this smoothie on hand no matter what. I love the scent, the thickness & the way it makes my natural curls pop."
14,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I have 4c hair and this softened my hair
15,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Perfect,THIS STUFF IS SO AMAZING. Omg like it just makes my hair look so damn good! I let my hair towel/air dry and then comb this stuff through and finish with OGX coconut curl mousse & it’s like magic. Before buying the bigger size I tried a smaller bottle of this stuff and for some reason the smaller bottle smells really weird; this one smells waaay better. I 100% recommend this if you have curly/wavy hair and want your hair to look smooth and frizz free!
16,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A miracle for my Caucasian curls without the grease,"So I've been experimenting with products over the years to tame my frizzy curly locks & have hated my hair more years of my life than I care to admit. But after moving to South Florida and having to give up the hair straightening iron due to 100% humidity down here I started a journey to research the best products for Caucasian curly hair. Because let's just be real here our curly hair is composed up differently and needs imo less greasy products. Every curly hair product I've found either was to brittle and drying or too greasy. I stumbled upon a some YouTube videos about this curly head method or something like that and one of them recommended this product. So what I do is I just condition my hair I use regular conditioner as shampoo and a deep condition once or twice a week to really condition. With head flipped upside-down soaking wet in the shower I apply a leave in, TGIN thank God it's natural makes a good one, then I apply this & scrunch a little to get rid of excess water. With head still upside-down I take a tshirt and scrunch the excess water out after I get out. Then apply a hard cheap gel with lots of hold scrunch more and wrap my head with the tshirt(search YouTube of how to use tshirt to wrap curly hair to dry). I let that sit on my head for however long anywhere between 30 minutes and a couple of hours not usually a couple hours I would say 30 minutes to an hour and then I let it all out and let it air dry or defuse the rest of the way when it’s mostly dry with a bout 80 to 85% dry I scrunch it with the T-shirt while it’s upside down and I put my fingers through like my scalp and I just kind of shake the hair and scrunch it kind of break it up if it’s hard at all  and then Wala it’s done. to me this is a miracle product I am in love with it I would never try anything else because I’m 100% happy with it for myself and my  curls. it smells so good my husband loves the way it smells sweet and fruity. I would say that I use a decent amount like I would say a tablespoon or so I usually scoop out a little on my 3 fingers for my medium length hair. It will feel slippery kind of but when is all said and done the look will look like the picture I uploaded. Obviously all of our hair is so different that’s why I did I mention in my title that it was for my Caucasian hair and I mean Caucasian hair is not on the same either but this stuff works for me, I would consider my hair normal as in not too greasy or dry. The curls as average not super tight kinky curls not really loose. if I were to just air dry my hair without anything it would poof out a little bit I would have some curl to it and it would look a hot mess with extra frizz lol. Hope this helps and if you still need more help with your curls I recommend searching YouTube. Good luck!"
17,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells DELICIOUS, But the Hype is Too High","It smells GREAT, but that is about all that I can say about it. I bought this to help add moisture to my hair but it just made it greasy. I tried using it more than once because the fragrance is so sensational that I cannot bear to just throw it away. The first time, I used it right after my leave-in as a heavier moisturizer and layered it with my hair butter. My hair was greasy but dry the next day. The next time I tried, I used it instead of my hair butter, but my hair ended up just dry and not greasy this time. Finally I tried it without a leave-in and without hair butter. Still a no-go; it didn’t want to absorb right and was difficult to work in under all circumstances I have tried. What a shame; I just can’t get over the smell. I might just try mixing it with aloe vera to help with the moisture, but I can’t say it will change anything. I have to pass on repurchasing."
18,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very economical.,I have used for 8 years now buying the 12 oz size.So this 20 oz container of the curl enhancing smoothie is very economical for $15.99 some places are charging that for 12 oz jar.I plan to buy 2 more jars.
19,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!,"I can’t live without this! After washing & conditioning and lightly towel drying, I comb through my 2B waves with a very wide-tooth pick, them put a dollop of the Shea Moisture in my hands with a little water, rub between my hands then work through my hair repeating several times to cover all hair. My hair is pretty wet at this point. I then scrunch my hair gently with a microfiber towel and either air dry or use diffuser set on low. My waves turn out soft, shiny and with no frizz! On days I don’t want to wash my hair, I do the same routine but on dry hair that I have run through with the hair pick. I just use a little less product. Same result! Awesome. (Smells great too!)"
20,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great but product itself is not that great,"First time trying this product and I was not too happy with the curl cream:( I have been looking for a drug store product to replace the dove mouse that I used to use but not seems like it’s discontinued or the formula has changed .the smell of the product is absolutely amazing but that might be the only thing I love  about it , the product itself leaves your hair weighed down and lacking shine . I have very curly hair that needs something light weigh to keep the curl shape and maybe reduce frizz but this dosent do either :( I was pretty excited to try this after reading good reviews but sadly it’s a no from me . >>>picture with the blue sweater shows my hair with my old product and the first picture  shows hair with the sheamoisture cream <<<"
21,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Who Knew?!!,"Alright, I’m one of the women who found this suggested on TikTok for white women’s curly/wavy hair.It works better than any of the other “curly” methods! It DOES take practice, but it leaves my hair curly and smelling better than those other products pushed on us!"
22,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for natural hair,My hair is naturally curly and I like this product for the moisturizer that it provides my hair not to heavy and it holds my curls in place. I have used many products but I have found this to be the best. As well as the kids products I use those as well.
23,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not my cup of tea.,I have curly short blonde hair that's a little damaged only at my tips even though I did cut it because I only died the tips blonde. But I bought this to bounce my curls after buying the shea moisture shine shampoo & conditioner..At first it worked than it started to tangle my hair & it become into knots that was hard to untangle no matter how much conditioner I applied to my hair. I cried while untangling my hair because my arm was killing me my boyfriend had to take over & even he had a rough time it made my hair become weird even more damaged. Than this smoothie makes my hair beyond itchy & it becomes hard & oily. It makes you hair smell funny. I had to wash my hair during midnight I couldn't sleep well because my scalp was so itchy from the shea moisture smoothie I couldn't stop itching. I'll stick to my Tressemme & Suave. They're cheap but they both work some wonders for their price.
24,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,"Love this product! The smell is a heavenly coconut, and it does wonders for moisturizing dry hair. The product is thick enough that it doesn't feel like it all dries up after an hour, so it ensures all day moisture and shine. Of course it still has that slight greasy texture to it and will definitely leave a residue on fabrics. It's a little on the heavier side, but if used sparingly it shouldn't weigh your hair down much."
25,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horribly package. Jars unsealed/could be anything in these jars,Horribly packaged. Open jar and your looking right at product!!! The container had no sealant when I opened the jar. Product all over outside of container.I don't feel comfortable using this at all as I have no clue what's in these unsealed jars.I will be returning asap.Such an inconvenience
26,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT SULFATE FREE,This product is NOT sulfate free!! They advertise this as silicone and sulfate free but no where on this does it actually say sulfate free. I originally got this bc it was sulfate free but now I will not be using it. I don’t know if they changed their ingredients but there has been a lot of people also saying they took it out.. would not recommend
27,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Formula changed,"I haven't used this in a LONG time but I remember it worked well for my wash-and-go's. I did think it was strange that it was only $7 but thought maybe they lowered prices to compete since there are so many other brands out there now. But NOPE! That's not why.As soon as I opened it, I noticed it looked different, then it felt different on my fingers. I decided to use it anyway. My hair has now dried and I'm about to wash this out. Not even close to the same results.Did a search and found out they changed the formula back in 2020.Am done with you Shea moisture. Second time you switched out a product I really loved, and the last one damaged my hair before I realized why it was acting up. You also discontinued a third product I loved.Selling the company was the worst move ever. They don't care about black hair.I left 2 stars cause I felt its feeble attempt at moisture. But seriously, I'm done with y'all."
28,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,An okay product.,This product was a little pricey for what it does. I bought it because of an add that I saw for it. I feel like it works as week as some other products that are cheaper. The scent is good but not what I consider fantastic.
29,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Son teams this up with the same brand shampoo & the 2 work great together. The smell of coconut & hibiscus. It also has silk protein & neem oil which have great benefits for curly hair. He applies this on damp hair & lets it sit for a few minutes. This locks his curls & moisturizes his hair. Sometimes he dries it a little or lets it air dry. Either way he has found the product he turns to after a good cleansing. It has no parabens which is means this is a positive product for your hair. The story behind the creation of Shea’s Moisture is very touchy which goes back to 1912. This is a win win using both the shampoo & the smoothie. A quality product at a good price. A 12 ounce jar carries a lot of product & lasts quite awhile. It’s well worth what I play. My picture reflects what the product looks like as well as the story behind the creation of this product which I wanted to share. I definitely recommend!
30,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,EASY APPLICATION,"4/5 because the texture seemed different, I usually buy this on a daily but there was no seal and the consistency was more thick than usual. I would spray the hair with water and add this immediately. Overall it did its job and made my curls fluffy and shiny."
31,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Shea products,I usually pick this up at brick and mortar stores but decided to grab a bigger version because it's way cheaper . Love the scent and the fact it keeps my curls manageable and not weighed down . If I over use it my curls do become hard like a mousse but it doesn't flake and become nasty . Good product
32,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Frizz go away!,Omg! This product is AMAZING. I have the type of hair that is not curly or straight. It is just A frizzy wavy mess. This product is very moisturizing and it keeps my hair so soft. I’m so glad I took the chance with this!
33,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,For the hair that demands,"I have used this product for a little less than a year, however in that time I find it to be top notch. It is a heavy cream, so one must gauge how much to apply for your self and needs The fragrance is that of a natural oil(Shea butter)with coconut mixed in.There have been others who state that L’Oréal changed the formula and marketing toward the straight and Caucasian hair after they purchased the company. There was much uproar over this. Once again, it is a choice.My only complaint is with the packaging. There was one deflated bubble pack in a too large box. The lid was jarred loose and some product leaked out. Fortunately the lid did not come completely off. I find more often than not the Amazon packaging leaves much to be desired."
34,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Most awful smell,"I really wonder if I got a bad batch because this is my first time using and it’s awful.  I never have issues with the way products smell. I don’t have a sensitive nose or mind strong scents. The scent of this is horrific like another person mentioned. I wish I had read what she said before I bought it.I put a little in my hair and I can’t even get the smell out of my hands. It’s everywhere. It’s like a really stale expired candy.Unless you’re going to shampoo your hair right after use, I wouldn’t recommend."
35,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,This product is reasonably priced on Amazon. It works wonders on your natural hair. I will continue recommending for such products to be packaged with a sealant. I want to feel that no one else has been dipping into my product or adding anything to it and then returning it. I don’t get that feeling when I receive a product without sealant. This may be a matter to be take up with the manufacturer of the product. Thanks
36,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Used to be great but now my hair hates it,"I used to love this product and it used to work wonders in my hair when I was in high school. Now my hair hates it and get dry after a day. The scent is great and the price is good for the amount you are getting, but I dont think I can use it anymore. I am still a lover of sheamoisture and will stick to their deep conditioners."
37,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,leaves hair feeling silky,"the only product that gives my hair a silky feel.  My 4c hair just wouldn't absorb moisture at all. it generally feels  coarse no matter the product.  just tried it today and my hair feels moisturized and great. however, if you expect this to curl your 4c hair, that ain't happening. I will use this as a moisturizer.Update...I finally got the Curls in....but it only works when my hair is damp not wet."
38,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for finer curls too,"My hair is a mixture of 3B and some 2B chunks and this makes my hair look AMAZING. Put it into wet, not damp hair. Don't be afraid to use a lot of product. It's fine to air dry or use a diffuser with. Usually, I let my hair air dry for a bit and then when it's closer to damp than sopping I pile it into a bonnet. Then when it's fully dry my curls are p e r f e c t. Literally never look better"
39,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed feelings,"I have wavy hair, dry hair that gets frizzy and I wanted something to tame it and give it a bit of hold. The cream was quite smooth out of the container, and I applied a small amount of it to my towel-dried hair all over and scrunched it to enhance the waves. The smell was overwhelmingly sweet and actually made me feel a bit sick but it may be ok for those who like a super sweet fruity scents. My hair actually dried nice and my waves became soft curls and less frizzy. That lasted around 2 days, around day 3, my hair got sticky, greasy, tangled and matted. I can usually go 3-4 days without washing as I have very dry hair, but with this cream applied, it goes from nice to greasy and horrible very quickly."
40,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair is so fly….,"I don’t know why it took me so long to suck it up and spend the 30 or so dollars to buy this whole line… OMG. I washed my hair after my subscribe and save arrived with the shampoo, conditioner and then used this on my curls in my hair looks nothing short of amazing. It doesn’t make your hair feel like there’s a bunch of product in it and it’s super easy to rub between your hands and either fall along the curls or very lightly scrunch it…No more blowouts for me I am rocking my natural curls and loving it!Also the coconut sent is not overwhelming at all"
41,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Light-weight, smooth",This product is really nice and makes your hair feel healthy and smooth. The formula helps create a nice natural wave to your hair.
42,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for 4c hair twist outs!,The negative reviews are coming from people with straight or non-curly type textures who don’t require oil or moisture. Not sure why they would think this work for them… oh well! It works great for 4c hair types and completely nourishes your hair. The 20oz size is a bonus!
43,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,leaves a horrible film makes hair feel chalky,I followed the instructions and put in wet hair.  I normally do fat curls to make beachy waves and my hair felt horrible.  I had to wash again after it dried I styled first then added a little coating and I like it.  My hair does feel very soft.  I wouldn't advise putting it in if you do any kind of styling.  after styling is fine.  Smells awesome.
44,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,An OG Staple Hair Product,"This is my favorite curl cream, it smells so good and is very moisturizing. I have very thick high density hair, with curls and coils, a mix of curl patterns. I also do layer a gel after applying this product, my hair doesn't get crunchy though, it remains soft and I truly believe it's because of the moisture of this cream. It's nice and thick as well. The value of this particular one is excellent too, natural hair care can get expensive and this has always been an affordable product but to get this amount for the price is just *chefs kiss** I'm not heavy handed with product application, but I'm definitely not shy either, I use enough product for my hair to be thoroughly covered so the value is everything. My hair is low porosity and I style it in wash n go's, but this cream certainly can be used for braid outs or twist outs also. I will repurchase."
45,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best for coarse curly hair,"Okay so I have wavy hair and this is most definitely way too heavy for my hair type, but it works! If you have coarse hair, particularly very curly coarse hair, this might be a godsend! I have to use a tiny amount and fluff my hair up with texture sprays when I use it, but it does moisturize my hair extremely well. I will say that sectioning your hair out first and then combing it through with your fingers seems to work best for me!"
46,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,NEW FAVORITE CURL CREAM,Have VERY curly Caucasian hair that had been dyed. This cream is so moisturizing and helps define my curls without leaving them crunchy. I have used many professional brands and this competes with those. Not only is it amazing quality but a little goes a long way so you’re not buying new jars every other week. Use it every day and it’s still over half full after a month. Oh and it smells amazing.
47,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silky hair,"I just took the plunge and tried this because of my good experience with other Shea (Black Caster oil) Moisture products. This one is quickly becoming my favorite. I like the lighter aroma and the silky feel, and the fact that just a small amount goes a long way. My hair is 3c,4a-or-4b or 4c ( mixed textures). I frequently twist out and wash & go, so this product works for both.My hair loves this!Get it. I am so glad I did!"
48,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not meant for thinner hair,"My hair has been thinning as of late, and this stuff is not meant for thin hair.I have 2b wavy hair but because it’s thinning, this product is too heavy for me and it actually weights my hair down. I’m better off just using a leave in conditioner and a gel."
49,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use TOO MUCH.,"Really, you'll be happier if you use 1/4 of what you think you will need. Then, comb it and comb it and comb it through. Spend more time massaging it throughout your hair and you think is reasonable. Then, let it dry and enjoy thicker curlier hair. To refresh, simply add a little water to your hair and restyle."
50,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product....not great packaging,"BEWARE...this product is shipped without being sealed so if the cover comes off in shipment, you'll have a real mess on your hands. I ordered the first one and when it came unsealed and had leaked, I ordered another one. The product itself lives up to the manufacture's description and those who have given a great review of the product. It will leave your curls soft and manageable. The packaging is the problem."
51,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Product arrived opened and with no safety seal,This product arrived opened and without any plastic or safety seal to ensure that this was an unused item. It did not look new. I will be returning this item and I hope that the seller reads this and does not give this item to someone else. The scent is okay. I don't like too much scent in my hair products and this scent was tolerable.
52,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jar not sealed,"This jar was not sealed; therefore, I'm slightly concerned that someone may have used some of it before it was delivered to me. The box was taped, but the lid on the jar was not tight, and it didn't have the seal under the lid. Maybe Shea Moisture doesn't seal them the way they used to."
53,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,What am I supposed to do with this?,"The bottle was open in transit and leaked all over the box. A complete mess! When I went to see about getting a replacement or refund, it wants me to return the messy bottle before I can get a replacement or be charged a second time!I am not cleaning this mess just to return the jar!! Absolutely unexceptable! There should be a solution to this problem by now, seeing as I am not the only one to have had this issue. I want my money back!"
54,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing for my hair,"At first, the scent was a little strong but after a couple of uses I adapted to it. I apply it to damp/soaking hair and do the hair plopping method for best results. Once it dries it not crunchy at all and it leave behind a mild hibiscus sent. I've been using this product for well over a 2 years and I have not found anything better. I can use this on its own or with a soft gel to had more hold but it works fine on its own."
55,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing but use caution,"I like this product, but you have to be very careful to use the smallest amount required or it really weighs down your hair and makes it feel kinda sticky. That said it smells absolutely amazing. I usually use it sparingly for touch ups ok my curly and use something else for all over control to avoid that heavy feeling it can cause"
56,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting,"I bought this item in hopes to get my curls back after straightening my hair for so long. I put it in my hair after my shower, my hair was damp. When I woke up the curls were pretty nice, but the texture of my hair felt really weird. Every time I touched my hair it left a residue on my fingers, which I hated. I didn't like the texture of my hair. It took me two showers for the residue to get out. On the other side, my curls looked really nice the following days. I also really love the smell of these products! If you won't mind the texture of you're hair then this could really help your curls. (This was the experience with my hair, it might not be with yours). Also if anyone has any recommendations for other curling products please tell me."
57,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I used this product on my 4b/c hair texture, and it worked well for me. I am new to natural hair and this curl enhancer made it much easier for me. I originally used the product with a denman brush, but the hair style came out poofy and fuzzy. After research I finger coiled my hair instead of using the brush and it came out perfectly. Overall, the product smells great and works well for me. { I also separately purchased and used their hold and shine spray and they worked great together!}"
58,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely amazing for thick, course, curly hair.","I can't believe I waited so long to try this product. I have spent so much money on products trying to tame and control my curls and have never been as happy as I am with this product. After conditioning my hair I use it to twist the curls and allow it to dry, then use my fingers to break up the twists and style. So easy and this works so well using the twist technique. The only wish the scent lasted a little longer because I really like it.I will definitely be purchasing this again!"
59,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value curly hair product,"My first impression was not terrific. I put this in my medium curly hair while wet and it left greasy residue.  I decided to try again though on my dry hair on a day I just wanted to style my hair without wetting it. This product worked great when smoothed through my hair dry, taming my frizz and defining my curls without making them greasy (a little goes a long way!). I took off one star for the scent because it has a sort of artificial smell to it, but it doesn't ruin the product for me. Altogether a great value and will be used by me much in the future especially on frizzy hair days."
60,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same product as before.,I've bought this same hair product from Walmart and it seems to be a bit different as far as the texture of this hair product now so I believe it's not the same . Won't be buying it anymore from Amazon or Walmart if the product seems different from before.
61,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"The product was old. It came all congealed, its supposed to be smooth and easily distributed in your hair. But since it was congealed it small beads throughout my hair so I ended up having to wash it all out and throw the product away. Ive used this product for years and this is the first time ive seen it like this. I'm EXTREMELY s disappointed the seller would send an old product."
62,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves a waxy residue,The sent is nauseating. The product leaves a waxy residue after your hair is dry. It does leave your hair very moisturized. I will keep looking.
63,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Definite Curl Holder!,"This stuff is a miracle it works great, amazing scent! It also smells really good every time I use it, I always get compliments on how good my hair smells. It definitely holds your curls and keeps them from frizzing while very moisturizing. Wet your hair and apply a good amount and rake it through. I suggest using a comb so you can easily separate the curls better for more volume. After doing this DONT TOUCH IT, let the hair dry and still don’t touch it or it will frizz!"
64,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for wash and go,I’ve been using this product on my short thick and curly hair for years and people are always asking me what I use. It defines curls and eliminates frizz. Does not dry hard and keeps hair soft. My husband uses it too. Not the best moisturizer but Shea Moisture has other products for that.
65,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed!,"Do you as a vendor and/or manufacturer believe that this terrible product is what I deserve, as a customer?  This product is horrible.  Cakes up and causes flakes.  Does not leave a sheen or softness to the hair.  I expected better!  This product did not come with a plastic bladder/tamper cover under the lid.  What kind of manufacturer omits such, in this day and social climates?  Just an abysmal, disappointing and pathetic experience with vendor/manufacturer.Having read this, Buy at your own prerogative!"
66,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,I have thick curly frizz hair. I was looking for something that would manage my frizz and not leave my hair feeling nasty. I still had frizz and it left my hair feeling nasty for sure. This was an overall no for me
67,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It really does enhance your curls!,"This was the product that helped me discover I actually had curly hair. I apply it with my hair being really wet (not damp but actually wet) and I section my hair. It is very thick so depending on your type of curl is the amount you should use. If you have a more loose curl you don’t need that much product. I recommend also using any of their Gels, they hold the curls for longer but they don’t make your hair crunchy because there medium hold. Since I discover this product I’ve I stopped looking for any other hair cream it is my one and only go to product. Highly recommend it!"
68,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a meh from me,"Really thick, i prefer the curl style milk because its thinner and cheaper. I am currently transitioning from Heat damaged hair and i am trying diferrent products. I have 3-4a hair, though I don’t know exactly my hair type. But I am only 13 yrs old so I have to economize my money. For its price and quantity it brings I dont really like but I do recommend it. I pair it with a gel and my hair looks good. Love the smell tho. It is overhyped though, i have mixed feelings about this product."
69,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT the same!!!,"This is a completely different product than what it has been for the past several years!! If you've been using this, beware that it isn't even remotely close to the same!! It now has a very noticeable and opposite effect. Waste of money!!"
70,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,my hair fell out,"I bought this product and two others, shea moisture black castor oil treatment masque for dry hair and shea moisture strengthen shampoo, used these products for month and my hair literally started to fall out. I discontinued these products and brought another line of products, the maui hair line products and my hair has stopped falling out and doing much better."
71,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,More than expected!,I got so much more in this jar than from any local grocery store or hair supply store for the same cost. I love this product. It mixes well with other gels & does not leave any white residue. It leaves the hair soft with a nice sheen. Smells good too.
72,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy and heavy feeling,Very disappointed in this product.  It is very heavy and greasy...not for fine Caucasian hair.  It did not even make more curls.
73,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap,This feels like it dries my hair out. Maybe Shea Moisture isn’t for me. I really wanted to try it because it was highly recommended and it’s definitely affordable but I guess I’ll have to shed the extra few bucks on other better quality brands because this feels like it was worth about the 8 bucks I paid for it.
74,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Must-Have for Curls,"Finally! After 2 decades of straightening my hair with a flat iron, I decided to embrace my curls (3B). I tried many curl conditioners, but it was still too drying. Seeing all the rave reviews, I am glad I gave it a try! Truly moisturizing with shine. I use this with Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus and you got a winner. The scent is heavenly. Will never use any other product!"
75,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too heavy and thick,"This is very heavy and thick, it leaves my hair oily and wet looking. It isn’t even that great of a moisturizer as hair is still dry feeling with oil film. It also does nothing to enhance curls. I feel I will end up using this as a pre-shower moisturizer rather than a leave in. Positive is that it smells nice..."
76,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful soft curls! New favorite product!,I have naturally curly hair and have a hard time finding products that actually tame frizz like they claim or make hair too crunchy. This Shea cream made my hair look silky beautiful and the curls felt smooth like satin. I love this! It’s my new favorite product.
77,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy quick and versatile,"I like it a lot. It is versatile quick,  and easy to use. Can be applied on wet or dry hair. Helps with frizz and with making waves in my wavy/curly hair look more put together neater shinier and wavier. I don't use too much of it at a time.  Less is more.  It's the only product I use on my hair to style it."
78,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a exact product I’d use on my hair,"This product was good overall, I was all right with the silkyness and the scent. But after I had put it throughout my hair and after it had dryed, my hair was very dry. I didn’t put too much or too little even though it seemed that way because I had to add so much to my hair to get it moisturize that only half of the jar was left. To be honest it could have been my type of hair. Like that my type of hair wasn’t meant for that product but I did not have the best experience with SheaMoisture Smoothie curl enchanting"
79,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Must-Have,"Curly hair holy grail right here. Moisturizing, defining, and it lasts. The only problem I have with it is that the scent it just not for me. I can totally see how others like it, though (It's sweet and coconutty but I don't like the smell of coconut). I noticed the best results when I used it right after I washed my hair when it was still very damp."
80,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,I'm so happy they have this size. I love this product. The smell is amazing and it does the job just right. Be generous when applying. My curls look amazing once it drys.
81,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I saw this product was recommended by Bretman Rock and I’ve been looking for a good hair product for my curly hair for a while so I decided to try it. I immediately threw out every other hair product I owned after using this because it’s amazing. This and their anti-frizz mousse is what I use now.
82,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"Creates nice curls, but is drying. My hair needs moisture, but I found that if a add hair serum into a dollop of this product, it helps. Has a nice smell. Would not purchase again."
83,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonders on curly hair,"I purchase this for my son whose hair is extremely thick and very tightly curled. His hair absorbs moisture like a sponge, and this product helps with moisture retention. Also add shine and texture. I would recommend to others."
84,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor packaging,"This product was delivered, and it wasn't sealed in any way which makes me really hesitant to use it. The lid was almost coming off and there was no seal to keep the product from coming out. It smells good though, which I knew right away because the whole box smells like it lol"
85,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Sheamoisture should have left their products alone!,Sheamoisture has changed something in their products. I used to LOVE them. Now I will not buy them. A real bummer.
86,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,"Amazing product. The scent can be a bit strong so beware if you don’t like the sweet smell of coconut. But the product works just like the description says. It moisturizes and softens my hair. I’m a guy, I have a perm and it does a great job of eliminating the frizz and all around softening my hair. It’s also a very large amount of product. I’m on my second perm, and I haven’t even gotten through half of the product. This will last (depending on length of hair)"
87,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,It works great on my daughters curling hair
88,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not moisturize,"This product does the opposite. It made my hair very dry, and lost its natural shine. I stopped using it after 2 uses."
89,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,*This product has worked great Many but just not for me. It se,"Very different And I was excited to try it after seeing an enthusiastic video review of the product. Personally she’s moisture in general has not been good (at all) for my hair. I have split ends and the product really does not help to smooth or moisturize my hair very well. It has a different smell and after a few hours it’s not very appealing, in my opinion ."
90,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING,OK this is an absolute game changer for me. I have been using a different leave in conditioner product for years and years. It worked pretty good but did not match up to this one even a little bit.This product smells so pretty it leaves my curls soft and shiny. This will definitely be a staple in my routine. I love it so much and highly recommend it

92,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,The smell is amazing but it doesn’t make me have soft bouncy curls. It feels more like a hair gel consistency and my curls dry hard and not very well defined. I have 3b/3c and I don’t think I’ll be repurchasing.
93,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,I use it for my twists or my braids. Keeps my hair moist and shiny. Works well with wet line gel and smells great. I have medium length 4b/4c hair
94,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,"I really like this stuff. And a little bit goes a long way. A couple parts of my hair look dry and don't curl like the rest of my hair, I put a bit of this on and scrunch it up, and it curls like the rest of my hair."
95,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect addition to curly hair regimen,Use enough product through whole head.

I have curly hair and I use it right after washing my hair. I also use it the next day on dry hair to freshen up my hair.  It’s amazing!  I don’t use as much when my hair is dry..  I would start out using less then add more the next time you use it to determine what your hair needs!  Thank you Shea MoistureSmoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair!!!"
97,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not too much hydration on my hair,"In my case, I didn't obtain a great hydratation level.

Yes, it does get rid of your frizzy hair but it also gives you crusty hair, and it’s very hard to brush from all the tangles and crust. I just use a little bit of coconut oil now to get rid of the frizz."
110,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Scalp became an itchy mess.,"I used to buy this years ago no problem, but switched to the Yucca &Plantain shea moisturizer, since they discontinued that version. I bought this one again, this time it caused my scalp to break out into hitchy hives. They must have changed the formula since then. What shame. Do not recommend,  but it smells nice though."

It keeps my hair soft, it's smells amazing, and I don't think there's anything better out there. If you're unsure still, buy one of their 3 oz. bottles before committing to the larger one.

249,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 10 REVIEWER,"This Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie w/ silk protein and neem oil is actually a LEAVE IN treatment, not rinse out. This is according to the directions on the container. The product description on this Amazon web page says differently. Here is the exact working on my container:""Section hair and apply product sparingly to damp or dry hair. Do not rinse out. Style hair as desired. For best results, use as a styling cream for twist-outs, braids and wash-and-go styles. ""I assume a change at some point. So I just wanted to clarify what you will be getting in terms of directions.It is a lovely product. I imagine it is extra great for those with tighter curl patterns. It seems to both moisturize and provide a little hold. Calms frizz. I happen to have a mix of textures. Some straight, some wavy, some cork screws. I have long nearly waist length hair, so much of the curl is pulled out from weight. Any shorter bits curl rather tightly. I would include pics, but at this time the photo loader isn't appearing on my screen. I will keep checking back as I did take pics of the bottle as well as my hair. EDIT: came back to add pictures. Sorry, the cap to my bottle was broken and I keep contents in with plastic wrap and a rubber band.It is a 12 ounce container, and since a little goes a long way, this should last awhile. I have used it on wet hair, and I have used it on dry. My hair is a little crunchy once it dries on dry hair, haven't felt that when it has been applied to wet. It is a good (for me)  SCRUNCH & PLOP product. After shampoo & conditioner, I get out of shower and lightly towel dry hair (either with towel or cotton t-shirt). I bend over to let my hair hang upside down, I emulsify a bit between both hands then scrunch it in. Scrunch scrunch, scrunch some more. Then between the pre towel drying and the scrunch action, my hair is semi dry. I then plop it into a t-shirt for a bit to help hold the scrunch. OR, if I was one to use a hair dryer, I would then proceed with that. Keep scrunching. It doesn't dry crunchy, so not much more is needed.  I would consider a light hold gel on top to continue to the scrunch and to help it hold even further.. but all that added stuff is up to you. It is totally nice on its own- whether for super curly hair, or even as a nice smoother for straight to lightly wavy. Run a little over your hair to keep fly aways in place and to help control frizziness from humidity.I've always had good luck with Shea Moisture products. Quality formulas at a budget friendly price. I would recommend this. I think it is versatile enough to be worth a try."

471,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My hair is a mix of 2C waves and 3A curls. I have a LOT of hair. And I have yet to find an all-in-one product that will shape and define my curls, add moisture without too much grease and prevent frizz. For me, this product was a great all-over first step, but it didn’t accomplish everything on my list.On wash day, I sectioned off my hair (just top and bottom) and applied this product. Then I scrunched to work it in and start to define curls. Diffused until my hair was about half dry, just to see how it was looking. Result was a bit puffier than I would like, and curls weren’t especially well-defined. So I added a small amount of my favorite standby curl definition product, particularly near the ends, and a little bit of an all-over texturizing cream that works really well for me on about the bottom half. Then I diffused it until it was all the way dry.Some observations:* The top of my head, which ONLY had this product applied on it, definitely started off greasier than I would normally like it to be right after a wash. So I think maybe that any product that promises “moisture” like this one perhaps just isn’t well suited to being applied so close to the crown of my head.* The rest of my hair looks good, but it is definitely “wetter” looking than normal.* My hair is touchably soft. Absolutely no crispiness at all. Big thumbs up there.* This product smells AMAZING. Legit like dessert.* A little bit goes a long way. I have a ton of hair and I used maybe the equivalent of three quarter-sized dollops to coat all of it. The jar this comes in is HUGE, so this will last a very long time.I’ve tried a LOT of curl creams, from all over the brand and price spectrum. This product is a solid offering in the curl cream category, without a doubt. And given its price and size, it’s a fantastic value.Overall, I’m really happy with my results after using this product. For me, it wasn’t the be-all, end-all solution I’ve been searching for, but that’s OK. I have some proven standby products that are best used sparingly, anyway, and this product is a great base to start from. Can’t win them all, but this come pretty close!"
472,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First: This product smells wonderful! It smells like vanilla and pineapple. My husband, who cares little about these things, smelled it and said, “I want to eat some!” So, keep an open container away from children!Second: It says on the container to apply to dry or damp hair and leave it. I did that. My wavy mousy brown hair then looked like it needed a wash very badly. It did not “enhance” my waves or make them more curly like similarly named products that I use to good effect.Third: I got online and saw that it says here to apply to wet hair after shampooing, leave on for three minutes and rinse. Hmm. SheaMoisture, you’ve confused me! Since my hair looked pretty awful, followed these directions. It did a beautiful job as a conditioner; left my hair shiny and soft. Did nothing to “enhance curls,” but I can’t knock it for what it did do.The thing is, it doesn’t do as advertised, but I’m using this instead of my conditioner until I use up the container. Then I might try another of their products for the scent alone.Do I recommend it? If you don’t have a good conditioner and you like the smell of pineapple."
473,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,No longer think and mositerzing as it once was. Formula change.,Shea Moisture sold out! This new formulation is nothing like the orginal.  It thinner and runny. The old formula was so thick that you could hold the container upside down and nothing would fall out.  Now it's a runny soupy meal that's no as heavely moisturizing as it once was. I knew the company jumped shipped when I saw people with non type 4 or 3 hair using it. The older formulation was much too heavy for thinner non kinky curly hair textures.  Shea moisture tried being all inclusive and left out the people that got them to where they are. Also the company is no longer black owned and now uses cheaper ingredients since it's become a corporate entity.  I haven't bought any shea moisture products in years since they sold out their main customer base.

I have regularly somewhat curly hair, but when I don’t use a curly hair product, it is super flat. This product did wonders to my hair!! For one, look at those curls in that photo! And look how cute that curl is on the side. I was shocked! The product itself smells AMAZING. It’s like a coconut and tropical fruit mix. I’m obsessed! The bottle has sooo much product so I don’t think I’ll ever run out (which I’m not complaining!) I put this in my ends and it didn’t feel like it was weighing down my hair!

The texture is similar to a deep conditioner. It has a coconut-heavy fragrance. You don't need to use much for this to work. I've found that it's better to apply it to damp hair vs wet. This is a great product for braid-outs and twist-outs. I  highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

477,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have very thin, but SUPER dry wavy hair and have been still looking for a great product that will help foster that natural curl. I especially have trouble getting my waves to continue at the root. I have heard of this product in curly girl groups and was excited to try it, although the consensus seems to be that this brand is ""too heavy"" for wavies and thin hair. I didn't have that experience at all. I know personally my hair is extremely dry - I only need to wash once or twice a week and have never had greasy hair in my life. When applying, I trusted my gut and used quite a bit of this product rather than using it sparsely, knowing my hair loves moisture.The results were fantastic. As my hair is actually quite fine and thin, I went for volume and curl formation versus definition and clumping in my wash/dry routine and diffused until completely dry.  I could REALLY tell a difference in the formation of my curls - my hair was more curlier than normal and much more curls at the root. I've used other curl creams and haven't seen this type of results before. The product has no cast or crunchiness - it really makes for soft curls. Mine held great even next-day, but my hair holds pretty well anyway. Others might need a gel or mousse to go with it. Next time I want to try a gel with it so I can see if I get a bit more definition. The product smells great and has a lot of slip. It's really a great product and I do think it lives up to the ""curl enhancing"" part of the name."
478,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Both my young daughter and I have really long, waist length curly hair so I'm always on the lookout for new curly girl products for us. SheaMoisture is a recognizable, good brand that always offers great products. This was no exception. There's a ton of product that comes in the large tub. Its a fairly thick cream formula that is kind of hard to scoop out with nails on (lol) but not hard to apply. I get a little on my palm and rub my hands together before applying it to slightly moistened hair, section by section. It has a light scent that reminds me of the tropics. Coconut, fruity and floral.Once in the hair and dried, it enhances and preserves our natural curl patterns. I don't need to do any manual twirling or use any curling tools to ""make"" the curls happen. The hair and curls are bouncy, flexible, tamed with little to no frizz, and not crunchy at all. My daughter's preschool teacher is always saying how pretty her hair is and even stopped me one morning to complement me and tell me how she and her assistant teacher admire our hair.I'm very happy with the performance of this product, and highly recommend it"
479,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As others have mentioned, there is some inconsistency with regard to using this product- the product jar says to leave the conditioner in and the product page says to rinse. I think this SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie can be used either way, depending on your hair type. Those with dry hair or those with tighter curls will probably like this better as a leave-in to moisturize and define curls vs those with fine/thin hair that tends to get oily may prefer to rinse it out. I fall into the latter camp. When used in the shower and after rinsing, this lovely smelling conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and helps to reduce the frizzy flyaways from my long wavy hair."
480,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 500 REVIEWER,"There are many good things about this cream, but it has an over-powering negative. This cream has a very strong scent. A powerful sweet vanilla scent.  I did not like the scent or the strength of the aroma. I like vanilla scent in general; it was this version of the scent that got to me.On the positive side, I was surprised that the tub was bigger than I expected. It worked well, giving my curls more definition without making them stiff or sticky.However, the scent was a deal-breaker; after putting it on, I had to wash my hair in a couple of hours to get rid of the scent.Ali Julia review"

I have curly course, dry, frizzy hair, but it's not super thick, so I was worried this would be too much for my hair and would weigh it down.The first time I used it, I used too much, and it did leave a bit of a yucky feel to my hair, but with just the right amount, it's awesome. So, you just have to adjust according to your hair.I do think this is a great product for curly heads (and maybe just for frizzy heads, too). :)  Oh, and the scent is so nice! Sometimes I open the jar just to take a whiff."

Think classic ""Jew Fro"". I have been growing my hair out since February (9+ months), and it tends to get dry and crispy if I go to long without deep conditioning. Lately I have been trying all sorts of regimens to keep my hair nourished, healthy, and happy. I've tried at least a dozen products, and this shea moisture leave-in product blows everything else clean out of the water. My curls are naturally springy and well formed without that crunchy gel feeling, my hair is dark and shiny, and it smells really nice. No oily residue on my pillow or other surfaces my hair comes into contact with, and I don't have to use a ton, even though my hair does tend to drink up product. Better yet, this is an industrial sized vat that should last me for months to come. I think I've found my go-to long term curl care product! Highly recommended!"
483,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This 12 oz tub of curl enhancing smoothie is going to last so long!  I love this brand for both their products and their values.This smells like a tropical beach vacation. The coconut really comes through but not in an offputting or artificial way.  The cream is like a thick lotion and it does not take much at all.  In fact, I made the mistake of using too much one time and it really looked bad so just start with small amounts and slowly add more if needed.This can be applied to damp or dry hair, I usually put it in after I’ve washed and towel dried my hair.  It offers a lot of shine and enhances my natural curls.  It’s also done a great job at taMing my frizz!"

Such rave reviews, but sure, if you like crispy, greasy-looking hair that looks like you never left the 80s behind… This stuff is terribly expensive, but, I thought I should use a product specifically designed for enhancing curls, after years of just diluting my conditioner and using that as a leave-in, and using Carol’s Daughter Mimosa Hair Honey. With this horrific “smoothie,” my hair was dry as the Sahara no matter how much product I put in, and it was sticky!  It got so horribly tangled and glued together with this junk.  I am used to my hair looking shiny and healthy, and feeling soft to the touch. I wish I could return this smoothie junk and get my money back.  Back to my old combo, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!"

I've experimented with multiple ways of using this, and I don't know why, but it just doesn't work at all for my coarse, thick, dry, damaged, curly/wurly hair.I'm so disappointed that this hasn't worked at all for me, but for whatever reason, it's just horrible for my hair."

It works wonders on our daughter's hair, and we love how well it works on our daughter's type 2c hair. It is a bit on the heavier side for her hair type, but if we use it sparingly, it does a great job! The container is huge and it will last us a really love time, so I would say this would be great for a family, frankly. The scent is nice - not too heavy, but it does have a good amount of scent via fragrance, which means we have no clue what it is... I don't love that it is not the cleanest ingredient listing, but not too bad overall. This works really well for us, and I am happy."

I have found Shea Moisture products to be so effective at cutting the frizz and making my hair moisturized. I noticed a clear, recognizable difference, even after the first day of using the product.It smells great, and it applies easily to my damp hair. It leaves my hair smelling good, too, but it's not overwhelming and it does fade over time. The smoothie also doesn't weigh down my hair or leave it feeling sticky or clumpy like other products I've used. It's great!It's also a nice big bottle, and I love the screw on lid. I am less likely to spill it. It's a good value, too!Overall, I can't be happier with the way this product shapes, defines, and tames my curls.

490,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I am such a huge fan of the coconut and hibiscus curl enhancing milk from this brand! It's perfect for my thick, wavy long hair, and keeps all of those little frizzy flyaway hairs in check so that I look smooth and professional all day.When I saw that there was a thicker smoothie product in the same line as my curl enhancing milk, I definitely wanted to try it. This is just like the curl enhancing milk and how it works, only it is a little bit thicker. I don't know why, but some days I just have a sense that my hair is needing a little bit of extra care, maybe because I was in the sun and wind too much the day before or maybe I just rinsed my conditioner out to thoroughly, but on those days I use this product instead of the milk and it does the same excellent job of keeping my braid in check and keeping any of the hair that popped out of my braid looking curly and sleek rather than like a frizzy mess.I also love how this stuff smells. It smells just like my curl enhancing milk, a beautiful fragrance of coconuts with just a hint of gentle tropical floral, but really primarily I small coconuts. Definitely recommend this product as well as the curl enhancing milk."

I can't say that I'm totally in love with it because I feel like it could work a bit better in terms of softening. Then too, it could just be my hair texture but this wasn't the best product for me. However, when using it on others, it turned out to work well. It smells good and doesn't leave a film or build up that makes your scalp itch. I just say proceed with caution. If you're a product junkie, this will probably end up in your supply anyway."

I figured they'd updated the look but I got the same old packaging they've had for years. The product itself is the same as I remember. I use it on my daughter's type 4b hair. Anything else would be too costly on her long, thick hair at this point. It moisturizes well, although it's not the best for curl definition, at least not for type 4 hair. Looser hairtypes (including non-black types) may get better definition. For us it just provides moisture, which I expected, so I can't be disappointed."

This product is very thick but smells amazing. I’ve used it a few times now and I have to say it really makes my curls come out to play. I have 2b-2c thick curly hair. I do not follow the CGM because I don’t keep my hair curly during the winter just summer while it’s humid and my hair is colored. Even so this still helps being out my curl clumps. The only thing I hate about it is that it doesn’t help my frizz what so ever. I use all salon approved shampoos and conditioners because I have colored hair.

Further, as promised, it did not make my hair shine ornate it feel moisturized.  My hair felt dry after I applied it.  The kicker is that it caused my scalp to burn.

The jar instructions say this is a leave-in product. I have fine hair, and I have always found leave-in products weigh my hair down, so I decided to use this as a conditioner, rinsing it out after three minutes. Also I think the scent would be over-whelming if you don’t rinse it out.It left my hair very soft with much more volume.  This might work as a leave-in for very heavy or ethnic type hair but I think for average hair it would be much too heavy."

The scent is a little strong for my tastes but not so strong that I cant (or wont) use it.  It helps cut down on the frizz and helps keep my hair from drying out.  My curls are so much more defined with this.  I do need to add a sealing type product on top to keep the curls but this acts as my moisturizing layer.  Best of all, it has no silicones.  It is a little expensive at the current price of $17, but a little goes a long way so the cost is worth it in the long run in my opinion."

It does calm down the frizzies which I get around my ears for some reason, and I don't like them sticking out of my ball cap, haha. It is a bit heavy and I don't find that it enhances curl much, which in my case is good. I have shoulder length hair and after washing it gets very curly. I've never had curly hair before, so that's perplexing. I usually use a flat iron for a smoother look. This is OK, but I think  I've used better for my tastes."
504,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My hair is wavy and my daughter and grandson have curly hair and we all three use this to keep our hair conditioned and under control. It leaves our hair soft and silky and it smells so good! We live in the south where heat and humidity can be an issue year round, but it's no longer an issue with this curl enhancing smoothie."
505,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Substantial Smoothing Cream With a Great Fragrance,"I really like this curl smoothing cream. It's got a light and very lovely, slight sweet fragrance and does NOT smell like Neem oil at all. Because of all the ingredients, it is a fairly substantial and thick cream, so a little bit goes a long way.I've been using natural products on my very curly hair, and the reduction of chemicals has really made the texture better. Very pleased with this natural product."
506,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Great Moisturizes Better,"Pineapples and vanilla - that is what this smells like. It is a pleasant scent, but strong so if you are sensitive to smell, please be aware.My hair is porous 3B/C hair and my hair just loves this stuff. The other cream leave-in I use is Cantu, but I like this so much more than that.It is weightless in my hair, makes it smell good, moisturizes like crazy and absorbs well so it doesn't lay on my hair like oils do.I've tried many products in this line and all have worked well, but I think this is my favorite."
507,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have short to medium curly hair and applied a little bit of this cream to my damp locks. After working this through, I let my hair air dry. This conditioned without weighing down my curls. It also tamed the frizz. The fragrance is wonderful. The cream is thick. Of course, this does make my hair look darker than normal as a result of putting a product in my hair.  The current price of $17.99 is competitive but some local stores do carry this for a lesser price."
508,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really heavy-duty conditioner.  If you have thin, fine hair... run like the wind. If you have thick, curly, coarse or just thick hair that needs a strong conditioner, you should like this product!  It smells great and made my hair so soft.  It was not too heavy at all, but can see that it could be too heavy for people with thin, fine hair.  If you have thick hair - you'll love it! ~Amy"
509,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not by itself,"Doesn't work on its own:  not enough definition, anti-frizz, or control, and it feels a little greasy. Mixed in a cocktail though with Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard, it works MARVELOUSLY! Used about 1/2 of each, mix well before applying. Applied to DRIPPING WET hair using the praying hands method.My hair type: Low porosity, 2C, medium-coarse, long"
510,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing!,I didn’t expect much but this is very moisturizing! It’s not thick it spreads very easily in your hand so you can apply a small amount on a lot of your hair. I didn’t see much curling occurring when i first used it. I watched a YouTube tutorial on doing a sleek bun and a curling product similar was used so i found this to be a perfect product for moisturizing my hair and combining with gels for a sleek but curly hairstyle. I have kinky curly type 4 hair.
511,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have very curly hair that’s just past my shoulders. I love using this as a deep conditioner once a week and can get 4-5 applications when generously used. I wash my hair and apply a nice amount, quickly comb though and put my heated head wrap on, leaving it over night sometimes. Then, cool rinse in the morning and my hair is very manageable. I’ve used several of the SheaMoisture products and have had great success without spending a ton of money. The only thing is the scent, I like the scent but it’s a tad strong for me."
512,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Type 3b Hair,I'm currently growing out a pixie cut and transitioning to natural hair after straightening my hair everyday for over 10 years. I'm learning which products are good for my curly hair to keep them looking good and shiny without the dry crunchiness that some products cause. I really like this product because a little goes a long way. I use a small amount of product and comb through my hair before stying and letting it air dry. I love the sweet smell of this product and love how great it makes my hair smell.
513,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this on my blonde weave that was dry, and is not anymore after using this.Since using this on my hair it blows out smooth, and has allot of body.On the jar it says to use this as a leave in on damp or dry hair without rinseing out..Although on Amazon it says toLeave this on for 3 mins then rinse out, that I didn’t do.This coconut and hibiscus curl enhancing smoothie works better for my hair then Pureology shampoo and conditioner .Great price for 10.19 for a large jar."
514,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff smells so yummy and works great. I have curly hair and follow the curl girl routine, and this works wonderfully as a cream after I shower. I apply the product when my hair is damp, and it’s helped to define the curl and reduce frizz without leaving my hair greasy. It does say this can be applied to dry hair also, but I haven’t tried that. It’s fairly thick and I feel like greasiness would ensue if applied on dry hair."
515,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Me fascina,"Es la primera vez que usé este producto y me gustó mucho,  me deja el pelo suave, sedoso, brillante, me ayuda a controlar el Freeze las puntas me dejaron impresionada porque normalmente después del cepillado siempre tocaba plancharlas y esta vez divinas desde el principio. Lo seguiré usamdo, Creo que será el nuevo mejor amigo de mi cabello."
516,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for curly hair,The smell sometimes might take some getting used to as it is an overly fruity aroma. Leaves hair feeling soft and not too gunky. Does well with my curls. I'd recommend using a mousse for best results. One of the better leave-in conditioners for my  type of hair that I've had a hard time finding.
517,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes curly hair look yummy,Smells amazing but a bit strong. This product is definitely CURLY HAIR APPROVED! Wont dry out your hair and or cast. Curls look amazing especially when applying (generously if hair is more curly)on soak and wet hair then letting it air dry or defusing. I find the price to be cheaper at Walmart. Out of their line of products this is definitely a must have.
518,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,Ok I was skeptical about this but it truly is a great product for my hair. I used it today when I received it yesterday and I must say I truly am very pleased with the outcome. I have natural curls that are tight curls and everything that I have tried dried up within an hour of use and I would have to reapply or wear a hat. I can say that I have had a complete day of moisture in my hair. I am truly impressed and will keep this in my supply of hair supplies.
519,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly blonde hair too,"I get it at my local Sallys- it's a buck or two cheaper than on here. I love this stuff. I have mid back length, white blonde (naturally) 2c/3a hair. Kinda a weird hair type, and it's almost impossible to get a product that makes it manageable, but this stuff works for it. I can put half an average size bottle of conditioner in my hair, and it still wouldn't be soft. This helps get rid of a lot of the tangles and makes it touchable. How i use it, it actually dampens my curls a lil most of the time initially, but they pop back up as soon as it dries."
520,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,good for curls,"It really does enhance your curls. For some reason, my hair does not keep moisture. After a couple of hours, my hair feels dry again. It smells really good. The texture of the product is really thick. I thought that due to it being thick it will moisturize my hair really good. I'll try it with water to see if that is any better for me."
521,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"Finally accepting my curly/wavy hair.  This is a must, keeps hair from getting frizzy.  Smells great.  I tried the same brand in the ""milk"" and it didn't cut it for me."
522,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Softened my hair,"She’s moisture is one of my favorite brands. A lot of the formulas have changed and I don’t think they work as well anymore but this one was spot on. It left my hair feeling smooth, soft, very moisturized. My curls really pop with this too."
523,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like Vomit!,This product has made my hair feel more dry than any cheap store product has ever. My curls are usually tight and bouncy and now they are loose and hard. AND oh my God the smell this stuff smells like Vomit it is nauseating i didn't notice it on day 1 but I woke up this morning to use it and I cant get the smell off my hands and I had to wash it out of my hair because the smell would not dissipate. I wish I had seen the comments saying they had changed the formula before buying.
524,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the Hype,"Oh my goodness, I can’t say enough good things about this. I avoided it for a long time because I have low porosity hair and I was afraid it would be too much protein. I finally tried the small version when I ran out of my DevaCurl cream and I am never going to use anything else. My curls have never looked better - I didn’t even realize my curls could be this defined. The smell is -very- strong, and if you have low porosity hair, you may have to start clarifying more often than you’re accustomed to, but it’s so worth it."
525,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the amount,This is a great product and much much cheaper than in the stores.  I paid a bit less for almost double the volume of the product.  We will be purchasing it again and again.
526,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Moisture,I love Shea Moisture products and have been using Curl Smoothie a long time. It's the perfect moisturizer for my dry coarse hair. I use it with the matching shampoo and conditioner 👍🏼🥰
527,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Smoothie for Natural hair Do's,I love the hold for my twist- out or coil hair do's. It is moisturizing and the scent is delicious. In addition it holds the frizz level down. (Big Plus) I have started twisting my sons hair. They are also pleased with the end result.
528,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works like a charm.,It curls wet hair perfectly. But it has a really strong smell so if that’s something you will find irritating don’t get it.

This one works okay, but didn't leave my curls feeling ""smoothed"" out.  Although to be fair I live in the South where the humidity is unforgiving."
530,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was not surprised that this product would smell amazing.

531,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I've been using this as soon as I get out of the shower, when my hair is still soaking wet. It helps to create really nice curl clumps and dries beautifully. It's not great on refreshing already dried curls though. The smell is fantastic!"
532,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Deceiving products and brand.,My entire family uses Shea Moisture line of products. We used them because we believed this product was made for black hair by black people. We were sadly mistaken. This line may smell great but it does not do well in course hair and does not retain moisture. This product line is truly deceiving people my family and I will never support this company again.

I find even when I use a very small amount it leaves my hair feeling really greasy, sticky, and oddly dry. It’s so heavy on your hair and it just feels like I forgot to wash out a hair mask. I wouldn’t recommend."

560,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It gives you curls when you don't have any.,"This is so far the only product that gives me curls without frizz. All my life I needed to blow dry and flat iron my hair until I saw a video on youtube on this product. I have three months using this product. I used to buy it for $17.99 at a store when I saw it was $10 I brought it right away. I was worried about the reviews on the packaging, but it came in perfect condition.Directions on how I use it:After rising the deep condition, I apply vitamin E oil. Then, I split my hair in sections and apply the smoothie. The last thing I do to it is apply a sculpting gel level 3. However, the smoothie itself should be enough. If I'm going to sleep, I put my hair in twists or braids. The next day I take them off and refresh it.Please note: if you never done curls like me please use a deep condition and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner."

It feels very sticky, I can’t even brush through my hair once using the product, on top of that it leaves my hair dry and staticky. Maybe my hair is too fine for it, but this was not a good product for me, will be returning"

563,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rich Moisturizing Product,"I used this once and I must admit, it's a great product. My hair is very thick and dries out quickly. I can use this every other day and I have deep rich curls and I can comb it so easily.  I suggest put it in your hair take a steamy shower and see the luscious curls."

This product definitely helps enhance curl but weighed down my hair from having any volume. The directions do say to use it sparingly, and I used it extremely sparingly and still had the problem of it weighing down and not having any volume. So the product does what it's suppose to but I would not recommend if you have fine hair."

I have 3c, high porosity, spiral curly hair and it really defines and softens my curls. Not greasy at all. Product dries nicely and doesn’t leave an ashy white overcast.

This is the Mom's responsibility to both protect the child and to ensure his hair is entangled.Thank you for listening."

615,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excelente for styling 2C/3A hair. The only issue is, if you have fine thin hair it weighs your hair down and makes it really sticky. I really love the definition this product gives me as well as the hold. A little goes a long way. I find it works well on dry hair and on wet hair. This product smells great and is not too thick or watery. It has a nice consistency, but probably better on thicker hair."

620,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I needed,"This stuff is AMAZING. I have a lot of fine, low-porosity 3B curly hair, and this product is my new favorite when it comes to styling. The texture, to be completely honest, isn’t my favorite because it’s so thick and just feels kind of gross when I’m scooping it out of the container, but boy does my hair ever like it, and that’s enough for me. It leaves my hair extremely moisturized and smooth, and it gives me SUCH GOOD SLIP, so detangling is a breeze. I typically use my Denman brush after applying this smoothie, and it leaves me with the softest, most defined curls ever. It’s not heavy on my hair once it dries, either. (I’ve also used it before doing my hair in a protective braided style, and that turned out super hydrated and healthy-feeling as well.) Highly recommend for anyone with hair like mine—trust me, it’s popular for a reason!!"
621,"Sheamoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 20 oz",Size: 12 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Extremely sad as the products spilled all over. Out of the 3 tubs i bought, 2 spilled messily which made the unspilled one really greasy as well. Very upset and hope the seller can improve on quality control of product packaging. I ordered more from the same seller after this purchase and in the past as well. Giving this a 4 star as previous ones came in good condition and shipping time was good. Ordered on 3rd April, received on 10th April. But please improve on product protection in future and thank u for the hard work!As for the product itself, it does really well and leaves my curls soft and mangeable. I have 2c-3a hair"
0,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,CHANGED INGREDIENTS! NO LONGER SULFATE FREE!!! DO NOT BUY,"Shea Moisture is still advertising that this product is sulfate free. You can see they changed the formula and have removed the NO SULFATES as well as removing No Parafin,  No Propylene Glycol (they now have alcohol in this product!!), No Synthetic Fragrance, No Synthetic Color, and No DEA . Super disappointed as I really loved the way this made my hair feel and now with the addition of more alcohols, more vegetable oil, sulfates and other less than ideal ingredients that I do not want to put in my hair. Companies are just getting greedy and trying to cut corners to save money but charge us the same for products that will do more damage than good. NO THANKS."
1,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Great For Making Hair More Curly,"I'm so glad that I started using this product line. From my experience, this is the best hair product for making my hair more curly and less dry. I've tried a lot of hair products over the years, as my hair is dry, coarse, and unruly. I have a few calics in my hair, and it's always been challenging to style. Since the recent pandemic, I haven't been to a hair salon in some time and my wife has been giving me home haircuts. I've let my hair grow in the top and tried a number of hair products to make my hair curly. This product line is the best for my hair and I've purchased a number of their products recently. I find their products give my hair moisture and make it more curly. Love their products and highly recommend them."
2,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Never again,I can’t even speak about how this actually works because I can’t get beyond the smell. It’s terrible. Even using the teeniest bit of the product I got a headache from the icky sweet smell that wouldn’t go away. It’s way too strong and will overpower everything else around you. I literally couldn’t smell my food because of this stuff in my hair and everywhere I went people asked what was that “weird candy smell”?  The headache I had from using it lasted for days after washing it out. I’ll never wear this again. Do not buy!
3,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Low Porosity Curl Smoothie,"Love this for my low porosity 4a/4b Hair. My hair is so soft, curly, and moisturized after using this curl smoothie. I also do the LCO method on my hair and it performs well. Even 2-3 days after a twist out, my hair is so soft!"
4,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but never getting it from them again!!","I have been using this line of products for a few months now, and can attest to how great the actual product works. I also use the shampoo and conditioner that accompany this leave in conditioner and my hair is so soft and the frizz is down. I have a good hair day almost every day!!That being said, the product was opened before I even got it. It had spilled all through the bag it was in.I have pictures I will add if I can figure that out."
5,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a miracle product for curly hair,"I love this product! My hair is very long, thick, hard to manage and goes from being wavy and frizzy to very curly and defined depending on the day/weather and it’s mood. I’ve tried so many products at so many price points it’s exhausting and expensive. I don’t usually use anything on dry/damp hair or on hair that’s not freshly washed because it’s never worked for me, my hair usually just goes limp or gets crunchy or greasy. I kept seeing this product on curly blogs so I finally bought it. It took awhile to arrive so I had kind of forgotten about it by the time it did. First off, the container is HuGe! It will probably last me the rest of my life. For real. I’ve used it on my hair soaking wet before I get out of the shower (the curly method) and I’ve been courageous and used it on second and third day hair that’s gotten flat/frizzy. ITS AMAZING! On second and third day hair I dampen my hair a bit, apply a nickel sized amount to my palms and do the “praying hands” and my curls are bouncier and more defined and shiny than they have been in years! No crunch, no greasiness! It’s incredible! I didn’t know my curls could look so good. I’ve even done it in dry hair. It’s not as beautiful but it’s still quite good. The smell is wonderful as well."
6,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"ALRIGHT, HERE'S THE INGREDIENTS Y'ALL!","This item is the same exact item as they used to sell in the small tubes (kudos to you shea moisture for going more eco friendly!) I am glad I can just buy one big jar instead of a bunch of small tubes that are hard to recycle.I had asked a question on this listing, about the ingredients. Someone answered saying that it broke their hair off- I can say as someone who has used SHEA MOISTURE products for almost a decade AND AS A PROFESSIONAL STYLIST licensed in the state of ks that no, there is nothing in this product that would've damaged your hair. In fact, the reason why I love this product line is that I find it to be much better than a lot of products you buy at a salon!!!! Their products contain nourishing ingredients that ACTUALLY WORK. A lot of the pro stuff is overpriced, overscented, and just isn't really that great tbh. I love this one for my wavy hair, I put it in after showering and towel drying then I scrunch it and it has enough hold to bring out the curl but it isn't crunchy at all and leaves the hair feeling soft. I am also sensitive to fragrances, and this one isn't bad at all. Sorry to the person who had the damaged hair, but that happened because your hair was already damaged.Also, a note to the manufacturer, who also answered my question about the ingredients - saying that they were listed in the images. They are not, and in fact, your listing pictures state this product contains mushrooms when it doesn't. So you might want to fix that :)"

I'm expected to return this? The box arrived soggy and when I opened it I found out why. The conditioner was completely smashed open and a mess.I'm hoping I will get a refund but it seems I'm expected to send the product back.

9,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizer & curl definition product,"Great moisturizer! It defines my curls. It even tames my hair. My hair isn't frizzy at the end of the day and it's easier to manage when using this product. I use this product only when I wear ponytails; it gives it a really nice shiny slick look. I don't use it when I wear it free of ponytails because it's a bit heavy. I use other products for my natural curly bob. However, my daughter uses it for everything...her hair is thicker and she's a 3b and I'm a 3a not sure if that matters. I really dislike the smell but it doesn't bother my daughter. Hope this helps someone."

I have never seen this size in the store so I was super excited to find this on Amazon. Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie is a holy grail product of mine. I'm a Hairbox subscriber so I get lots of products every month but I MUST ALWAYS have this smoothie on hand no matter what. I love the scent, the thickness & the way it makes my natural curls pop."
14,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I have 4c hair and this softened my hair
15,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Perfect,THIS STUFF IS SO AMAZING. Omg like it just makes my hair look so damn good! I let my hair towel/air dry and then comb this stuff through and finish with OGX coconut curl mousse & it’s like magic. Before buying the bigger size I tried a smaller bottle of this stuff and for some reason the smaller bottle smells really weird; this one smells waaay better. I 100% recommend this if you have curly/wavy hair and want your hair to look smooth and frizz free!
16,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A miracle for my Caucasian curls without the grease,"So I've been experimenting with products over the years to tame my frizzy curly locks & have hated my hair more years of my life than I care to admit. But after moving to South Florida and having to give up the hair straightening iron due to 100% humidity down here I started a journey to research the best products for Caucasian curly hair. Because let's just be real here our curly hair is composed up differently and needs imo less greasy products. Every curly hair product I've found either was to brittle and drying or too greasy. I stumbled upon a some YouTube videos about this curly head method or something like that and one of them recommended this product. So what I do is I just condition my hair I use regular conditioner as shampoo and a deep condition once or twice a week to really condition. With head flipped upside-down soaking wet in the shower I apply a leave in, TGIN thank God it's natural makes a good one, then I apply this & scrunch a little to get rid of excess water. With head still upside-down I take a tshirt and scrunch the excess water out after I get out. Then apply a hard cheap gel with lots of hold scrunch more and wrap my head with the tshirt(search YouTube of how to use tshirt to wrap curly hair to dry). I let that sit on my head for however long anywhere between 30 minutes and a couple of hours not usually a couple hours I would say 30 minutes to an hour and then I let it all out and let it air dry or defuse the rest of the way when it’s mostly dry with a bout 80 to 85% dry I scrunch it with the T-shirt while it’s upside down and I put my fingers through like my scalp and I just kind of shake the hair and scrunch it kind of break it up if it’s hard at all  and then Wala it’s done. to me this is a miracle product I am in love with it I would never try anything else because I’m 100% happy with it for myself and my  curls. it smells so good my husband loves the way it smells sweet and fruity. I would say that I use a decent amount like I would say a tablespoon or so I usually scoop out a little on my 3 fingers for my medium length hair. It will feel slippery kind of but when is all said and done the look will look like the picture I uploaded. Obviously all of our hair is so different that’s why I did I mention in my title that it was for my Caucasian hair and I mean Caucasian hair is not on the same either but this stuff works for me, I would consider my hair normal as in not too greasy or dry. The curls as average not super tight kinky curls not really loose. if I were to just air dry my hair without anything it would poof out a little bit I would have some curl to it and it would look a hot mess with extra frizz lol. Hope this helps and if you still need more help with your curls I recommend searching YouTube. Good luck!"
17,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells DELICIOUS, But the Hype is Too High","It smells GREAT, but that is about all that I can say about it. I bought this to help add moisture to my hair but it just made it greasy. I tried using it more than once because the fragrance is so sensational that I cannot bear to just throw it away. The first time, I used it right after my leave-in as a heavier moisturizer and layered it with my hair butter. My hair was greasy but dry the next day. The next time I tried, I used it instead of my hair butter, but my hair ended up just dry and not greasy this time. Finally I tried it without a leave-in and without hair butter. Still a no-go; it didn’t want to absorb right and was difficult to work in under all circumstances I have tried. What a shame; I just can’t get over the smell. I might just try mixing it with aloe vera to help with the moisture, but I can’t say it will change anything. I have to pass on repurchasing."
18,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very economical.,I have used for 8 years now buying the 12 oz size.So this 20 oz container of the curl enhancing smoothie is very economical for $15.99 some places are charging that for 12 oz jar.I plan to buy 2 more jars.
19,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!,"I can’t live without this! After washing & conditioning and lightly towel drying, I comb through my 2B waves with a very wide-tooth pick, them put a dollop of the Shea Moisture in my hands with a little water, rub between my hands then work through my hair repeating several times to cover all hair. My hair is pretty wet at this point. I then scrunch my hair gently with a microfiber towel and either air dry or use diffuser set on low. My waves turn out soft, shiny and with no frizz! On days I don’t want to wash my hair, I do the same routine but on dry hair that I have run through with the hair pick. I just use a little less product. Same result! Awesome. (Smells great too!)"
20,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great but product itself is not that great,"First time trying this product and I was not too happy with the curl cream:( I have been looking for a drug store product to replace the dove mouse that I used to use but not seems like it’s discontinued or the formula has changed .the smell of the product is absolutely amazing but that might be the only thing I love  about it , the product itself leaves your hair weighed down and lacking shine . I have very curly hair that needs something light weigh to keep the curl shape and maybe reduce frizz but this dosent do either :( I was pretty excited to try this after reading good reviews but sadly it’s a no from me . >>>picture with the blue sweater shows my hair with my old product and the first picture  shows hair with the sheamoisture cream <<<"

It DOES take practice, but it leaves my hair curly and smelling better than those other products pushed on us!"
22,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for natural hair,My hair is naturally curly and I like this product for the moisturizer that it provides my hair not to heavy and it holds my curls in place. I have used many products but I have found this to be the best. As well as the kids products I use those as well.
23,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not my cup of tea.,I have curly short blonde hair that's a little damaged only at my tips even though I did cut it because I only died the tips blonde. But I bought this to bounce my curls after buying the shea moisture shine shampoo & conditioner..At first it worked than it started to tangle my hair & it become into knots that was hard to untangle no matter how much conditioner I applied to my hair. I cried while untangling my hair because my arm was killing me my boyfriend had to take over & even he had a rough time it made my hair become weird even more damaged. Than this smoothie makes my hair beyond itchy & it becomes hard & oily. It makes you hair smell funny. I had to wash my hair during midnight I couldn't sleep well because my scalp was so itchy from the shea moisture smoothie I couldn't stop itching. I'll stick to my Tressemme & Suave. They're cheap but they both work some wonders for their price.
24,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,"Love this product! The smell is a heavenly coconut, and it does wonders for moisturizing dry hair. The product is thick enough that it doesn't feel like it all dries up after an hour, so it ensures all day moisture and shine. Of course it still has that slight greasy texture to it and will definitely leave a residue on fabrics. It's a little on the heavier side, but if used sparingly it shouldn't weigh your hair down much."

I did think it was strange that it was only $7 but thought maybe they lowered prices to compete since there are so many other brands out there now. But NOPE! That's not why.As soon as I opened it, I noticed it looked different, then it felt different on my fingers. I decided to use it anyway. My hair has now dried and I'm about to wash this out. Not even close to the same results.Did a search and found out they changed the formula back in 2020.Am done with you Shea moisture. Second time you switched out a product I really loved, and the last one damaged my hair before I realized why it was acting up. You also discontinued a third product I loved.Selling the company was the worst move ever. They don't care about black hair.I left 2 stars cause I felt its feeble attempt at moisture. But seriously, I'm done with y'all."
28,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,An okay product.,This product was a little pricey for what it does. I bought it because of an add that I saw for it. I feel like it works as week as some other products that are cheaper. The scent is good but not what I consider fantastic.
29,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Son teams this up with the same brand shampoo & the 2 work great together. The smell of coconut & hibiscus. It also has silk protein & neem oil which have great benefits for curly hair. He applies this on damp hair & lets it sit for a few minutes. This locks his curls & moisturizes his hair. Sometimes he dries it a little or lets it air dry. Either way he has found the product he turns to after a good cleansing. It has no parabens which is means this is a positive product for your hair. The story behind the creation of Shea’s Moisture is very touchy which goes back to 1912. This is a win win using both the shampoo & the smoothie. A quality product at a good price. A 12 ounce jar carries a lot of product & lasts quite awhile. It’s well worth what I play. My picture reflects what the product looks like as well as the story behind the creation of this product which I wanted to share. I definitely recommend!
30,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,EASY APPLICATION,"4/5 because the texture seemed different, I usually buy this on a daily but there was no seal and the consistency was more thick than usual. I would spray the hair with water and add this immediately. Overall it did its job and made my curls fluffy and shiny."
31,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Shea products,I usually pick this up at brick and mortar stores but decided to grab a bigger version because it's way cheaper . Love the scent and the fact it keeps my curls manageable and not weighed down . If I over use it my curls do become hard like a mousse but it doesn't flake and become nasty . Good product
32,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Frizz go away!,Omg! This product is AMAZING. I have the type of hair that is not curly or straight. It is just A frizzy wavy mess. This product is very moisturizing and it keeps my hair so soft. I’m so glad I took the chance with this!
33,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,For the hair that demands,"I have used this product for a little less than a year, however in that time I find it to be top notch. It is a heavy cream, so one must gauge how much to apply for your self and needs The fragrance is that of a natural oil(Shea butter)with coconut mixed in.There have been others who state that L’Oréal changed the formula and marketing toward the straight and Caucasian hair after they purchased the company. There was much uproar over this. Once again, it is a choice.My only complaint is with the packaging. There was one deflated bubble pack in a too large box. The lid was jarred loose and some product leaked out. Fortunately the lid did not come completely off. I find more often than not the Amazon packaging leaves much to be desired."
34,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Most awful smell,"I really wonder if I got a bad batch because this is my first time using and it’s awful.  I never have issues with the way products smell. I don’t have a sensitive nose or mind strong scents. The scent of this is horrific like another person mentioned. I wish I had read what she said before I bought it.I put a little in my hair and I can’t even get the smell out of my hands. It’s everywhere. It’s like a really stale expired candy.Unless you’re going to shampoo your hair right after use, I wouldn’t recommend."
35,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,This product is reasonably priced on Amazon. It works wonders on your natural hair. I will continue recommending for such products to be packaged with a sealant. I want to feel that no one else has been dipping into my product or adding anything to it and then returning it. I don’t get that feeling when I receive a product without sealant. This may be a matter to be take up with the manufacturer of the product. Thanks
36,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Used to be great but now my hair hates it,"I used to love this product and it used to work wonders in my hair when I was in high school. Now my hair hates it and get dry after a day. The scent is great and the price is good for the amount you are getting, but I dont think I can use it anymore. I am still a lover of sheamoisture and will stick to their deep conditioners."
37,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,leaves hair feeling silky,"the only product that gives my hair a silky feel.  My 4c hair just wouldn't absorb moisture at all. it generally feels  coarse no matter the product.  just tried it today and my hair feels moisturized and great. however, if you expect this to curl your 4c hair, that ain't happening. I will use this as a moisturizer.Update...I finally got the Curls in....but it only works when my hair is damp not wet."
38,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for finer curls too,"My hair is a mixture of 3B and some 2B chunks and this makes my hair look AMAZING. Put it into wet, not damp hair. Don't be afraid to use a lot of product. It's fine to air dry or use a diffuser with. Usually, I let my hair air dry for a bit and then when it's closer to damp than sopping I pile it into a bonnet. Then when it's fully dry my curls are p e r f e c t. Literally never look better"
39,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed feelings,"I have wavy hair, dry hair that gets frizzy and I wanted something to tame it and give it a bit of hold. The cream was quite smooth out of the container, and I applied a small amount of it to my towel-dried hair all over and scrunched it to enhance the waves. The smell was overwhelmingly sweet and actually made me feel a bit sick but it may be ok for those who like a super sweet fruity scents. My hair actually dried nice and my waves became soft curls and less frizzy. That lasted around 2 days, around day 3, my hair got sticky, greasy, tangled and matted. I can usually go 3-4 days without washing as I have very dry hair, but with this cream applied, it goes from nice to greasy and horrible very quickly."
40,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair is so fly….,"I don’t know why it took me so long to suck it up and spend the 30 or so dollars to buy this whole line… OMG. I washed my hair after my subscribe and save arrived with the shampoo, conditioner and then used this on my curls in my hair looks nothing short of amazing. It doesn’t make your hair feel like there’s a bunch of product in it and it’s super easy to rub between your hands and either fall along the curls or very lightly scrunch it…No more blowouts for me I am rocking my natural curls and loving it!Also the coconut sent is not overwhelming at all"
41,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Light-weight, smooth",This product is really nice and makes your hair feel healthy and smooth. The formula helps create a nice natural wave to your hair.
42,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for 4c hair twist outs!,The negative reviews are coming from people with straight or non-curly type textures who don’t require oil or moisture. Not sure why they would think this work for them… oh well! It works great for 4c hair types and completely nourishes your hair. The 20oz size is a bonus!
43,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,leaves a horrible film makes hair feel chalky,I followed the instructions and put in wet hair.  I normally do fat curls to make beachy waves and my hair felt horrible.  I had to wash again after it dried I styled first then added a little coating and I like it.  My hair does feel very soft.  I wouldn't advise putting it in if you do any kind of styling.  after styling is fine.  Smells awesome.
44,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,An OG Staple Hair Product,"This is my favorite curl cream, it smells so good and is very moisturizing. I have very thick high density hair, with curls and coils, a mix of curl patterns. I also do layer a gel after applying this product, my hair doesn't get crunchy though, it remains soft and I truly believe it's because of the moisture of this cream. It's nice and thick as well. The value of this particular one is excellent too, natural hair care can get expensive and this has always been an affordable product but to get this amount for the price is just *chefs kiss** I'm not heavy handed with product application, but I'm definitely not shy either, I use enough product for my hair to be thoroughly covered so the value is everything. My hair is low porosity and I style it in wash n go's, but this cream certainly can be used for braid outs or twist outs also. I will repurchase."
45,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best for coarse curly hair,"Okay so I have wavy hair and this is most definitely way too heavy for my hair type, but it works! If you have coarse hair, particularly very curly coarse hair, this might be a godsend! I have to use a tiny amount and fluff my hair up with texture sprays when I use it, but it does moisturize my hair extremely well. I will say that sectioning your hair out first and then combing it through with your fingers seems to work best for me!"
46,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,NEW FAVORITE CURL CREAM,Have VERY curly Caucasian hair that had been dyed. This cream is so moisturizing and helps define my curls without leaving them crunchy. I have used many professional brands and this competes with those. Not only is it amazing quality but a little goes a long way so you’re not buying new jars every other week. Use it every day and it’s still over half full after a month. Oh and it smells amazing.
47,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silky hair,"I just took the plunge and tried this because of my good experience with other Shea (Black Caster oil) Moisture products. This one is quickly becoming my favorite. I like the lighter aroma and the silky feel, and the fact that just a small amount goes a long way. My hair is 3c,4a-or-4b or 4c ( mixed textures). I frequently twist out and wash & go, so this product works for both.My hair loves this!Get it. I am so glad I did!"
48,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not meant for thinner hair,"My hair has been thinning as of late, and this stuff is not meant for thin hair.I have 2b wavy hair but because it’s thinning, this product is too heavy for me and it actually weights my hair down. I’m better off just using a leave in conditioner and a gel."
49,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use TOO MUCH.,"Really, you'll be happier if you use 1/4 of what you think you will need. Then, comb it and comb it and comb it through. Spend more time massaging it throughout your hair and you think is reasonable. Then, let it dry and enjoy thicker curlier hair. To refresh, simply add a little water to your hair and restyle."
50,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product....not great packaging,"BEWARE...this product is shipped without being sealed so if the cover comes off in shipment, you'll have a real mess on your hands. I ordered the first one and when it came unsealed and had leaked, I ordered another one. The product itself lives up to the manufacture's description and those who have given a great review of the product. It will leave your curls soft and manageable. The packaging is the problem."
51,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Product arrived opened and with no safety seal,This product arrived opened and without any plastic or safety seal to ensure that this was an unused item. It did not look new. I will be returning this item and I hope that the seller reads this and does not give this item to someone else. The scent is okay. I don't like too much scent in my hair products and this scent was tolerable.
52,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Jar not sealed,"This jar was not sealed; therefore, I'm slightly concerned that someone may have used some of it before it was delivered to me. The box was taped, but the lid on the jar was not tight, and it didn't have the seal under the lid. Maybe Shea Moisture doesn't seal them the way they used to."
53,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,What am I supposed to do with this?,"The bottle was open in transit and leaked all over the box. A complete mess! When I went to see about getting a replacement or refund, it wants me to return the messy bottle before I can get a replacement or be charged a second time!I am not cleaning this mess just to return the jar!! Absolutely unexceptable! There should be a solution to this problem by now, seeing as I am not the only one to have had this issue. I want my money back!"
54,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing for my hair,"At first, the scent was a little strong but after a couple of uses I adapted to it. I apply it to damp/soaking hair and do the hair plopping method for best results. Once it dries it not crunchy at all and it leave behind a mild hibiscus sent. I've been using this product for well over a 2 years and I have not found anything better. I can use this on its own or with a soft gel to had more hold but it works fine on its own."
55,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing but use caution,"I like this product, but you have to be very careful to use the smallest amount required or it really weighs down your hair and makes it feel kinda sticky. That said it smells absolutely amazing. I usually use it sparingly for touch ups ok my curly and use something else for all over control to avoid that heavy feeling it can cause"
56,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting,"I bought this item in hopes to get my curls back after straightening my hair for so long. I put it in my hair after my shower, my hair was damp. When I woke up the curls were pretty nice, but the texture of my hair felt really weird. Every time I touched my hair it left a residue on my fingers, which I hated. I didn't like the texture of my hair. It took me two showers for the residue to get out. On the other side, my curls looked really nice the following days. I also really love the smell of these products! If you won't mind the texture of you're hair then this could really help your curls. (This was the experience with my hair, it might not be with yours). Also if anyone has any recommendations for other curling products please tell me."
57,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I used this product on my 4b/c hair texture, and it worked well for me. I am new to natural hair and this curl enhancer made it much easier for me. I originally used the product with a denman brush, but the hair style came out poofy and fuzzy. After research I finger coiled my hair instead of using the brush and it came out perfectly. Overall, the product smells great and works well for me. { I also separately purchased and used their hold and shine spray and they worked great together!}"
58,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely amazing for thick, course, curly hair.","I can't believe I waited so long to try this product. I have spent so much money on products trying to tame and control my curls and have never been as happy as I am with this product. After conditioning my hair I use it to twist the curls and allow it to dry, then use my fingers to break up the twists and style. So easy and this works so well using the twist technique. The only wish the scent lasted a little longer because I really like it.I will definitely be purchasing this again!"
59,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value curly hair product,"My first impression was not terrific. I put this in my medium curly hair while wet and it left greasy residue.  I decided to try again though on my dry hair on a day I just wanted to style my hair without wetting it. This product worked great when smoothed through my hair dry, taming my frizz and defining my curls without making them greasy (a little goes a long way!). I took off one star for the scent because it has a sort of artificial smell to it, but it doesn't ruin the product for me. Altogether a great value and will be used by me much in the future especially on frizzy hair days."
60,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same product as before.,I've bought this same hair product from Walmart and it seems to be a bit different as far as the texture of this hair product now so I believe it's not the same . Won't be buying it anymore from Amazon or Walmart if the product seems different from before.
61,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"The product was old. It came all congealed, its supposed to be smooth and easily distributed in your hair. But since it was congealed it small beads throughout my hair so I ended up having to wash it all out and throw the product away. Ive used this product for years and this is the first time ive seen it like this. I'm EXTREMELY s disappointed the seller would send an old product."
62,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves a waxy residue,The sent is nauseating. The product leaves a waxy residue after your hair is dry. It does leave your hair very moisturized. I will keep looking.
63,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Definite Curl Holder!,"This stuff is a miracle it works great, amazing scent! It also smells really good every time I use it, I always get compliments on how good my hair smells. It definitely holds your curls and keeps them from frizzing while very moisturizing. Wet your hair and apply a good amount and rake it through. I suggest using a comb so you can easily separate the curls better for more volume. After doing this DONT TOUCH IT, let the hair dry and still don’t touch it or it will frizz!"
64,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for wash and go,I’ve been using this product on my short thick and curly hair for years and people are always asking me what I use. It defines curls and eliminates frizz. Does not dry hard and keeps hair soft. My husband uses it too. Not the best moisturizer but Shea Moisture has other products for that.
65,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed!,"Do you as a vendor and/or manufacturer believe that this terrible product is what I deserve, as a customer?  This product is horrible.  Cakes up and causes flakes.  Does not leave a sheen or softness to the hair.  I expected better!  This product did not come with a plastic bladder/tamper cover under the lid.  What kind of manufacturer omits such, in this day and social climates?  Just an abysmal, disappointing and pathetic experience with vendor/manufacturer.Having read this, Buy at your own prerogative!"
66,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,I have thick curly frizz hair. I was looking for something that would manage my frizz and not leave my hair feeling nasty. I still had frizz and it left my hair feeling nasty for sure. This was an overall no for me
67,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It really does enhance your curls!,"This was the product that helped me discover I actually had curly hair. I apply it with my hair being really wet (not damp but actually wet) and I section my hair. It is very thick so depending on your type of curl is the amount you should use. If you have a more loose curl you don’t need that much product. I recommend also using any of their Gels, they hold the curls for longer but they don’t make your hair crunchy because there medium hold. Since I discover this product I’ve I stopped looking for any other hair cream it is my one and only go to product. Highly recommend it!"
68,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a meh from me,"Really thick, i prefer the curl style milk because its thinner and cheaper. I am currently transitioning from Heat damaged hair and i am trying diferrent products. I have 3-4a hair, though I don’t know exactly my hair type. But I am only 13 yrs old so I have to economize my money. For its price and quantity it brings I dont really like but I do recommend it. I pair it with a gel and my hair looks good. Love the smell tho. It is overhyped though, i have mixed feelings about this product."
69,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT the same!!!,"This is a completely different product than what it has been for the past several years!! If you've been using this, beware that it isn't even remotely close to the same!! It now has a very noticeable and opposite effect. Waste of money!!"
70,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,my hair fell out,"I bought this product and two others, shea moisture black castor oil treatment masque for dry hair and shea moisture strengthen shampoo, used these products for month and my hair literally started to fall out. I discontinued these products and brought another line of products, the maui hair line products and my hair has stopped falling out and doing much better."
71,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,More than expected!,I got so much more in this jar than from any local grocery store or hair supply store for the same cost. I love this product. It mixes well with other gels & does not leave any white residue. It leaves the hair soft with a nice sheen. Smells good too.
72,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy and heavy feeling,Very disappointed in this product.  It is very heavy and greasy...not for fine Caucasian hair.  It did not even make more curls.
73,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap,This feels like it dries my hair out. Maybe Shea Moisture isn’t for me. I really wanted to try it because it was highly recommended and it’s definitely affordable but I guess I’ll have to shed the extra few bucks on other better quality brands because this feels like it was worth about the 8 bucks I paid for it.
74,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Must-Have for Curls,"Finally! After 2 decades of straightening my hair with a flat iron, I decided to embrace my curls (3B). I tried many curl conditioners, but it was still too drying. Seeing all the rave reviews, I am glad I gave it a try! Truly moisturizing with shine. I use this with Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus and you got a winner. The scent is heavenly. Will never use any other product!"
75,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too heavy and thick,"This is very heavy and thick, it leaves my hair oily and wet looking. It isn’t even that great of a moisturizer as hair is still dry feeling with oil film. It also does nothing to enhance curls. I feel I will end up using this as a pre-shower moisturizer rather than a leave in. Positive is that it smells nice..."
76,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful soft curls! New favorite product!,I have naturally curly hair and have a hard time finding products that actually tame frizz like they claim or make hair too crunchy. This Shea cream made my hair look silky beautiful and the curls felt smooth like satin. I love this! It’s my new favorite product.
77,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy quick and versatile,"I like it a lot. It is versatile quick,  and easy to use. Can be applied on wet or dry hair. Helps with frizz and with making waves in my wavy/curly hair look more put together neater shinier and wavier. I don't use too much of it at a time.  Less is more.  It's the only product I use on my hair to style it."
78,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a exact product I’d use on my hair,"This product was good overall, I was all right with the silkyness and the scent. But after I had put it throughout my hair and after it had dryed, my hair was very dry. I didn’t put too much or too little even though it seemed that way because I had to add so much to my hair to get it moisturize that only half of the jar was left. To be honest it could have been my type of hair. Like that my type of hair wasn’t meant for that product but I did not have the best experience with SheaMoisture Smoothie curl enchanting"
79,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Must-Have,"Curly hair holy grail right here. Moisturizing, defining, and it lasts. The only problem I have with it is that the scent it just not for me. I can totally see how others like it, though (It's sweet and coconutty but I don't like the smell of coconut). I noticed the best results when I used it right after I washed my hair when it was still very damp."
80,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,I'm so happy they have this size. I love this product. The smell is amazing and it does the job just right. Be generous when applying. My curls look amazing once it drys.
81,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I saw this product was recommended by Bretman Rock and I’ve been looking for a good hair product for my curly hair for a while so I decided to try it. I immediately threw out every other hair product I owned after using this because it’s amazing. This and their anti-frizz mousse is what I use now.
82,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,"Creates nice curls, but is drying. My hair needs moisture, but I found that if a add hair serum into a dollop of this product, it helps. Has a nice smell. Would not purchase again."

86,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,"Amazing product. The scent can be a bit strong so beware if you don’t like the sweet smell of coconut. But the product works just like the description says. It moisturizes and softens my hair. I’m a guy, I have a perm and it does a great job of eliminating the frizz and all around softening my hair. It’s also a very large amount of product. I’m on my second perm, and I haven’t even gotten through half of the product. This will last (depending on length of hair)"

It definitely does not leave my hair super smooth, but rather leaves it a little bit filmy, but I do like how it looks.

It left my hair feeling crusty and sticky and gross, even when I didn't use all that much. I ended up having to rinse it all out later that day because it felt so yucky. Also, the smell is sickly sweet and not pleasant at all."
132,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,If you have very thick hair this is perfect. On thin hair it will curl it but it also will weigh it down. This is very thick!

It keeps my hair soft, it's smells amazing, and I don't think there's anything better out there. If you're unsure still, buy one of their 3 oz. bottles before committing to the larger one. It's easier on the wallet and if you hate it, give it away -- but I don't think you will."

249,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 10 REVIEWER,"This Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie w/ silk protein and neem oil is actually a LEAVE IN treatment, not rinse out. This is according to the directions on the container. The product description on this Amazon web page says differently. Here is the exact working on my container:""Section hair and apply product sparingly to damp or dry hair. Do not rinse out. Style hair as desired. For best results, use as a styling cream for twist-outs, braids and wash-and-go styles. ""I assume a change at some point. So I just wanted to clarify what you will be getting in terms of directions.It is a lovely product. I imagine it is extra great for those with tighter curl patterns. It seems to both moisturize and provide a little hold. Calms frizz. I happen to have a mix of textures. Some straight, some wavy, some cork screws. I have long nearly waist length hair, so much of the curl is pulled out from weight. Any shorter bits curl rather tightly. I would include pics, but at this time the photo loader isn't appearing on my screen. I will keep checking back as I did take pics of the bottle as well as my hair. EDIT: came back to add pictures. Sorry, the cap to my bottle was broken and I keep contents in with plastic wrap and a rubber band.It is a 12 ounce container, and since a little goes a long way, this should last awhile. I have used it on wet hair, and I have used it on dry. My hair is a little crunchy once it dries on dry hair, haven't felt that when it has been applied to wet. It is a good (for me)  SCRUNCH & PLOP product. After shampoo & conditioner, I get out of shower and lightly towel dry hair (either with towel or cotton t-shirt). I bend over to let my hair hang upside down, I emulsify a bit between both hands then scrunch it in. Scrunch scrunch, scrunch some more. Then between the pre towel drying and the scrunch action, my hair is semi dry. I then plop it into a t-shirt for a bit to help hold the scrunch. OR, if I was one to use a hair dryer, I would then proceed with that. Keep scrunching. It doesn't dry crunchy, so not much more is needed.  I would consider a light hold gel on top to continue to the scrunch and to help it hold even further.. but all that added stuff is up to you. It is totally nice on its own- whether for super curly hair, or even as a nice smoother for straight to lightly wavy. Run a little over your hair to keep fly aways in place and to help control frizziness from humidity.I've always had good luck with Shea Moisture products. Quality formulas at a budget friendly price. I would recommend this. I think it is versatile enough to be worth a try."

471,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My hair is a mix of 2C waves and 3A curls. I have a LOT of hair. And I have yet to find an all-in-one product that will shape and define my curls, add moisture without too much grease and prevent frizz. For me, this product was a great all-over first step, but it didn’t accomplish everything on my list.On wash day, I sectioned off my hair (just top and bottom) and applied this product. Then I scrunched to work it in and start to define curls. Diffused until my hair was about half dry, just to see how it was looking. Result was a bit puffier than I would like, and curls weren’t especially well-defined. So I added a small amount of my favorite standby curl definition product, particularly near the ends, and a little bit of an all-over texturizing cream that works really well for me on about the bottom half. Then I diffused it until it was all the way dry.Some observations:* The top of my head, which ONLY had this product applied on it, definitely started off greasier than I would normally like it to be right after a wash. So I think maybe that any product that promises “moisture” like this one perhaps just isn’t well suited to being applied so close to the crown of my head.* The rest of my hair looks good, but it is definitely “wetter” looking than normal.* My hair is touchably soft. Absolutely no crispiness at all. Big thumbs up there.* This product smells AMAZING. Legit like dessert.* A little bit goes a long way. I have a ton of hair and I used maybe the equivalent of three quarter-sized dollops to coat all of it. The jar this comes in is HUGE, so this will last a very long time.I’ve tried a LOT of curl creams, from all over the brand and price spectrum. This product is a solid offering in the curl cream category, without a doubt. And given its price and size, it’s a fantastic value.Overall, I’m really happy with my results after using this product. For me, it wasn’t the be-all, end-all solution I’ve been searching for, but that’s OK. I have some proven standby products that are best used sparingly, anyway, and this product is a great base to start from. Can’t win them all, but this come pretty close!"
472,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First: This product smells wonderful! It smells like vanilla and pineapple. My husband, who cares little about these things, smelled it and said, “I want to eat some!” So, keep an open container away from children!Second: It says on the container to apply to dry or damp hair and leave it. I did that. My wavy mousy brown hair then looked like it needed a wash very badly. It did not “enhance” my waves or make them more curly like similarly named products that I use to good effect.Third: I got online and saw that it says here to apply to wet hair after shampooing, leave on for three minutes and rinse. Hmm. SheaMoisture, you’ve confused me! Since my hair looked pretty awful, followed these directions. It did a beautiful job as a conditioner; left my hair shiny and soft. Did nothing to “enhance curls,” but I can’t knock it for what it did do.The thing is, it doesn’t do as advertised, but I’m using this instead of my conditioner until I use up the container. Then I might try another of their products for the scent alone.Do I recommend it? If you don’t have a good conditioner and you like the smell of pineapple."
473,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,No longer think and mositerzing as it once was. Formula change.,Shea Moisture sold out! This new formulation is nothing like the orginal.  It thinner and runny. The old formula was so thick that you could hold the container upside down and nothing would fall out.  Now it's a runny soupy meal that's no as heavely moisturizing as it once was. I knew the company jumped shipped when I saw people with non type 4 or 3 hair using it. The older formulation was much too heavy for thinner non kinky curly hair textures.  Shea moisture tried being all inclusive and left out the people that got them to where they are. Also the company is no longer black owned and now uses cheaper ingredients since it's become a corporate entity.  I haven't bought any shea moisture products in years since they sold out their main customer base.

I have regularly somewhat curly hair, but when I don’t use a curly hair product, it is super flat. This product did wonders to my hair!! For one, look at those curls in that photo! And look how cute that curl is on the side. I was shocked! The product itself smells AMAZING. It’s like a coconut and tropical fruit mix. I’m obsessed! The bottle has sooo much product so I don’t think I’ll ever run out (which I’m not complaining!) I put this in my ends and it didn’t feel like it was weighing down my hair! It made my hair feel soft and smooth!"

476,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 50 REVIEWER,"This smoothie is a good alternative to gel for getting juicy, defined curls. The texture is similar to a deep conditioner. It has a coconut-heavy fragrance. You don't need to use much for this to work. I've found that it's better to apply it to damp hair vs wet. This is a great product for braid-outs and twist-outs. I  highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
477,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have very thin, but SUPER dry wavy hair and have been still looking for a great product that will help foster that natural curl. I especially have trouble getting my waves to continue at the root. I have heard of this product in curly girl groups and was excited to try it, although the consensus seems to be that this brand is ""too heavy"" for wavies and thin hair. I didn't have that experience at all. I know personally my hair is extremely dry - I only need to wash once or twice a week and have never had greasy hair in my life. When applying, I trusted my gut and used quite a bit of this product rather than using it sparsely, knowing my hair loves moisture.The results were fantastic. As my hair is actually quite fine and thin, I went for volume and curl formation versus definition and clumping in my wash/dry routine and diffused until completely dry.  I could REALLY tell a difference in the formation of my curls - my hair was more curlier than normal and much more curls at the root. I've used other curl creams and haven't seen this type of results before. The product has no cast or crunchiness - it really makes for soft curls. Mine held great even next-day, but my hair holds pretty well anyway. Others might need a gel or mousse to go with it. Next time I want to try a gel with it so I can see if I get a bit more definition. The product smells great and has a lot of slip. It's really a great product and I do think it lives up to the ""curl enhancing"" part of the name."
478,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Both my young daughter and I have really long, waist length curly hair so I'm always on the lookout for new curly girl products for us. SheaMoisture is a recognizable, good brand that always offers great products. This was no exception. There's a ton of product that comes in the large tub. Its a fairly thick cream formula that is kind of hard to scoop out with nails on (lol) but not hard to apply. I get a little on my palm and rub my hands together before applying it to slightly moistened hair, section by section. It has a light scent that reminds me of the tropics. Coconut, fruity and floral.Once in the hair and dried, it enhances and preserves our natural curl patterns. I don't need to do any manual twirling or use any curling tools to ""make"" the curls happen. The hair and curls are bouncy, flexible, tamed with little to no frizz, and not crunchy at all. My daughter's preschool teacher is always saying how pretty her hair is and even stopped me one morning to complement me and tell me how she and her assistant teacher admire our hair.I'm very happy with the performance of this product, and highly recommend it"
479,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As others have mentioned, there is some inconsistency with regard to using this product- the product jar says to leave the conditioner in and the product page says to rinse. I think this SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie can be used either way, depending on your hair type. Those with dry hair or those with tighter curls will probably like this better as a leave-in to moisturize and define curls vs those with fine/thin hair that tends to get oily may prefer to rinse it out. I fall into the latter camp. When used in the shower and after rinsing, this lovely smelling conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and helps to reduce the frizzy flyaways from my long wavy hair."
480,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 500 REVIEWER,"There are many good things about this cream, but it has an over-powering negative. This cream has a very strong scent. A powerful sweet vanilla scent.  I did not like the scent or the strength of the aroma. I like vanilla scent in general; it was this version of the scent that got to me.On the positive side, I was surprised that the tub was bigger than I expected. It worked well, giving my curls more definition without making them stiff or sticky.However, the scent was a deal-breaker; after putting it on, I had to wash my hair in a couple of hours to get rid of the scent.Ali Julia review"
481,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been wanting to try this product for some time, but I wasn't sure it would be right for my curls. I have curly course, dry, frizzy hair, but it's not super thick, so I was worried this would be too much for my hair and would weigh it down.The first time I used it, I used too much, and it did leave a bit of a yucky feel to my hair, but with just the right amount, it's awesome. So, you just have to adjust according to your hair.I do think this is a great product for curly heads (and maybe just for frizzy heads, too). :)  Oh, and the scent is so nice! Sometimes I open the jar just to take a whiff."

Think classic ""Jew Fro"". I have been growing my hair out since February (9+ months), and it tends to get dry and crispy if I go to long without deep conditioning. Lately I have been trying all sorts of regimens to keep my hair nourished, healthy, and happy. I've tried at least a dozen products, and this shea moisture leave-in product blows everything else clean out of the water. My curls are naturally springy and well formed without that crunchy gel feeling, my hair is dark and shiny, and it smells really nice. No oily residue on my pillow or other surfaces my hair comes into contact with, and I don't have to use a ton, even though my hair does tend to drink up product. Better yet, this is an industrial sized vat that should last me for months to come. I think I've found my go-to long term curl care product! Highly recommended!"
483,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This 12 oz tub of curl enhancing smoothie is going to last so long!  I love this brand for both their products and their values.This smells like a tropical beach vacation. The coconut really comes through but not in an offputting or artificial way.  The cream is like a thick lotion and it does not take much at all.  In fact, I made the mistake of using too much one time and it really looked bad so just start with small amounts and slowly add more if needed.This can be applied to damp or dry hair, I usually put it in after I’ve washed and towel dried my hair.  It offers a lot of shine and enhances my natural curls.  It’s also done a great job at taMing my frizz!"

Such rave reviews, but sure, if you like crispy, greasy-looking hair that looks like you never left the 80s behind… This stuff is terribly expensive, but, I thought I should use a product specifically designed for enhancing curls, after years of just diluting my conditioner and using that as a leave-in, and using Carol’s Daughter Mimosa Hair Honey. With this horrific “smoothie,” my hair was dry as the Sahara no matter how much product I put in, and it was sticky!  It got so horribly tangled and glued together with this junk.  I am used to my hair looking shiny and healthy, and feeling soft to the touch. I wish I could return this smoothie junk and get my money back.  Back to my old combo, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!"

I've experimented with multiple ways of using this, and I don't know why, but it just doesn't work at all for my coarse, thick, dry, damaged, curly/wurly hair.I'm so disappointed that this hasn't worked at all for me, but for whatever reason, it's just horrible for my hair."

It works wonders on our daughter's hair, and we love how well it works on our daughter's type 2c hair. It is a bit on the heavier side for her hair type, but if we use it sparingly, it does a great job! The container is huge and it will last us a really love time, so I would say this would be great for a family, frankly. The scent is nice - not too heavy, but it does have a good amount of scent via fragrance, which means we have no clue what it is... I don't love that it is not the cleanest ingredient listing, but not too bad overall. This works really well for us, and I am happy."

I have found Shea Moisture products to be so effective at cutting the frizz and making my hair moisturized. I noticed a clear, recognizable difference, even after the first day of using the product.It smells great, and it applies easily to my damp hair. It leaves my hair smelling good, too, but it's not overwhelming and it does fade over time. The smoothie also doesn't weigh down my hair or leave it feeling sticky or clumpy like other products I've used. It's great!It's also a nice big bottle, and I love the screw on lid. I am less likely to spill it. It's a good value, too!Overall, I can't be happier with the way this product shapes, defines, and tames my curls. Shea Moisture is a new staple for me because of how great it makes my hair look. I highly recommend it!"

It's perfect for my thick, wavy long hair, and keeps all of those little frizzy flyaway hairs in check so that I look smooth and professional all day.When I saw that there was a thicker smoothie product in the same line as my curl enhancing milk, I definitely wanted to try it. This is just like the curl enhancing milk and how it works, only it is a little bit thicker. I don't know why, but some days I just have a sense that my hair is needing a little bit of extra care, maybe because I was in the sun and wind too much the day before or maybe I just rinsed my conditioner out to thoroughly, but on those days I use this product instead of the milk and it does the same excellent job of keeping my braid in check and keeping any of the hair that popped out of my braid looking curly and sleek rather than like a frizzy mess.I also love how this stuff smells. It smells just like my curl enhancing milk, a beautiful fragrance of coconuts with just a hint of gentle tropical floral, but really primarily I small coconuts. Definitely recommend this product as well as the curl enhancing milk."
491,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It has a pretty good thickness for working with natural hair and trying to form curls or twists. I can't say that I'm totally in love with it because I feel like it could work a bit better in terms of softening. Then too, it could just be my hair texture but this wasn't the best product for me. However, when using it on others, it turned out to work well. It smells good and doesn't leave a film or build up that makes your scalp itch. I just say proceed with caution. If you're a product junkie, this will probably end up in your supply anyway."
492,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The packaging is different from what's pictured. I figured they'd updated the look but I got the same old packaging they've had for years. The product itself is the same as I remember. I use it on my daughter's type 4b hair. Anything else would be too costly on her long, thick hair at this point. It moisturizes well, although it's not the best for curl definition, at least not for type 4 hair. Looser hairtypes (including non-black types) may get better definition. For us it just provides moisture, which I expected, so I can't be disappointed."
493,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s ok does what it’s supposed too,I did not buy this on here but I figured an honest review would help somebody else. This product is very thick but smells amazing. I’ve used it a few times now and I have to say it really makes my curls come out to play. I have 2b-2c thick curly hair. I do not follow the CGM because I don’t keep my hair curly during the winter just summer while it’s humid and my hair is colored. Even so this still helps being out my curl clumps. The only thing I hate about it is that it doesn’t help my frizz what so ever. I use all salon approved shampoos and conditioners because I have colored hair. Other then that it really help my curls show.
494,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shea Moisture will always be a favorite of mine,"Call me crazy, but I've been using this as like a pre-shower conditioner for my hair after it's been straightened. I love love love how it makes my hair feel and you can definitely see/feel a difference in my hair texture after I am done washing. I makes detangling super easy as well! I usually apply this product to sections of my hair then let it sit for around 10 minutes before rinsing then washing. I have absolutely no complaints and will continue to use!"
495,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I Don't understand the hype,"I was excited to try this product; however, I was VERY disappointed.  It smelled wonderful but that is it.  It did not define my curls.  It caused my hair to frizz.  It also left white flecks in my hair that I had to pick out.  Further, as promised, it did not make my hair shine ornate it feel moisturized.  My hair felt dry after I applied it.  The kicker is that it caused my scalp to burn.  I had to immediately wash it out of my hair.  I have used other Shea Butter products and I have never had one of them cause my scalp to burn.  I won't be using this product again and I don't recommend it."
496,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have naturally curly hair, and styling it can be a total pain. I struggle with frizziness and pieces of straight hair (from sleeping on the curls, etc.) mixed in with the curls. This curl enhancing smoothie has been great because it does seem to cut the frizz and it really enhances my curls. Even after the first use, I noticed that my curls were much more defined, and they remained that way throughout the day. What great results!The smoothie smells delicious - like a sweet fruit smoothie. The consistency makes it easy to spread on my hair, and only a little is needed for good results (and I have long hair!). I have used several other Shea Moisture products over the years, and they have all been of the same high-quality. I highly recommend them!"
497,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,I have two boys with really curly hair that gets a little wild. Their hair needs product to tame their curls but I hate when the product makes their hair sticky and crunchy. This Shea Moisture is natural so I feel good about using it and it smells insanely good - like tropical goodness and not over powering. It keeps their curls tight but soft and bouncy at the same time - adding just the right amount of hold and did I say- smells so good!!!
498,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My hair is pretty thick and I have natural waves but I have to use product to really get them to form and stand out. Otherwise I just have frizzy hair. I used this on damp hair and it worked well to bring back the curls a day after my last washing. They don't feel crunchy at all but I can tell there is product on my hair. I'll need to experiment to get the right amount, but it does feel like it moisturizes my hair and it feels more like a conditioner going on my hair rather than a gel, which I like. No one wants crunchy hair. The smell is light and pleasant and the jar is big so it will last me a long time."
499,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great scent and texture. Well made by reputable company. This product is a staple item in my daughters hair care routine. She has 3C to 4A curls . This products works very well to moisturize and soften her curls. She usually applies it to detangled hair to help it form looser curls as a leave in conditioner. She will also sometimes apply before going to bed then wash out in the morning  for softer controlled curls.
500,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie,"As other reviewers have mentioned the Amazon product page tells you to leave the SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie in for three minutes after shampooing then rinse out. The jar instructions say this is a leave-in product. I have fine hair, and I have always found leave-in products weigh my hair down, so I decided to use this as a conditioner, rinsing it out after three minutes. Also I think the scent would be over-whelming if you don’t rinse it out.It left my hair very soft with much more volume.  This might work as a leave-in for very heavy or ethnic type hair but I think for average hair it would be much too heavy."
501,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this line and this product is no exception.  The scent is a little strong for my tastes but not so strong that I cant (or wont) use it.  It helps cut down on the frizz and helps keep my hair from drying out.  My curls are so much more defined with this.  I do need to add a sealing type product on top to keep the curls but this acts as my moisturizing layer.  Best of all, it has no silicones.  It is a little expensive at the current price of $17, but a little goes a long way so the cost is worth it in the long run in my opinion."
502,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Defines curls really well!,"I got this for my toddler’s hair and it works so well! It has a fruity coconut smells which I like better than pure coconut scents. The cream itself is very thick and creamy. It has somewhat of a sticky texture, so I used less product than I usually use in her hair. Her curls are so defined after using it, and the curls stay like that all day."
503,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the scent, and unlike another reviewer that said it was over-powering, I did not find that it lasts long. It does calm down the frizzies which I get around my ears for some reason, and I don't like them sticking out of my ball cap, haha. It is a bit heavy and I don't find that it enhances curl much, which in my case is good. I have shoulder length hair and after washing it gets very curly. I've never had curly hair before, so that's perplexing. I usually use a flat iron for a smoother look. This is OK, but I think  I've used better for my tastes."

It leaves our hair soft and silky and it smells so good! We live in the south where heat and humidity can be an issue year round, but it's no longer an issue with this curl enhancing smoothie."
505,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Substantial Smoothing Cream With a Great Fragrance,"I really like this curl smoothing cream. It's got a light and very lovely, slight sweet fragrance and does NOT smell like Neem oil at all. Because of all the ingredients, it is a fairly substantial and thick cream, so a little bit goes a long way.I've been using natural products on my very curly hair, and the reduction of chemicals has really made the texture better. Very pleased with this natural product."
506,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Great Moisturizes Better,"Pineapples and vanilla - that is what this smells like. It is a pleasant scent, but strong so if you are sensitive to smell, please be aware.My hair is porous 3B/C hair and my hair just loves this stuff. The other cream leave-in I use is Cantu, but I like this so much more than that.It is weightless in my hair, makes it smell good, moisturizes like crazy and absorbs well so it doesn't lay on my hair like oils do.I've tried many products in this line and all have worked well, but I think this is my favorite."
507,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have short to medium curly hair and applied a little bit of this cream to my damp locks. After working this through, I let my hair air dry. This conditioned without weighing down my curls. It also tamed the frizz. The fragrance is wonderful. The cream is thick. Of course, this does make my hair look darker than normal as a result of putting a product in my hair.  The current price of $17.99 is competitive but some local stores do carry this for a lesser price."
508,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really heavy-duty conditioner.  If you have thin, fine hair... run like the wind. If you have thick, curly, coarse or just thick hair that needs a strong conditioner, you should like this product!  It smells great and made my hair so soft.  It was not too heavy at all, but can see that it could be too heavy for people with thin, fine hair.  If you have thick hair - you'll love it! ~Amy"

Mixed in a cocktail though with Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard, it works MARVELOUSLY! Used about 1/2 of each, mix well before applying. Applied to DRIPPING WET hair using the praying hands method.My hair type: Low porosity, 2C, medium-coarse, long"
510,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing!,I didn’t expect much but this is very moisturizing! It’s not thick it spreads very easily in your hand so you can apply a small amount on a lot of your hair. I didn’t see much curling occurring when i first used it. I watched a YouTube tutorial on doing a sleek bun and a curling product similar was used so i found this to be a perfect product for moisturizing my hair and combining with gels for a sleek but curly hairstyle. I have kinky curly type 4 hair.
511,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have very curly hair that’s just past my shoulders. I love using this as a deep conditioner once a week and can get 4-5 applications when generously used. I wash my hair and apply a nice amount, quickly comb though and put my heated head wrap on, leaving it over night sometimes. Then, cool rinse in the morning and my hair is very manageable. I’ve used several of the SheaMoisture products and have had great success without spending a ton of money. The only thing is the scent, I like the scent but it’s a tad strong for me."
512,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Type 3b Hair,I'm currently growing out a pixie cut and transitioning to natural hair after straightening my hair everyday for over 10 years. I'm learning which products are good for my curly hair to keep them looking good and shiny without the dry crunchiness that some products cause. I really like this product because a little goes a long way. I use a small amount of product and comb through my hair before stying and letting it air dry. I love the sweet smell of this product and love how great it makes my hair smell.

514,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff smells so yummy and works great. I have curly hair and follow the curl girl routine, and this works wonderfully as a cream after I shower. I apply the product when my hair is damp, and it’s helped to define the curl and reduce frizz without leaving my hair greasy. It does say this can be applied to dry hair also, but I haven’t tried that. It’s fairly thick and I feel like greasiness would ensue if applied on dry hair."
515,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Me fascina,"Es la primera vez que usé este producto y me gustó mucho,  me deja el pelo suave, sedoso, brillante, me ayuda a controlar el Freeze las puntas me dejaron impresionada porque normalmente después del cepillado siempre tocaba plancharlas y esta vez divinas desde el principio. Lo seguiré usamdo, Creo que será el nuevo mejor amigo de mi cabello."
516,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for curly hair,The smell sometimes might take some getting used to as it is an overly fruity aroma. Leaves hair feeling soft and not too gunky. Does well with my curls. I'd recommend using a mousse for best results. One of the better leave-in conditioners for my  type of hair that I've had a hard time finding.
517,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes curly hair look yummy,Smells amazing but a bit strong. This product is definitely CURLY HAIR APPROVED! Wont dry out your hair and or cast. Curls look amazing especially when applying (generously if hair is more curly)on soak and wet hair then letting it air dry or defusing. I find the price to be cheaper at Walmart. Out of their line of products this is definitely a must have.
518,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,Ok I was skeptical about this but it truly is a great product for my hair. I used it today when I received it yesterday and I must say I truly am very pleased with the outcome. I have natural curls that are tight curls and everything that I have tried dried up within an hour of use and I would have to reapply or wear a hat. I can say that I have had a complete day of moisture in my hair. I am truly impressed and will keep this in my supply of hair supplies.
519,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly blonde hair too,"I get it at my local Sallys- it's a buck or two cheaper than on here. I love this stuff. I have mid back length, white blonde (naturally) 2c/3a hair. Kinda a weird hair type, and it's almost impossible to get a product that makes it manageable, but this stuff works for it. I can put half an average size bottle of conditioner in my hair, and it still wouldn't be soft. This helps get rid of a lot of the tangles and makes it touchable. How i use it, it actually dampens my curls a lil most of the time initially, but they pop back up as soon as it dries."
520,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,good for curls,"It really does enhance your curls. For some reason, my hair does not keep moisture. After a couple of hours, my hair feels dry again. It smells really good. The texture of the product is really thick. I thought that due to it being thick it will moisturize my hair really good. I'll try it with water to see if that is any better for me."

523,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like Vomit!,This product has made my hair feel more dry than any cheap store product has ever. My curls are usually tight and bouncy and now they are loose and hard. AND oh my God the smell this stuff smells like Vomit it is nauseating i didn't notice it on day 1 but I woke up this morning to use it and I cant get the smell off my hands and I had to wash it out of my hair because the smell would not dissipate. I wish I had seen the comments saying they had changed the formula before buying.
524,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the Hype,"Oh my goodness, I can’t say enough good things about this. I avoided it for a long time because I have low porosity hair and I was afraid it would be too much protein. I finally tried the small version when I ran out of my DevaCurl cream and I am never going to use anything else. My curls have never looked better - I didn’t even realize my curls could be this defined. The smell is -very- strong, and if you have low porosity hair, you may have to start clarifying more often than you’re accustomed to, but it’s so worth it."

560,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It gives you curls when you don't have any.,"This is so far the only product that gives me curls without frizz. All my life I needed to blow dry and flat iron my hair until I saw a video on youtube on this product. I have three months using this product. I used to buy it for $17.99 at a store when I saw it was $10 I brought it right away. I was worried about the reviews on the packaging, but it came in perfect condition.Directions on how I use it:After rising the deep condition, I apply vitamin E oil. Then, I split my hair in sections and apply the smoothie. The last thing I do to it is apply a sculpting gel level 3. However, the smoothie itself should be enough. If I'm going to sleep, I put my hair in twists or braids. The next day I take them off and refresh it.Please note: if you never done curls like me please use a deep condition and sulfate free shampoo and conditioner."
561,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,HORRIBLE Product,"This product is TERRIBLE, it smells like crushed up sweet tarts, very off putting being a grown woman. It feels very sticky, I can’t even brush through my hair once using the product, on top of that it leaves my hair dry and staticky. Maybe my hair is too fine for it, but this was not a good product for me, will be returning"
562,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The smell is AMAZING,"I started using this a few days ago, and let me tell you, the smell is absolutely amazing.  It takes very little to get all of my hair (my hair is midback length and I have a ton of it). My hair feels pretty good, and it does definitely help with frizz."
563,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rich Moisturizing Product,"I used this once and I must admit, it's a great product. My hair is very thick and dries out quickly. I can use this every other day and I have deep rich curls and I can comb it so easily.  I suggest put it in your hair take a steamy shower and see the luscious curls."
564,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but not for fine hair,"I have long fine 2b 2c hair. This product definitely helps enhance curl but weighed down my hair from having any volume. The directions do say to use it sparingly, and I used it extremely sparingly and still had the problem of it weighing down and not having any volume. So the product does what it's suppose to but I would not recommend if you have fine hair."
565,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It really works!!!,I am pleasantly surprised at the overall texture and feel of my hair. 6 stars guys.

I have 3c, high porosity, spiral curly hair and it really defines and softens my curls. Not greasy at all. Product dries nicely and doesn’t leave an ashy white overcast. Does not weigh curls down and makes them soft to the touch. I highly recommend applying to damp hair as it soaks into the hair and sets the curls."

608,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Concerned Teacher, Nanny, DayCare Worker.","I've used this product and is great for tight, dry, thick hair as well as curly dry, unmanageable hair.**The 2nd video is offensive to Moms, Teachers of children, and DayCare Workers.The product is a good one however the manner in which the poor Child is being 'Hosed Down' withit, in order to show complete saturation of its' application is offensive..The Mom (whose nails are perfect) is more concerned about getting her Child's hair detangled and less protective over the possibility of the product getting into the Child's growing Eyes, his sensitive Ears, and over his garments which were innodated with much product.It was heartbreaking to watch the Poor Child try to protect itself! This is the Mom's responsibility to both protect the child and to ensure his hair is entangled.Thank you for listening."
609,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best curl cream,I’ve never seen my hair as beautiful as when I wear this cream

A little goes a tremendously long way. Smells like coconuts. Sometimes my hair falls out but I think it’s due to the perm, but it’s just a bit. Not blaming the product just yet"
611,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps with frizziness,I use this cream on my hair after showering and it has worked wonders on my hair in the mornings since it's not as frizzy as it used to be!

613,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good !,I usually use this when I’m about to apply my clips in with my natural hair it sends so good it’s very soft and easy to apply their price always been expensive in stores so you’re paying pretty much paying the same amount maybe a $1 or $2 off
614,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,SMELLS AMAZING,"Smells great, and helps to define curls! My mom loved it!"
615,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excelente for styling 2C/3A hair. The only issue is, if you have fine thin hair it weighs your hair down and makes it really sticky. I really love the definition this product gives me as well as the hold. A little goes a long way. I find it works well on dry hair and on wet hair. This product smells great and is not too thick or watery. It has a nice consistency, but probably better on thicker hair."
616,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well on damp hair.,Great moisture cream for your hair. It works best on damp hair. Pleasant scent.

618,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Less is More.,"I put it in my hair while it's dry after flat ironing to give it a little shine and moisture.

619,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great smoothness,Nothing
620,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I needed,"This stuff is AMAZING. I have a lot of fine, low-porosity 3B curly hair, and this product is my new favorite when it comes to styling. The texture, to be completely honest, isn’t my favorite because it’s so thick and just feels kind of gross when I’m scooping it out of the container, but boy does my hair ever like it, and that’s enough for me. It leaves my hair extremely moisturized and smooth, and it gives me SUCH GOOD SLIP, so detangling is a breeze. I typically use my Denman brush after applying this smoothie, and it leaves me with the softest, most defined curls ever. It’s not heavy on my hair once it dries, either. (I’ve also used it before doing my hair in a protective braided style, and that turned out super hydrated and healthy-feeling as well.) Highly recommend for anyone with hair like mine—trust me, it’s popular for a reason!!"
621,"SheaMoisture Smoothie Curl Enhancing Cream for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free and Paraben Free 12 oz",Size: 12 Ounce,Verified Purchase,"Extremely sad as the products spilled all over. Out of the 3 tubs i bought, 2 spilled messily which made the unspilled one really greasy as well. Very upset and hope the seller can improve on quality control of product packaging. I ordered more from the same seller after this purchase and in the past as well. Giving this a 4 star as previous ones came in good condition and shipping time was good. Ordered on 3rd April, received on 10th April. But please improve on product protection in future and thank u for the hard work!As for the product itself, it does really well and leaves my curls soft and mangeable. I have 2c-3a hair"
0,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does not add weight to your hair,Love the product. I wash my hair and live it on. My curls looks soft and bouncy.
1,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Game-changer for my crazy hair,"I'm 29 years old and I have struggled my entire life to get my fluffy, curly hair in order. This is the first product I've found that controls the frizz for a whole day, defines the curls nicely, and does not leave any sort of detectable residue. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars: Its rating on EWG.org/skindeep is a 3, which means it has some health concerns - specifically, it has high levels of allergens and potential irritants. But I haven't had any sort of allergic reaction to it, personally."
2,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me.,"I did not care for this product. It was so thick, like a paste. I have  fairly thick, DRY (my hairdresser says I have so much hair lol) hair, medium to fine strands and I really don’t feel like it blended well at all. It made my hair feel heavy and weighed down, not flowing or smooth at all.I don’t use a lot of product or styling tools so my hair is in good shape, although I struggle with parched strands. Finishing oils blended with a carrier moisturizing styling product is a must. My go to has been Sebastian Twisted and Olaples 6 & 7.Not saying this isn’t for you, just wasn’t for me!"
3,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible product. Not as advertised.,"If I could give it a lower than 1 star review, I would. This is not as advertised. It’s consistency is like that of glue. It’s scent is overwhelming and obnoxious. It starts drying up as you apply it. The worst part is that, as it dries during application, it pulls hairs out worse than an aggressive brushing! Don’t buy it. Period. End of story."
4,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,moisturizing,I like that the ingredients are fairly clean. I live in an arid climate and this hair smoothie helps with static fly-away hair and maintaining some curl.
5,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,just natural spiral curls and I LOVE this brand and I LOVE this product,"I have naturally curly hair, not ethnic hair, just natural spiral curls and I LOVE this brand and I LOVE this product!! Helps smooth my curls, defines them and does not feel sticky or greasy."
6,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells nice, very heavy",This is a product that was made for thicker/curlier hair but was not amazing for me. It smells wonderful and if I use a very tiny amount (smaller than pea sized as I have short hair) I get great curls but they end up very dry by the end of the day. Using more just dried my hair more.  This line of products have been hit or miss for me. I have a deep conditioner that I love but this one in particular didn't work for me.
7,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!,"I still need to let my hair air dry slowly to get curls since I have super fine hair, but I still haven’t found a better product out there to make my curls defined and stay curly! Once it’s dry, I fluff the curls and split them up a bit, and they are beautiful!"
8,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Gives your hair a natural no mouse/hairspray look,Love this product the softness it leaves on the hair no crunchy or hardness or hair falling out from removing the product.I use it on my wet hair ends  then blow dry and looks like I’ve gone to the salon. The glow it leaves is so remarkable and very lightweight.
9,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't Trust Packaging,"I purchased 2 bottles SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair because I've never had a Shea Moisture product I didn't like. Unfortunately, I'd never purchased this product and gave it a 3-star rating because there was no protective shrink wrapping or foil sealing of the bottles. I really don't like  untrustworthy packaging of products going into or on my body and hair.  I returned the product."
10,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly hair,"This is another product recommended to my son.My son has curly hair and wears it in a few styles. The style of choice is to allow his curls to flow. Given this is the style of choice, my son has been using numerous products as it has been challenging to find one that doesn't flake or cause his scalp to become very dry.I am happy to note, he has not complained and has requested more. So I am certain the product meets the expectations."
11,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works for my summer frizz,This works amazing on my summer frizzy curls. I apply a very small amount and just let my curls dry naturally. The curls stay together nicely. Don’t use too much though or your hair feels dirty and curls are too heavy to stay curly.
12,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,"While it does hold my curls, it doesn't leave them soft and feeling well conditioned.  I have t break them apart still or my hair will look wet all day, more like what a gel does.  The curl and style milk works better for softness so I end up using both at the same time."
13,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The results from using this hair product was devastating.,I was very disappointed with this hair product. It said on the tube moisture and curl Define thick curly hair. I found that it is just the opposite. It actually dried my hair out and took out the curls.
14,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for enhancing waves and curls!,"I have 2c hair that I like to be as curly and moisturized as possible, which is hard in the desert climate I live in. This stuff is the best at helping me keep frizz at bay and define my waves! I apply a tiny amount to my shaggy pixie cut when needed after a shower, and it looks great. Not greasy or gummy or crunchy at all. If you have thick wavy hair that you want to take care of and see more curls from, I recommend this product!"
15,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Warning for people with tree nuts allergies,Don’t buy if you have nut Allergies.

18,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice for thick wavy hair,"I like to use this product to enhance the definition of my very thick, wavy hair to make it look more curly. It smells very nice, like pina colada. The smell fades a little bit with time if fragrance overwhelms you so that shouldn't bother you. I would not recommend this for thin or straight hair, I think it would be too heavy. You only need a little bit of this on wet hair to instantly have better curls. My only complaint is that it is a very fine line between the perfect amount of product and too much, so don't use a lot."
19,"SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut & Hibiscus to Reduce Frizz, 6 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely Moisturizes,OmG I love this product and will definitely order again! It keeps my hair moisturized

It does seam to make it easier to keep a curl and it moisturizes. My only complaint is mine came with out the top part of the flip top, so it's perpetually open.

It needs to be combed every day or it’ll tangle horrible. Its not fun trying to get tangles out of a 3 year old. We love this brand.

0,"SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus with Shea Butter, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Very thick & coconut like scent,"This is a good deep conditioner. It is very thick and weighs my high porosity, medium/coarse ,  type 4 hair down. I mix it with water or a lighter conditioner for better hair penetration. This conditioner does not have much slip (ability to comb through). I detangle my hair before I use this. It does soften and moisturized my hair. The scent is light , smells like hibiscus and more tropical. Overall, I would recommend it to someone with very thick hair and coarse hair however it  was not good for detangling purposes for me and too thick for my preference."
1,"SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus with Shea Butter, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I have been natural for over 10 yrs. I recently did a ""big chop"" to give my hair a new start. This product has brought my dry & course hair back to life. I let it sit in my hair for about 30 min under a heating cap. My hair is super soft & my curls are ""juicy!"" I intend to stick with the Shea Moiture line on my new hair journey."

3,"SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus with Shea Butter, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super hydrating,I put this hair masque on after shampooing. I then cover my hair with a plastic cap and a heated conditioning cap. I leave on for 15-30 minutes then rinse. My hair is ultra soft and manageable. I then use Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle for 2-strand twists. I keep those in for 2 days and I have the most beautiful twist-out!
4,"SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus with Shea Butter, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not amazing on my 2B curly hair,The product came with a cracked top and the seal was open also.I kept it anyway to try the product.

5,"SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus with Shea Butter, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,good,"it left my hair feeling very soft upon drying, but i did remove a star bcse it is supperrr thick, if you are looking for slip in a hair masque this does not have it at all. I have low porosity, type 3 curly course and thick hair and left it on my hair for an hour and covored my hair with 2 plastic shower caps then with my hot head heated cap, it did obsorb really well and i rinsed with cool water, i would use this again but would add oils in it to help with some slip."
6,"SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus with Shea Butter, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,This cream is amazing. I used it on human Brazilian wavy hair. It jumped started the curls and then some. I even tried it on some pre stretched synthetic hair. Look at that hair. The pic is of the synthetic hair that has been curled using the hot water method. The mask didn’t even mess up the curl.

10,"SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus with Shea Butter, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,My hair has no been trimmed in a year due to the pandemic.  I have naturally curly hair but it gets frizzy and especially at the ends once damaged.  I color my hair and live where it is dry.  Winter heating in the house is brutal.

0,SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus Hair Mask with Shea Butter 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,A container of truth for anyone wanting silky smoothness!! Yass!!,"I absolutely love Shea Moisture.. I just wish they could make a bigger size of this coconut 🥥 scented deep conditioner for my curly hair!!I wash my hair with the Shea coconut shampoo first and than apply about a half a golf ball size to my wet parted hair in the shower - start from the top and work the moisturizer to the ends. I do not run it in with my fingers as this actually creates frizz, but rather use I use my palms to smooth it down to the ends of my hair (just a little trick for my curly hair girls out there!)I wait about five to ten minutes and Then I detangle from the ends going towards my scalp with a wide tooth comb. When I tell you that this conditioner is the truth!!! You should not have any hair even come off your head and onto the comb- that’s how smooth and creamy this product is. After a quick rinse you will have ringlets of pure silk on your head!! Before I leave it to air dry , I will apply defining creme (Shea Moisture again! Woop! And only with the hand 🤚 palm technique- woop woop!) and when it’s all said and dry - expect the softest looking curls EVER; you might even slap yourself you look so good!!"

2,SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus Hair Mask with Shea Butter 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best masque I've tried (and I've tried many),"I have very curly, color treated hair and my hair gets DRY.  I have tried many different masques and I always return to this.  I will never stray again.  Love it!!"
3,SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus Hair Mask with Shea Butter 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Just meh.... not impressive,Not really a mask worth writing home about. Probably going to try a different product. It doesn’t moisten it rinses right out leaving your hair still dry feeling. I’ve used many masks and conditioners this just doesn’t meet up to its advertising that’s for sure... the shampoo and conditioner combo fromThis brand is great but I don’t recommend this mask. Save your money for something that works!
4,SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus Hair Mask with Shea Butter 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,NICE deep conditioner BUTTTT…,If you have 4c low porosity hair… you should use this once a month.

7,SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus Hair Mask with Shea Butter 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Weekly treat,"Smell and effect is awesome. I use as a once a week booster for bar conditioners. It makes my curls bouncy and detangles like I never had this 2 feet of rats nest of mess piled up from the gym. For long, course, curly hair I use a quarter size blop and whip it up in my hands, leave it for 10 minutes. Love it."
8,SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus Hair Mask with Shea Butter 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me,I have naturally thick and wavy hair with highlights and lowlights.

48,SheaMoisture Hair Masque for Dry Curls Coconut & Hibiscus Hair Mask with Shea Butter 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cure for straight dry hair!,"Nothing for straight hair ever gives my hair the moisture it needs which led me to textured hair products. This mask is so creamy and thick, not watered down. Gives your hair that “did I not wash this all out, or is my hair really just this soft” feel. It does not keep hair from tangling after styling, but you will notice softness. I did not see any difference in the shine. Great price, mild natural scent."

0,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing that has ever happened to my hair.,"Life changing. I am 34 and all my life I have never liked my natural hair. It air dries ugly and any product I have tried with a diffuser was a heavy fail. So basically I have straightened my hair for as long as I can remember....UNTIL NOW!!This magic foam is epic! I never thought a hair product would change my life but this one did. It's so incredibly light weight, you feel like there is nothing in your hair. I get volume and definition without any of the drawbacks of normal products.I follow the directions of a guy on YouTube named Brad Mondo, he recommends basically saturating your hair with the foam to the point it sound crunchy like you didn't wash the shampoo out. Sounds weird but it works.Given how long my hair is, I probably use about 35 pumps throughout my hair before using a diffuser, possibly more. This gets me about 5 uses in a bottle. Worth it.I am kinda bummed my second bottle doesn't pump foam as well, it's much drippier but it still works.MY METHOD...So what I do is saturate my hair with the foam on 50% air dried hair, diffuse it switching between low hot and low cold and then I spray a few sprays of sea salt spray when I'm about 75% done. Keep diffusing until completely dry and BOOM. Glorious, voluminous, unexpectedly fabulous hair!Hot damn I feel like a babe. I'm sold for life, I've already purchased extras so I never run out.Life changing. Buy it."
1,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall a good product,"This product helps with frizz and definition but doesn’t hold by itself. I just ordered a gel to use after applying this. Also if you have fine 2B/3C hair, I wouldn’t recommend following the directions for how much product to apply- it left my hair limp and greasy looking. just one pump per side works best for me! Overall I’m happy with the product- smells amazing, makes your curls defined/frizz free, but doesn’t hold."
2,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but not best if you want something to shape the curl,"I have very curly hair, like thick ringlets. I love this brand but this mouse would probably work better for less tight curls since I usually like my mousse to shape the curl and this one is not thick enough to do that. It’s more of a watery foam. Good scent and does help with frizz but simply not great for my personal hair type. Probably won’t purchase again but would most likely work for someone with wavy or loosely curly hair :/"
3,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"FRIZZ FREE, CURLS INTACT & FABULOUS SHINE!!","LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I had very straight hair growing up as I got older my hair started getting curly (I grew up having perms put in my hair twice a year) My hair was straight as a pin and very thin Now it’s curly and thick! My hairdresser recommended this brand After I couldn’t find it at my local drugstore She said check Amazon I use the SheaMoistue for curly and thick hair in the Shampoo,Conditioner, the Frizz Control It has a wonderful scent leaves my hair soft and manageable and as with the shampoo & conditioner you don’t need very much to get the job done with EXCELLENT RESULTS!! I LOVE EVERYTHING about this line and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS! (Not to shabby for a white girl)"
4,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this and all healthy!,"I will be using this from now on! It works for my hair, my daughters hair, and my husbands African hair! Great for the whole family and it’s super healthy! I scanned it into my “think dirty” app and it’s in green which means super good and no toxic ingredients!"
5,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"For me, this curl mousse works wonderful! I have naturally wavy thick hair and it always does the trick. Unlike other mooses, it doesn't make your hair crunchy."
6,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Leaves my hair feeling soft. My hair is rather thin and this product leaves my hair feeling light and enhances my kinks and waves in my hair.
7,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what my hair routine needed,"I have been using this line of products for a while now, but just started adding this to my routine. I put it into my hair when it is damp and then let my hair air dry. This product helps control my frizz perfectly without my hair getting crunchy!"
8,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly Girl Appreciated,"I love Shea Moisture products for my curly hair.  I just want to be upfront that I have very pale skin, wavy and thin dry curls. What works for me isn't always going to work for everyone. I have tried over 20 different products/ brands trying to whittle it down to what really works for me.  So my biggest issue recently has been that I want to be able to either air dry my hair or diffuse dry my hair without it looking and feeling dry and frizzy. I also don't want something that has a chemical smell, makes my hair crunchy, greasy, or has parabens and sulfates.I tried most of the other Shea Moisture curl products but none of them have been perfect enough except for the conditioner/ shampoo.  So I wanted to give this a shot. This has been the best one so far for me. Be careful and only use a little until you know how much you really need because it leaves your hair shiny so if you use too much it will make your hair look wet or greasy. A little goes a long way. There is absolutely no frizz or dryness. For now, this is exactly what I wanted and it's affordable which is a bonus.It definitely smells really great and is very light weight and does not add crunchiness but my curls are still really defined and hold pretty well."
9,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not recommended,"I liked the enhancing curl smoothie & the mask. But, this product was a disappointment. My hair went so dry and looked unhealty."
10,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Frizz free!,This product has changed my hair! I have beautiful curls without the frizz!! Magic 🎉🎉
11,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Obsessed!,"I LOVE this stuff! I just had a baby and don’t have time to blow dry/curl/straighten my hair all the time anymore and wanted something that brought out my natural curls and waves without damaging my hair. I was also worried about it being sticky like most mousses, nope! It brings out my natural curls, does not get frizzy and lasts for days! If anything I can just touch up the next day. Plus, I love this brand since they don’t use bad chemicals in their products. Worth it!"
12,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light enough for Caucasian hair,This works nicely on my 2b/2c Caucasian waves/curls! It's light enough where it doesn't weigh down my hair. I put it on wet and then add a little more when I refresh the next day.
13,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,A luxurious must have for all curl types & everything in between!,"I'm not sure what ""sheerness"" or ""thickness"" have to do with a hair product, especially this one lol, buttt... This product is a liquid, and comes out as a simple foam mousse through the pump. I have used this for years, and it works fairly well to keep my crazy curls maintained and in tact. It smells like coconuts and fresh fruity something, like when you walk into a Bath and Body Works, only not overpowering. I have always gotten complimented over the years on how I smell ""like a fruit bowl"" or ""coconuts"" when I'd completely forgotten to put on deodorant or used perfume or scented lotion in those crazy high school mornings LOL hopefully you get it: IT'S THIS STUFF, IT SMELLS JUST THAT FAB! I don't have a specific hair type sadly, I've got a little of everything, it's wavy, curly, and coily in different spots, and this stuff helps with ALL those types all over. It also helps lock in moisture too, and makes it feel hydrated, soft, and smooth, and helps keep the frizzies at bay. I would totally recommend for anyone who has CURLS or coils or a mix of both, sorry but wavy hair doesn't need much hold so I wouldn't recommend because I don't see how it could benefit. I suppose this could help with frizz control for wavy hair, but curls and such, definitely a must to try out, I would highly recommend, it has never disappointed. It also doesn't leave much of a sticky or greasy feeling. Just be sure to apply after spraying your hair with water or when it's slightly damp after washing, or you might think you need more product and put too much in(then it will feel sticky). Remember: a little goes a long way! Give this stuff a whirl for your curls, you'll be dreaming of white sandy beaches and baby crabs and coconut drinks and palm trees swaying in that salty breeze :)"
14,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good luck with packaging,"Should have listened to the other reviews about the packaging issues. Luckily mine didn't leak but, it's completely missing the clear cap that goes over it. Shouldn't there have been a seal to have kept the cap on? Cap isn't even in my box at all.Scent smells good but, for all I know someone just mixed coconut oil and water together and put it back in this bottle. Haven't used in my hair yet but, the stars only come from the good smell and the fact it didn't leave my fingers sticky."
15,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"Perhaps I'm not the target hair type (thin, fine, wavy) for this product, but I bought it because I thought it was curly-girl approved. Maybe it works for other hair types, but for me it does nothing. On the positive side, it didn't do anything BAD to my hair. It just... disappears. I've tried in almost dry hair to style, as well as putting it in wet hair to try setting it. Nothing."
16,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,"First time using mousse - my hairdresser recommended it to combat frizz (I have very thick, long, 2b/2c, extremely frizzy). I am never looking back- not only did I not have frizz, but my hair was so wavy and soft, the texture was even and not stringy. I usually just use oil but I’m NEVER going back to my old routing after this!!! Put it into very wet hair, let it air dry, and voila. That’s literally it!!! (No residue, very light scent, and dried on softy even though I put a lot in my hair, did not dry hard like gel)"
17,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this lightweight curling foam,"I truly love this product. It is so lightweight and doesn't have any hold power so its not crunchy. It creates the perfect curls without looking wet. Again, it doesn't have any stay or hold power so if you want the curls to last, use hair spray. The curls will relax throughout the day even with spray. My hair is extremely challenging because its thin, wispy, no volume, very fine. Its frizzy when I iron, when I hot curl, when I let it air dry. I have been using moose for the last few years but brands vary soooo much that its hard to find a good fit but it still looks wet when defused. I don't care if curls relax as long as its not frizzy. I will be a returning customer. I do wish there was a refill option to reduce plastic and do I don't have to order so many individual bottles."
18,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Frizzy Curls,"I'm not a huge fan of the texture it leaves in my hair. For me this has just been okay, but I hope I can find something better in Taiwan.I usually opt for curl creams rather than mousses, but I tried this since I moved to Taiwan (a place known for humidity). If I place this on the crown of my head it leaves a texture and if I massage it to get rid of the base-like texture then my frizzies come back.My partner has tighter curls than me, this does not do well in his hair at all. While walking his hair just falls apart and goes limp. He has tried using more/less and his hair either clumps or just frizzes terribly.I have been pairing this with conditioner until I can hopefully find a cream in Taiwan that can hold our curls well."
19,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t waste your money,If you have curly hair and need something to help with frizz… do not use this. It doesn’t help at all
20,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Empty bottle,This have never happened to me. The product has arrived as empty bottle.
21,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointing,"After reading all the great reviews, I was hoping this would be just what my hair needed. Sadly it left it feeling like straw when it was dry. I don’t know what happened to the moisture."
22,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"After reading other reviews, I did NOT expect it to provide any hold and it did not. I wanted it for the frizz control, which it did. I have very thick frizzy Hawaiian hair. My hair usually responds well to coconut oil and shea butter so I thought my hair might like this product. Unfortunately, while controlling the frizz it made my hair look dull. It was not oily which is good but I don't want dull hair. It is liquid in the bottle, comes out as mousse, but as soon as you put your hands together, it returns to liquid. I do not see the point in the mousse effect if it's going to be applied as liquid. I also don't like strong fragrance and this has a pleasant mild fragrance."
23,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me,"Tried this several times over the last few weeks on wet, damp, and dry hair with and without diffusing. I have medium length, low porosity, fine, high density 2a hair hoping this mousse would be a light weight style product to enhance my natural waves. I used about 6-8 pumps every time on my hair while scrunching with my hands  and every time my waves just fell after a few minutes. It doesn't hold my hair at all, prevent frizz or fly-aways, or give my hair more volume. I suspect my hair isn't absorbing the product like it should. Instead, I found a gel that works better for me. Most likely will not be buying again.I give 3 stars because it will probably work for some people, just not for me."
24,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product for dry hair,"I have been using more and more sheamoisture products, moving away from Giovanni to something more natural that works well. This mousse is fantastic. Smells pleasant, combs in nicely. However if you have a lot of hair you need A LOT of product not the 4 pumps they say not he bottle. Minimum 6 for me if my hair is already wet right after a shower. Also add a pump on the comb and work it in if you have issues with tangles in your hair. Otherwise I'm 100% recommendinf this. Also look out for other sheamoisture products at bulk stores like Walmart and Costco they have big bottles for a cheaper price that standard sizes at other stores."
25,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good But Not For Me,"The product smelled really good and I was so excited to use it based on the good reviews. Unfortunately, it made my hair feel extremely greasy. It was so greasy to the touch that it was uncomfortable, and didn’t provide my hair with much hold since it had no cast. I have 3b-3c curly hair and unfortunately, I had to return it because it made my hair feel like a grease ball."
26,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight curl definition!,"Works great!I have over processed bleached hair that I love to dye different colors. Because of all this abuse my hair is dry and brittle. Its usually difficult for me to bring out my natural curl without weighting it down. But this stuff really works!It smells great and makes my hair shiny with out it looking greasy.Also, most products contain so much alcohol that it will make my hair color bleed onto my hands while applying. This mousse does not have alcohol that causes my fantasy hair color bleed or run.It you want a light, curl defining, hold buy this!"
27,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not an anti-frizz product!!,"This product actually had a drying effect rather than a moisturizing effect. I braid hair regularly and braids that would have lasted significantly longer, looked horrible just a few hours after application."
28,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,I’m done with all Shea Moisture products,This product is water and fragrance than anything. It comes oilut as a thin watery foam and it had absolutely no affect on my hair. It doesn’t feel or look like it contains anything other water. I smells decent but who cares if it doesn’t work. This was a last ditch effort to use Shea Moisture products because it has been recommended on so many occasions.
29,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT frizz control!,"I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled to do so for this product. I have waist-length very fine wavy hair, and lots of it, so my hair's often frizzy. It's also colored and highlighted, so dryness is a concern. I usually use Redken's Frizz Dismiss, but wanted to try something new. The Sheamoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control is exactly what I need!!I use about 10 pumps (again, waist-length hair) and spread it throughout, then ""crunch"" my hair to activate the natural waves. This product makes the waves much more defined and smooth with zero frizz. I love it!"
30,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,No es buena calidad,Creo q es una copia. Llevo un año comprando ésta marca y es excelente. Pero el de este vendedor no se parece en nada a no que llevo usando.  Su olor no es agradable
31,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Frizz control without sticky heaviness,"This is of foamy consistency and it's light , yet it smooths and holds without heaviness or ""crunchiness."" I have horribly fine, wispy, thin hair with a tad of natural curl.  This stuff is great:  it holds without heaviness.  I run it lightly thru my hair and then scrunch up from ends to roots.  Sets and holds a natural curl ( even with bad hair)."
32,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product!,"This product is absolutely great for anyone with curly hair that is usually too thin or fine for gels! It's light on your hair, but still helps create the needed cast around your curls to help them last throughout the day. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good mousse to use!"
33,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love SheaMoisture, not so much this mousse","I live this brand - I have their shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner (smells so good I was to eat it), etc. But, I am underwhelmed by this mousse. I don't find it does much to help my hair find and hold it's wave. And it still gets frizzy. For now, I haven't found a styling product I like better than Devacurl or Keristasse Curl Manifesto."
34,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not  a styling product but does make hair feel moist.,"I have very curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather.  This product was recommended for curly hair styling.  Not as advertised.  This may be the worst styling product I've tried in 20 years.  If you want to look like Phil Spector during his murder trial and smell like a pina colada, this might be for you.  It just doesn't define curls or hold hair at all.  It did leave hair soft and frizzy instead of dry and frizzy but I won't buy it again."
35,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ineffective - does NOTHING for my hair,"Honestly does nothing for my hair, no matter how I use it. Extremely light weight - maybe thats what makes it ineffective.. seems sometimes like its just an empty, airy product. Like your not putting anything in your hair. And it certainly seems that way."
36,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So light weight, doesn’t work!","I love this line of products, but this particular product does not hold my curl?!  What’s the point!  By the time I got to work I had to braid it down before it poofed up anymore. Like I used nothing. Very disappointing."
37,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great definition without being heavy,"This smells soooo good, first of all. I gave it 4 stars because my bottle had a defective pump, but luckily I was able to decant it into a different mousse bottle and try it out. The mousse itself gives beautiful hold without weighing down my fine, low-porosity hair, and the silk protein doesn't seem to be a problem even though I typically avoid protein. I apply while my hair is soaking wet and it dries beautifully with nice voluminous curls."
38,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice!,"I like it a lot!!!! It really enhances my waves/curls, and it smells really nice. The only thing is that you have to be really careful not to put too much on any piece of hair, bc then it gets that crispy (idk if that's the right word lol!) texture like you get from hairspray. Overall this is a great product though, I use it almost every day :)"
39,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product with safe ingredients,"Wow this stuff really seems like the holy grail of curly hair products. I got it when I noticed that the stuff recommended by my salon contained DMDM hydantoin, which is a ""formaldehyde donor known to slowly leave formaldehyde when coming into contact with water"". I'm so happy I had to replace the old stuff because this new mousse works so much better (and is a lot cheaper too)."
40,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great addition to my wavy girl routine,"I follow the curly girl method. After the squish to condish phase I apply some curling cream, followed by this product. I get pretty good hold, without being crunchy. I apply quite a bit as I then wrap my hair in a turbin to remove excess water and than apply more if needed. It leaves me with defined waves and curls. I will continue to use this."
41,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Give this stuff 10 stars.,"I don’t have a single complaint about this product. It is so incredibly light, which you can tell the minute it hits your hand. My hair is thin, wavy, and very prone to being frizzy. It controlled my frizz and I can’t even tell I have anything in my hair. It smells good. 5 hours in and it’s NOT drying out my hair. Seams every product I use sucks the life out of my hair. This is great!"
42,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells good, but does not work","The smell is great. As far as working, it did nothing. It did not help my curls at all. Still frizzy, which is a huge let down"
43,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for lighter weight hair,"Tried this on my thick coarse hair and it was only moderately moisturizing. I will stick to Original Sprout Curl Control. For my daughter’s thick fine hair, it was perfect and easy for her to apply herself. Smells strongly of coconut, which is pleasant if you like that beach vacation smell. :)"
44,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go to,"My go to favorite product for my hair. It works on different types of curls so I’ve recommended it to my friends with loose curls to tight curls. Plus I’m weird about strong scents, and it has a light scent so I’m a happy camper"
45,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not sure how to feel,"Honestly, I don't love the product, but I don't hate it. It's a cheap product, which is great, but it doesn't really get the job done. It does de-frizz, but if you're looking for it to hold your curls, you'll need to combine it with another product. The consistency is pretty watery, so you don't really notice it's there. The smell isn't strong, it's subtle and pleasant."
46,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,It lays your hair very quickly and doesn't flake!!,"I didn't understand the power of styling mousse like this after braiding my hair bit now I am a true believer. This stuff does not need to be reapplied very often, doesn't flake weirdly or smell strange. It dries very quickly, like not even a full hour if wrapping time needed and it keeps the hair shiny and slayed for quite a while. I love this mousse!"
47,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product too cloudy…,Product appeared tampered with or old …slimy liquid on outer container (but does not appear to be from other product purchased) and liquid content inside appear cloudy. Tried but was unable to contact Amazon customer service via phone or email. So product remains unused in package received  because I’m sure if product is safe to use. And the inconvenience of returning this product to Amazon just makes returning not worth it.
48,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product,  but...","I buy this mousse all the time at target, but bought it here for convenience. The bottle was wrapped with some special grip label so that it doesn't leak. The product did not leak, but the label was extremely difficult to get off! Took at least 5 aggervating minutes!! It was wrapped around multiple times and all crinkled. Couldnt get scissor under it and can't use a knife on a plastic bottle. I lost my grip because the stuff is so strong, knocked over my coffee and then had to clean that mess.  I think I'll make the trip to the store and spare myself the aggervation."
49,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does nothing for frizz,"I will say the product smells amazing, it adds nice volume to your hair and a little structure but does absolutely nothing about the frizz. If anything I think it makes the frizz worse, I will not be buying again."
50,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t Quite Foam…….It’s Runny,I’ve purchased this in a drugstore and it came out in a thick foam. This is part foamish and clear like in the bottle.  I tried cleaning the pump in case it was clogged.  Didn’t help. Not sure if it is old product. It left a dullness on my hair after it dried.
51,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Las Vegas cold dry weather,My daughter has thick corse heavey wavy hair.  Her hair was feeling dry frizzy and brittle. After applying this to her hair and wrapping it in a old t-shirt her hair returned to her natural curle and it keep her curls for days. Amazing how dried out her hair was. She would apply this to her hair approximately every 3 days after washing her hair.
52,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,.My mousse,"I typically purchase this product at brick and mortar however the last time I wanted to purchase it was out of stock. I'm a fan of it. It's not bad on the sticky texture like a lot of other brands. The best use for me of it, is when I combine a portion with water in the spray bottle. It does wonders when I'm wearing my hair wavy or braided up."
53,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Okay,"I purchased this to use on my wigs...It was okay, I did like that it was not sticky, scent was subtle and pleasant not overbearing but I'd rather stick to my argan oil mousse cuz it offers softness and shine for not only my wigs but my natural hair as well!!"
54,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't Weigh Hair Down,I have caucasion wavy hair that can get frizzy.  Love this product!  This is the first mousse that I really like!  It helps me keep my Curls without stickiness or or oiliness.  Keeps hair light and bouncy for days.  My daughter (who has naturally curly hair) also uses this product.
55,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too light weight,Purchased this so I could let my hair airdry and not fuss so much with it.  It ended up being too lightweight  though and my hair just kind of fell.  Didn't like the results.  Also not so sure the scent was anything that great - I was expecting more based on the reviews.
56,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Different ingredients,"Different ingredients on bottle than online, not sure if its the real deal. Also, why is liquid yellowish.  But my hair did feel soft after using this but no shape at all, just flat. This is not creamy foam, its liquidy like soap. Not for wavy hair, too heavy."
57,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for natural curls,"My 9 year old has beautiful curls, and I have finally found the perfect curl quencher in this foam.  This Foam, leaves her curls looking bouncy and moisturized.  I am always using Shea Moisturizer products on her hair, but this is by far my favorite."
58,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe not for bleached hair,"My hair is bleached and fashion colored pink, I have a lot of natural wave and I wanted some definition, this just felt sticky, and made my hair feel stiff no matter how little I used. I agree with reviewers that say you need to shake it to get it to foam, I think my hair might just be too damaged, and the product was too heavy for it."
59,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, a bit watery","This stuff is great for curly hair if you are trying to avoid chemicals and dryness. It is a bit on the watery side, but it smells really good. You need to use a bit more than the average mousse as it is very thin and light, but I have used 2 bottles of it now in 13 months, and I am going to keep using it to control frizz."
60,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, good for wavies & thin hair",I love this curl mousse for my 2b/2c/3a hair! It’s lightweight and is slow to cause any product build up.I use it mostly for refresh days when I don’t want to overload my hair with product!
61,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,I was hoping for a product that helped moisturize (at least a little) as well as style. This product left my hair feeling like straw and I had a lot of breakage with it. I love this brand and this line but I won't be ordering this again.
62,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer for my wavy hair,"I got tired of straightening my hair all the time so I bought this product and their conditioner for curly hair in order to tame my waves. With both these products, I just wash, condition, scrunch, let air dry halfway, apply mousse, and done. Instant waves. I absolutely love these products."
63,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend!,"Both of my kids have thin curly hair. One has curls between 2A and 2B. My other child has 3A curls. This works well for both of them. Tames the frizz, keeps their hair soft, minimizes tangles, and smells good."
64,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,No safety seal,I didn't appreciate my mousse already being opened and no safety seal at all... seems like a warehouse deal that I didn't get a warehouse price for...
65,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Item arrived very damaged with no cap,The mousse itself is great but unfortunately the item came very damaged with no cap resulting in a scratched bottle and some leakage.
66,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Weighed down hair and curls,More watery unlike a typical mousse. Weighed my hair and curls down. Wanted a change from normal routine; even coworkers commented that my hair wasn’t as big and bouncy.
67,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft hair,"This stuff makes my hair soft and touchable not sticky at all.. I have curly hair and it always frizzes, this manages it.  I don’t get as much of a curl with this mousse as I do others but I love the softness it gives my hair and the no frizz"
68,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me,This product is very watery. It just saturated my hair. Not a mousse at all.
69,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,10/10,I’ve been using this a short while I have frizzy curly hair that goes out of control. This in my hair after I dampen it. Does amazing things. I was able to dry shampoo and do that to get a few more days of an actual hair style. Not just a bun. That is amazing. It’s not greasy and the shine is perfect!
70,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to like this stuff, but...","I really, REALLY wanted to like this stuff. It didn’t do anything for my hair except make it smell good. I have long hair (navel length) so maybe that’s part of it, but still frizzy over here. Been looking for a mousse-like product that’s made cruelty-free to replace the store brand garbage I’ve been using for years. This isn’t the winner."
71,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lightweight mouse for curly hair,"Likes…lightweight, does not pull in my hair or feel sticky.Dislikes I need to use at least 8  pumps to get the curls to stay in my hair. I have medium-fine natural curly hair."
72,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,I have about 5 of these hair products from this company and I use it  every day the scent is amazing great with my hair and really gives me a confident boost I also read a story of how they came from very intresting and unique Love this product !!

74,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for me,I needed something that was a light mouse that I could get from a pump due to the arthritis in my hands. This is perfect and is working well to replace my previous brand of mouse. Perfect idea. Great product. Mild scent (important for my asthma). My hair does very well with the product.
75,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love It,I use this for my twist out. The product is light and not sticky. The scent is awesome and very subtle. Not too loud. I use this product weekly and a little goes a long way!

77,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wont buy again,I really do not have much to say about this product. My hair still looked frizzy after applying. I have used better products. Only good thing is that it is lightweight and smells fine. No I will not be buying this product again and I bought a couple bottles too.
78,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this,"Super moisturizing and defines my curls beautifully. No overpowering scent and extremely lightweight. I do go through a whole bottle in two weeks though, thank goodness the price is cheap."
79,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,I just don’t like it. I don’t like a manual mousse pump the product doesn’t stay puffed when it comes out and it’s a runny mess. It doesn’t do anything for my curls. My hair looks fluffy with no hold. I returned it.
80,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG YES!!,"This completely transformed my curls after just one use! No frizz and such beautiful curls made with this product. I am very impressed and surprised, especially because this is so affordable!"

Had to apply it multiple times to avoid frizz. Not good as claimed imo."
82,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s not bad!,This mossue not back. I liked its hold Bc After doing my hair it’s not a film on my braids like the gel which gets in my parts.

84,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for type 2C curl.,"This is perfect for those of you, like me who have type 2c curl.

Definitely a winner. Smells great,  light weight, moisturises the hair well. One pump goes a long way.Applied it to my damp locs, then put it in Bantu knots overnight.  I was surprised at the definition. Curls held up pretty well."
293,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,I love this mousse I use it alone after shampoo
294,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for fine curly hair,"I have very fine hair, and my curls fall/dont take very easily. Most products such as gels, lotions, and other mousses are way too heavy and leave me with straight but poofy hair. This is the only styling product i trust to encourage my curls and keep them going (since my hair is so fine i have to refresh every day/every other day). I have tried so many different products and this is the only one i have stayed with for 10+ years, along with the shampoo and conditioner from the same line."
295,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product for thick curly hair,"I have super thick curly/wavy hair, partially wavy and lots of corkscrew curls. This is wonderful. Not crispy crunchy old school mouse. It comes out of a container in sort of a soft wet foam rather than the old style super thick foam. It offers a soft hold and well defined air dried curls for my really thick hair. LOVE IT."
296,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,No joke the best hair mousse i’ve ever tried,"I LOVE THIS STUFF. My hair is naturally very wavy, but also VERY frizzy. And with my hair getting long, it’s been weighed down a lot so the waves haven’t really been holding with my usual Gariner mousse. BUT THIS - this mousse is lightweight, but SO effective. It doesn’t leave my hair stiff, and hold natural shape so beautifully! Will continue to buy - 10/10"
297,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely not,NOPE. My hair is a spiral curl. This is what I got from this product. Zero definition. It’s frizzy. Never using it again.
298,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh for 2b/c hair,I ran out of my garnier curl mousse and picked this up to try something new. Love the smell but it doesn’t give great definition/hold for my hair type
299,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Container Opened, Can't Return","Bottle looks as if it opened and spilled or was with items that spilled but product still used. Though full, label is sticky and appears old. No option to return. All I could do was cancel my ""subscribe and save"". With no way to know whether previously opened, having no tamper proof plastic, I'm very uncomfortable with using product on my hair. BUTTER BEWARE!"
300,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for naturals,Great on my 4c hair !

303,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for braids.,Perfect for wash day with braids. I use this after wash/conditioning my braids and then put a wrap/scarf on my hair for at least and hour. Keeps the frizz down and my braids stay looking fresh. Braids one month old in pic posted.
304,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally!,"Finally I found a mousse that suits my 3-A/3-B curls! It's not heavy, sticky, crunchy, but keeps frizz under control."
305,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product for long lasting, frizz-free curls","I used to use the deva curl foam, which I do love, but is super expensive. This works just as well for a fraction of the cost (and contains as high quality ingredients, if not higher, than Deva curl). I apply it in the morning right out of the shower and my curls are still intact and frizz free at the end of the day.Also, personally I like that the company uses fair trade ingredients in a lot of their products. Definitely worth supporting an ethical company, especially when the product is *genuinely good*"
306,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,I think I like it!,"Oooh...first day trying it, and for my fine hair, this works nicely! Curl are held softly and full, but not frizzy.  My curl tends to draaaaag down easily with a lot of products, but this feels light and nice. Only one day in, but I look forward to trying it for day 2 hair, and also perhaps with some other smoothing or curl-defining products. But I could definitely see this being something I use on its own often!"
307,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,So soft curls,"I bought the shampoo, conditioner, style & curl milk, and this mousse. I’ve always hated my curls because I’ve never found products I love. Well I love these and leave my hair to air dry and not up in a bun all the time now. My hair is not super thick or tight beautiful curls but wavy and frizzy. Especially in this Florida humidity, sometimes straightening your hair is a waste of time. Every time I use these products I feel like it enhances the curls. And they are so soft still, not all stiff and crunchy. 🥰😍 Also love that there is not a strong scent."
308,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will buy again!,"I put it on wet, dried non crunchy! That never happens. Super soft, no frizzy crazy. I don't think it really has a smell but works so good. No bad ingredients like alot of things we buy. You should definitely try it!"
309,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I AM HAPPY,I love love this product
310,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,More of a foamy liquid,"Comes out of bottle as a foamed liquid instead of mousse-like foam.

328,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for wavy refreshes!,"I have recently started my natural hair journey with 2c/3a hair.  On day two I've been spraying my hair down with water and scrunching a bit of this product in and it really refreshes my hair, but I do find it a tiny bit drying so I recommend adding some leave in conditioner as well."
329,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Looks like 1/2 of liquid was missing from bottle. Outside of bottle is sticky too.

336,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Eh,"If you use too much hair can feel sticky, stiff, and dry in a way.

339,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ehh.,"Honestly, there are better products out there. Makes my hair look super dry and frizzy, un-natural looking, and makes it feel hard and crisp.My hair has a natural curl to it, and this product actually makes the curl look WAY worse.. Almost like I tried too hard to get it to curl.I’m sure it works well for some, but not me!"
340,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I love how it feels like I don’t have any product in my hair. I have my natural curls back

Never greasy the next day. Smells sound and feels lightweight in your hair. I use on my hair only when it's dry though, just for frizz in the mornings"
346,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,The equivalent of putting foam soap in your hair.,"This product was the consistency of foam soap. I bought it for a trip to Mexico after reading that it helped thick dry hair with the intense humidity. I also purchased because other reviews commented on how nice it smelled.  The product I received was the equivalent of foam soap.  It did nothing to block the humidity from frizzing my hair.  It felt like once the product dried it evaporated completely from my hair.  I have very thick wavy hair that is hard to manage in humidity and I really had high hopes for this product. I was definitely disappointed. It is not at all a mousse and it is also not scented at all.  I will say it is very light weight, but I am convinced that this is because the product is actually just foamy water."

350,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair was fried off after having hair down to my waist,"I wanted to replace my mousse for something better, and after coming across another review about a woman in her 30s using this I thought why not give it a try. It has been a little over a year my hair has been fried and I’ve been trying to let it grow out, feels like a bristle brush I cry every time I look at it my hair was my identity. I had my hair in an updo for my wedding because it was so damaged. I used this stuff in my hair and WOW ITS NEVER FELT SO SILKY SMOOTH I WANT TO CRY. Gonna stock up on this. I blow dry it afterwards to give it a beach wave effect but it doesn’t have much hold at all since it’s so lightweight so I add a little hair mousse just to keep the texture. Add to cart, close your eyes and place order I’m telling you this is the best thing you could ever do for your hair. You’ll realize after your next shower how silky it feels!!!"
351,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,liked it a lot used it on my braids
352,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh…,"Very light weight, which is fabulous for curls, but it just didn’t give me much frizz control. I didn’t notice any difference in using no product vs using this product. Also, the whole bottle was used up in two weeks. For me, it wasn’t worth the price."

354,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Used product,I love this product. Unfortunately Amazon sent me a used bottle with no lid and almost half empty. You are better off buying this product in person.
355,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight but doesn’t work very well in my hair,"I have very damaged hair due to many dye jobs, so I was hoping this would help with my frizz out in Hawaii. Unfortunately for my hair, it doesn’t control the frizz much, and the frizz it does control is only stuck together. However on the positive side, it smells great and feels lightweight in my hair, so it may just be the fact that my hair is trashed already that it doesn’t work for me."
356,SheaMoisture Curl Mousse for Frizz Control Coconut and Hibiscus with Shea Butter 7.5 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Back for my 4th bottle,"My stylist wanted a bottle, so I surprised her for Easter early!"
0,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Make your curls Pop and Shine,"This product is very moisturizing and excellent for natural hair styles and wash and go. I would recommend this product for type 3b 3c, 4a Hair. I used it instead of gel to really make my curls pop. After deep conditioning I add leave in conditioner to damp hair and then a detangler. I add this product last and comb through with my fingers and let hair dry and defuse and my curls pop for a week."
1,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have 2c-ish curly hair, and though this product can be heavy, I find that if I apply it to freshly washed hair that I've only just squeezed the excess water out of, and apply in moderation then it works really well. I'm very sensitive to scents and so a lot of the other leave in products are out based on scent alone, this is one that I am not allergic to and so it's my go-to. My hair is waist length, thin and fine, and I use about a large grape sized amount. I use prayer hands to apply it and then comb it through and scrunch. Then I put my hair in a microfiber towel for about 10 minutes and I find this is the perfect amount & procedure for my hair."
2,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best curl cream I've ever had.,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I have naturally curly hair and I am trying to get it back to being healthy, so I'm doing the curly girl method. I was using cantu curl activator, but got this because I couldn't order the other one on Amazon during this time.Well, I am so glad that I did! This cream does a much better job. It moisturizes my curls very much, and it even adds bounce. I have included a video to show just how bouncy it makes my curls!In addition, it has a very strong coconut scent. This might be a bit too strong for some people, but I love it."
3,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works miracles ❤,Listen ive only had this product less than a half hour. Only tried a small amount about ten minutes ago and here I am writing a review. The scent alone won me over but the instant change in my hair speaks volumes.  Its just that great my hair is soft moist and smells like paradise if thats even a scent. I cant wait to shampoo and condition with the products tonight and and get the full experience. I didn't rate the drying properties yet because my hair isnt dry at all. If they mean did it leave it wet the answer is no but its really moist as in not dried out then 5stars it is. And i have extremely dry hair as in m6 hair usually drinks products and be dried out in no time. Not with this. I highly recommend l.

5,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,REALLY wanted this to work,"I have been on a ""curl journey"" and have been searching for the perfect leave in that was affordable. I REALLY wanted this to be the one. I have 2c/3a hair thats super frizzy and coarse and so need a lot of moisture but this was overly moisturizing and left my hair feeling weighed down and greasy (which never happens). I tried to use less the next time I used it, but then it just left my hair frizzy. Also I had read people having trouble with the bottle and I totally agree, i didn't think it would be a big deal but it's so hard to get out of the bottle, I had to take the cap off with my second use."
6,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Daily Moisturizer,"Ive been using this product for years. I use it as an intense moisturizer whenever I wash and dry my hair. After I dry my hair its still generally moist, I then use this to start my moisturizing process."
7,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells and works great!,Amazing smell! One of my go-to’s for curly hair. Moisturizes and doesn’t leave my hair dry.
8,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,May be too heavy for some types of hair,"This smells wonderful, but it is super thick & difficult to get out of the bottle. I have 2b wavy Caucasian hair & purchased this based on positive reviews from a different website. I used a small amount on freshly washed, just out of the shower hair, and let air dry. This left my hair sticky & gummy. It was not moisturizing but also didn’t leave my hair crunchy. It was just very heavy & made my hair feel & look dirty from the heaviness of the product."
9,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,White hair? You need this.,"I used to be a mall 'Santa'. My hair was a little salt and pepper so I had my hair bleached white. Eventually, I learned how to bleach it safely by myself. I haven't been a Santa Claus for several years now but I still bleach my hair. I think it looks good that way and I get lots of compliments. Of course, I use a 'blueing' conditioner periodically to keep the yellow out.But, a couple of years ago I found this product. I found that after washing my hair and before using a gel to style it, I can work in SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk and it not only makes my hair a beautiful bright white, but it also makes it easier to style...even using a low temp hair dryer....to style it into shape before working in a little gel. It works so well for long white hair...and real beards...that I wrote to a large 'Mall Santa' providing company I formerly worked for and urged them to memo all of their more than 300 'Santa's with information about using the product.  It smells great...coconut and hibiscus....and is great for your hair. Not sure but I would guess it would be nice for hair that's other than white, also.  Try it!"
10,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Holy Cow and WOW! UPDATE,"No matter how many products I try, I keep coming back to this curl milk! It’s wonderful. It’s moisturizing. But most importantly, for me, it blends with my favorite gels!! YAY! Life is about the little things... I’ll keep this curl milk as my little thing.  (UPDATE):  After two purchases... COME ON SHEA MOISTURE!  Put this milk in a different container.  Why do I have to cut the damn top off to get to the product?  Can't you see this milk is TOO THICK for this packaging.  I (we as customers) need you to do better."
11,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,100% for thick hair,"I can’t get enough of any Shea Moisture product but if you have thick, curly hair you don’t need to make another purchase but Shea Moisture. My hair holds curl for almost a week with no curling iron or rollers to deal with. The shine and feel of my hair since using this product is extraordinary. I use the shampoo, conditioner and smoothie together and also condition my hair a couple of times a month with the leave in conditioner. Stop buying those other brands because this is all you need for healthy and curly thick hair."
12,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best thing for curly hair!,"I have never used a product like this before. I have curly hair and use conditioner. Typical, I would use moose and or gel to manage my style. I wanted something that was lighter, not sticky, and wouldn’t make my hair oily and last All Day!!! I read reviews and decided to order. I googled style milk and curly hair style tips and I have to say….. after showering i towel dry my hair. While it is still damp, I place a dime size dot in my palm and work through my hair. A few tips said that I could use a gel AFTER adding a milk or leave in moisturizer to get a wet look and that’s does seem to work. This leaves my hair soft, light and smells like coconut. If you add too much, it will make your hair oily but you just have to find your right amount. I have had this a few months and my hair seems to be in a better condition and it doesn’t seem like I’ve used hardly any out of the bottle!!! Definitely my new hair secret!"
13,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Too thick, weighs hair down, dries it out.","Very thick ! Had to store it upside down and squeeze very hard to get any out. Also too heavy for my thin, wavy hair . Makes it sticky and knots it when I try to run my fingers through. I even tried mixing some with water and putting it into a different container.Did nothing for moisturizing and actually caused drying and frizz.I was really shocked, because I usually like the products from this brand. Very disappointed ."
14,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes buy it,OMG I love it. It smells so good and works great.
15,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, smells even better","I love this stuff. First off, it smells AWESOME, which is truthfully one of the most important metrics for me when it comes to hair products. I usually apply it on wet hair just after getting out of the shower, scrunch and plop for a bit to get some of the water out, then diffuse on cool, and my curls come out much shinier and better defined than if I do the same routine without this product. Well worth the money I spent on it and will definitely be getting more when I run out."
16,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works pretty good for my 2b/2c hair type!,I bought this cause it was cheap and I needed to get away from cantu. Cantu is the only styler I've ever used and this one is way better for me. I saw the reviews and was a little sceptical but it was 5 dollars so I didn't have much to lose. The scent is not overbearing to me I think the cantu smell is way worse. It's smells like a calm coconut scent not really like dryer sheets like people are saying. It is kinda hard to get it out of the bottle but it's fine. It doesn't weigh my hair down and it definitely does moisturize my hair. There's not so much dryness in my hair and my curls are actually defined. I thought this wasn't gonna work on my hair type but it really does!
17,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for my hair,This product made my hair very hard
18,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Is this Actually White Glue?,"I wanted very much to like this product. I wanted it to make my 3C curls smooth, soft, shiny and defined. Well, I really disliked this product. First, it is so thick that it cannot be dispensed from the  bottle. I could not squeeze it through the cap, I could not squeeze it with the cap removed. It is almost a solid. Not a liquid. I had to mix it with water to get a usable consistency.This product does NOT leave my hair feeling moisturized, at all. It leaves my hair feeling slimy, coated and heavy.I would not purchase this again. The packaging alone frustrated me so much that I was already furious by the time I finally managed to get a tablespoon of this goop out of the bottle.I do not recommend this product."
19,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This hair product gives my hair LIFE!!!,"I love this curl and style milk!!! It helps tame lots of unwanted frizz and enhances my natural curls... All you need after adding this to your hair is some moisturizing oil (argan, avocado, almond, and or coconut oil to name a few) and curl defining gel... Then braid or twist your hair, leave it on for a few days, and take it down. Before you know it, you will find yourself with well defined curls and waves that'll last for over a week."
20,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I must've gotten a bad batch,This conditioner was so thick it wouldn't come out of the bottle even after letting it sit upside down for days on end.  I even left it in hot water for an hour and nothing.  I had to take the cap off squeeze the bottle hard for clumps of conditioner which was not creamy.  It was dense but it didn't moisturize my hair.  If anything it left it dry and hard to untangle.  The shampoo wasn't much better.
21,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely, LOVE this product...","This is the only product that I have found that tames my curls. I have naturally curly, unruly, frizzy hair. All of my life I have struggled to find a great hair product. I have found it with SheaMoisture curl & style milk. It smells so good and leaves my hair soft, silky, smooth, and best of all it tames my frizz. I have tried so many other products that say that they will eliminate frizzy hair, however, they either leave my hair feeling greasy, oily, or they will work at first but as the day goes on they ultimately fail. I have been using this product for about 6 months. I wanted to make sure that the product really worked for my hair and it has exceeded all of my expectations. I recommend this product to all my friends, family, and anyone I think would benefit from using it. I definitely suggest purchasing this product."
22,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Your curls need this,My hair was a frizzy mess. This stuff has saved me from hassling with taming my frizz all day. It keeps my curls together and my hair looks healthy! It’s magic in a bottle!
23,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for curly hair,"I really love this product but it is so thick that it will not come through the little hole in the dispenser top so I have to unscrew it every time and store it upside down. Having said that, it’s a great product at a reasonable price for those of us with curly hair. The smell is very pleasant without being overwhelming."
24,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Eh...,"Purchased because I was trying to use the line of products for my son's hair (I have the shampoo & conditioner combo, plus curling creme). Didn't expect it to be so thick.Didn't seem to do much to his hair.  Leaves a bit of a film.  I've also tried dilute it in some warm water to make it more like a spray.I'll try again to see if either way works (out of bottle and as diluted solution).I've also ordered the mousse to combat frizz, will see if it works."
25,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Greasy, heavy, overall ineffective","Pros:Smelled pretty niceA little goes a long wayDoes enhance curlsCons:Very greasy productLeaves your hair heavy and flatCurls/waves only last about an hour or two because I have fine hairOverall:I have very fine but thick 1B-3B hair and this product did not work for me at all. It left my hair greasy and weighted down. While my hair did curl to some degree with this product, my hair became frizzy and lost definition with the use of this product. My hair is simply too fine to have this product but it may work for other hair types. Overall, I would not recommend this product for individuals with similar hair types to me. I will be returning this product."
26,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,New recipe perhaps?,"I know a product consistency can change based on weather and temperature but it seemed like the overall recipe has been changed. It's thicker and denser. It used to be thinner and runnier. But now it's heavy and leaves a white cast. And I've used this on me and my daughter's hair (she's 4a and I'm 4c). It used to penetrate our hair and moisturize it effortlessly. Now, it's like a thick custard that'll just sit on top of the hair to seal in moisture. I'm extremely displeased with my purchase. I also mixed it with purified water and am not still happy about the outcome."
27,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Shampoo!,"I would love to see a larger bottle with a pump possibly. I am allergic to many shampoos. They give me sores on my neck or a sore throat. This shampoo is the best ever. Smells beautiful, moisturizes but doesn't leave hair weighed down. I'm not allergic to the scent or ingredients. It won't destroy you if you get it on your face or you forget to rinse some out. It gives beautiful curls. My guys keep getting into my shea moisture products. Shea Moisture is my favorite!"
28,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent,"I have very long 2A/B hair & started the CGM back in September. My hair seems to like this more now that it's winter, in the warmer months it didn't seem to do as well with it. I've used it as a leave in just by itself without styling & it seems to help my curl memory. I've used it underneath a few other stylers too & it works well. I don't need a ton, maybe a quarter sized amount for my entire head so it's lasting me a while. The smell is nice without being overpowering."
29,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Change the container,"I love Shea Moisture! I’m just not feeling the squeeze bottle because the product isn’t one you can just shake gently and the product pumps through. I have to hit it, shake it, and squeeze pretty hard and then still have to take the top off to get the product out which wastes too much time and energy. I have arthritis in hands and a bad shoulder so this is torture. Maybe change the container to a screw off top."

   I'm currently growing my hair down to my butt and it's 3/4 of the way there and I have tried every anti frizz serum on the market almost and had found this by accident but tried it anyway and so far it's been the best product that I ever bought for my long thick wavy/curly hair!! There is no such thing ""as a little bit goes a long way"" with super long curly hair and expensive ass hair serum or thick conditioner. My hair is so thick and so frizzy. I am constantly fighting humidity in the Midwest but also want long beautiful healthy hair that isn't dry dull and frizzy or greasy from ""serum"" or stiff from too much mousse and gel. My hair just soaks up this product and it looks absolutely beautiful all day I no longer have to use hairspray either or mousse just the hair milk while its wet/damp and go. No frizz. No greasy dirty weird shine. Just pretty natural looking healthy shine and its ability to moisturize all of my hair every day is amazing! The conditioner is incredible as well!!"
31,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,High Quality and Adaptable to Different Hair Types,"I have fine, wavy/curly hair, and I love using this product after I've showered. It helps define my curls and eliminate frizz without being stiff or greasy. My husband also loves using this in his beard, and we recently began using it in our daughter's very fine thin hair to prevent tangling and knots. The value and quality of this product has been incomparable among the products that I've tried over the years."
32,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,This is the first product I have tried that actually separates the curls in my very curly “white “ hair!! Can’t say enough good about it!!My only negative is that it’s impossible to get it out of the bottle! Even squeezing with all your might barely gets anything out! It would be much better in a jar!
33,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too thick,It's just too thik/conditioning for my hair. I expected the coconut smell/scent even though it's not my favorite. The stuff is so thick it would barely squeeze out of the bottle. My hair felt like I was using mayo. I'll still use about once a week as a deep conditioner and wash out in morning. Can absolutely not use this for during the day wear.
34,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Always comes rancid.,"I have bought this product more times than I can count, if I had to estimate, probably around seven or eight times, because as far as moisturizing goes, it does a pretty good job. That said, it's incredibly thick and heavy, and it has ALWAYS come with signs of going rancid. I think its a problem with this specific product, opposed to the actual seller, as I've bought it in store as well as from the official Shea Moisture website. It always comes slightly oxidized with a strong ""wet dog"" and ""play-doh"" smell to it, that to me, makes it borderline unusable. Oils going rancid isn't a massive threat to your hair, and as long as it's not moldy it's technically safe to use, but when I can find products that perform better in a similar range, I'm not sure this ones worth it."
35,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Product,"Highly recommend! I have thick, wavy hair. It gets frizzy easily but most curl products leave it feeling stiff & weighed down. This stuff is amazing! It provides exactly what I need without leaving my hair feeling like I have a thick buildup of product in it. It smells good too! I wish it came in a larger bottle but a little really does go a long way so it's still worth the price!"
36,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,the bottle ruins the product,What good does it do to develop a good product and then attempt to sell it in a bottle that is impossible to use? This thick styling cream needs to either be in a soft squeezable tube or a jar where you remove the top and dip into the cream.  I am so annoyed that I spent money on this product -- never again (in this packaging).
37,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,This is the only thing that ACTUALLY gets rid of my frizz.,"This is the best anti-frizz hair product I’ve ever used. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the bottle! The bottle sucks. It’s really hard to get the product out. I wish they’d put it in a squeeze bottle like toothpaste is in but bigger. Otherwise, the product itself is amazing."
38,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,I had high hopes for this product. I’ve used Cantu but it dries out my hair so I tried to use the SheaMoisture Curl and Enhancing Smoothie but that didn’t work for me. (I have 3c/4a low porosity hair.) I bought that from Walmart and got a refund. I bought the Curl and Style Milk hoping that would work for me. It left my hair frizzy. I don’t think SheaMoisture products work on my hair but i do love the smell of this product.
39,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing!,I did some research on curl cream before I bought this and I decided to try one for a decent price before getting one from a salon or Ulta and paying double and it not working. this product though is amazing! my hair is usually frizzy and the curls are different on each side of my head. i used this and not only is the frizz mostly gone and the curls are the same all around my head... the curls are more like coils and it looks so healthy and amazing! definitely will keep buying!
40,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great curl cream and amazing scent!!!,This Shea moisture is one of my favorite of all the Shea moisture products. The scent is so amazing. To curl milk is not too this or too thin and works great used first as a leaving and/ or in combination with other creams and gels. I also think this product would work great for many curl types as it’s not greasy or too heavy as long as you start by adding a little and work your way up.
41,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the money,My curly hair look beautiful......I loved
42,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointing,"I was so trusting and excited to try this product for my course, thick curly hair. Unfortunately, it did nothing for my frizz, even though, I wrapped my damp hair in a towel for about 10 minutes after applying so the product could work best with the heat of the towel. This is how I got optimal results from other products. This produce worked as well as dollar store products have in the past. Wish I could have tried before buying. Expensive experiment especially if I have to keep this trial and error experiment going."
43,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,A problem for the manufacturer!,"Overall, I like the product however, it's so thick I can't get it out of the plastic bottle.  It won't come out even it you turn it upside-down.  I need to find a narrow stick to scrape it out when I want to use it.  I won't reorder it because of this.  The Shea Moisture in the jar is user friendly and works quite well.  This is a total disappointment!!!!"
44,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have natural curls, and I LOVE this! No more bad curl days.","I have tried dozens upon dozens of products for my super-curly-white-girl hair over the past 45 years. No joke. This one is my new favorite. Holds my curls: with bounce and without frizz. I mix it with argan oil and apply them together, and I love the results. I have shoulder length thick hair and just a dime-sized amount covers my head. Even my family has noticed the difference in my curls, and the lack of ponytails that I wear when I'm having a bad curl day. No more bad curl days for me!"
45,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Weighs down my thin hair,"I wanted to love this product but it’s such a thick cream it really weighs down my hair and I have really thin hair. Didn’t work for me and I wouldn’t recommend it if you have thin hair because it will make it look like less. Smells nice thoAlso, it’s true that you can’t get the product out of the bottle. It’s so think that it won’t pour out so you gotta open the bottle and smack it on your hand to get a little. Poor design."
46,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally found a solution,"My naturally curly hair would often frizz after only a few hours, especially after brushing. This product is a game-changer! It has also allowed me to blow my hair straight without the usual frizz. This product works better than anything I've tried so I am surprised the price is so reasonable  My hair has never looked better both natural or dried straight! I am excited to try all the Shea Mositure products!"
47,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay Product,"When I bought this at the store before I loved it for my curls and finished the product. After purchasing this product online, it arrived and didn’t have the same easy consistency as the one before had. Functional-wise I think it works okay, but it is really stiff and difficult to squeeze out when that shouldn’t be the case. I’d advise trying to find it at the store first before resorting to ordering online!"
48,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So moisturizing, gorgeous fragrance, leaving my hair so soft.","This product leaves my hair so moisturized, and soft. The scent is gorgeous and lingeries.However as the website explains it is for a certain hair curl which was too heavy for me.They explain how to mix it with conditioner etc., but it’s a little heavy for my hair.Try it for your hair because the benefits are awesome if it works for your hair."
49,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too oily,I used this to do overnight foam curclers with my daughter. It did curl her hair but it is too oily and did not hold her curls that long that I have to use hot curling iron on her before she goes to the stage.. the hair spray I used also didnt help because her hair was already oily from this product. Waste of money
50,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"Great product.  I bought this to try on my thin, grey, frizzy hair.  I am surprised it works great for me.  My hair is softer, shiney and the ends are not frizzy.  My only problem is getting it out of the bottle.  I am going to look for the product in a jar not a squeeze bottle.  My daughter tried it and she loves it also."
51,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,So blah,"I LOVED the smell, unfortunately that's the only thing I liked about this product. I have curly dry hair and this product left my hair dull and not moisturised at all. I couldn't even run my fingers through it without them getting stuck as if I have washed my hair for 3 weeks. I tried using it a second time, but it just made my hair look dirty and felt heavy. I definitely don't recommend this product."
52,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for Fine Curly Hair,My search was for outside fine curly hair products and this was the first one. The organic part is awesome. None of the bad things are in this products. And it's Fair Trade which is wonderful. The small print on the bottle that said For Thick Curls but nowhere else. So if you have thick curls and want a healthy product for your hair then this is it..
53,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t live up to the hype - don’t buy,"Was very excited to try this as I have heard nothing but great things about SheaMoisture. I have type 2c/3a curls and this seemed like a good fit. The smell is unremarkable which is rather have than something overpowering. The cream is very thick but didn’t really provide any hold. It didn’t give curl definition at all, and my hair didn’t seem moisturized but instead looking very greasy even though I just showered. Very disappointed"
54,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,I can't get this product out of the bottle!!,"I was not very please with the way this product leaves my hair, but the worst is how difficult is to get this product out of the bottle.  The product is too thick to come in this type of package.  It would be easier to use if the product comes in a jar.I don't recommend this product!"
55,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,YES!,"I wasn't sure why but lately my hair had been feeling really dry (maybe the weather?). My hair needed a serious moisture boost. I tried a few different things like different oils and deep conditions, but still felt my hair dry. Yesterday, after I co-washed, I applied this product and it gave my hair a really good moisture boost and shine, but without weighing it down or making it look greasy. Now I'm not sure if it's the co-wash coupled with the cream, but my hair is feeling heavenly right now!! ( I don't usually condition-wash but just wash regularly but since I had washed my hair just a day ago, i co-washed to reduce dryness). Yes sheamoisture!"
56,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,a must have for curly hair,"this is a wonderful product for curly hair! it leaves my hair very soft, moisturized and the scent is nice. fair warning a little goes a long way. i have curly, shoulder length, fine hair and this is just the right amount of product for my hair type. i will definitely order again."
57,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hair is stiff after use, and no real conditioning at all","I thought this product would leave my hair softer and would provide moisture to my thick, curly dry hair.  No.  It made my hair very hard to comb, and even if I air dried it, the curls were still stiff and unmanageable.  Have curly,  dry, color treated hair and was disappointed it didn't help with conditioning."
58,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Formula change? Not great,I rebought this item on amazon because I bought it from a store originally. I think they’ve thinned out their formula because the batch I receive is literally ...water. It holds no moisture and does not help in de tangling in anyway. I’m pretty bummed because I finally thought I found my perfect conditioner. Hopefully it’s just a batch issue.
59,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for my curly hair and NO FRIZZ,"I love this product! I have natural curly curly hair and trying to keep it moisturized and not frizzy is a challenge. BUT NO MORE!! This has helped my hair! Not only does it smell great, it conditions and controls my frizz even in humidity and rain!! Also I can get up day 2-3 and wet and go only adding a small amount of product."
60,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok,"This made my hair feel super greasy. I don't feel like I used that much, but yet it made it feel stiff, like straw, and greasy in some areas. Love the smell! I was looking forward to this product, but I'm not really happy with it. I think the texture of my hair changed after having kids and I was hoping this would make it look like it used to before kids, but not at all."
61,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not dispense,"II used for the first time today. My problem is the conditioner is so thick that it will not come out of the dispenser. I have to screw off the lid and put my finger in to get anything out. This will not work. The scent is a little strong in the beginning but it seems to have toned down. It’s a nice scent. And it seems to be doing a good job on my hair, which is great. But the container is a real problem! I don’t think I can use it!"
62,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Can't get it out of the bottle!,I can't get it out of the bottle! How did everyone get it out?? I'm thinking about cutting the top and putting it in another container. It should be in a tub.
63,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow my hair is so pretty!,My hair has never looked better!
64,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super Moisturizing,"This product works perfectly for my daughter's dry hair, in conjunction with other Shea Moisture products and Jamaican Black Castor Oil to seal in the moisture. It's thick, smells really good, and truly seems to keep her hair moist. Will definitely purchase again."
65,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Really nice product,I love this hair cream so much! It really made my hair feel so nice and moisturized it well. Only thing that sucks about it is the bottle it comes in. Trying to squeeze the cream out was really difficult. Luckily I had an extra “pump” that fit perfectly so I just pump out the product. Other than that it’s a great product
66,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Used to love but now my hair hates it,"I used to love this product and it used to work wonders in my hair when I was in high school. Now my hair hates it and get dry after a day. The scent is great and the price is good for the amount you are getting, but I dont think I can use it anymore. I am still a lover of sheamoisture and will stick to their deep conditioners"
67,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,It’s not for me,"It came fast and as described but it’s just not for me. Smells awesome. It’s very thick, like a lotion and hard to get out of the bottle. It makes my hair look so greasy and wet, it also makes my hair very hard and crunchy. I have natural very curly thick hair."
68,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work for me,This product was waaayy too moisturizing and I have curl dryish hair so… it made my hair flat and just gross feeling. I tried using a small amount and still no luck. The leave in conditioner though slaps. Not this though.
69,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,love this stuff,I decided to let my nature curly hair shine and not straighten it and damage it. This stuff works great and it doesn't weigh down my curls and holds great without leaving your hair feeling crunchy. Buy this stuff all the time
70,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, impractical container",Would give it a five if the bottle wasn't so inconvenient. It's impractical to put such a thick substance in a bottle with such a small opening. It's a workout to try to get a good amount out per squeeze. Would be much better in a jar with screw on lid. Does dry on white if you apply too much.
71,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,I have about 5 of these hair products from this company and I use it  every day the scent is amazing great with my hair and really gives me a confident boost I also read a story of how they came from very intresting and unique Love this product !!
72,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The benefits WOW!,This stuff combined with the shampoo & conditioner is mind blowing. I can not sing the praises of Shea Moisture Curl products enough. The difference they have done on my hair. I will not use anything else ever again. What once was a rats nest is now a waterfall of soft maintained waves. Try it you’ll not regret it!
73,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Conditioner/Leave In,"This product is VERY thick coming out of the bottle.  I have to beat it out.  It does seem like it does a good job after I get it out.  I'm using it as a leave in AND as a deep conditioner.  I'm not sure I would buy again, although I do like their other prodcuts."
74,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Would Not Recommend nor Buy Again,"This product left my hair dry and flakey, even though it is a cream and not a gel. I am a black women and my natural texture is a 3C. I used this product on freshly washed and conditioned hair and still got horrible results. The shampoo and conditioner were Shea Moisture products and I used it for a second day hoping that the results would improve, but I was wrong. Would not recommend."
75,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Fix the bottle,"I love this product . Smells fantastic . Make my curls look great . I wish they world rethink the bottle . So hard to squeeze out . I have to uncap and shake product out , it’s kinda annoying . If you don’t care about fighting with the bottle some it’s a great product ."
76,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,A bit greasy,"I have thick (and a lot of it) but soft long wavy hair.Overall, I think it’s a good product but it wasn’t the right product for me. The texture was just a touch too greasy for me."
77,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,This is too thick and greasy.,"This stuff is way too thick and heavy for curly hair. The texture is just so heavy . I only used it once, I should have returned it, but it was too much a pain. The texture of the product is like a super heavy lotion… and drags down the curl and feels like you put crisco oil on your hair."
78,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves hair natural feeling,"For someone who has thick hair and has struggled for years trying to tame it without frizz, I FINALLY found a product that doesn't weigh it down or cause dryness.! Soooo happy with the way it makes my curls natural. I love the fact it's a leave in conditioner. Easy to apply where needed. Not heavy on scent."
79,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing but so small,I love this milk it works amazing for my hair. I have 3B-3C curls and this is the best but is sooooo small like I was so shocked when I got it like this doesn’t last long if you have a lot of hair but the product is amazing.
80,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t define for my hair,"The scent is great and it does moisturize my hair. The one thing I don’t like about the hair milk is that it doesn’t really define my hair. I have different hair types throughout my head. I have 3b, 4a, 4b hair types.  I notice a little bit of a difference, but not what I wanted. I use it like a leave-in cream now"
81,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,good but difficult to open,"i love shea moisture and this curl and style milk is great for styling hair, i usually water it down some bc it’s SUPER thick and difficult to get out the container. but i would definitely buy again!"
82,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Condioner,"The conditioner is great, but Way TOO THICK to come through the pump. It needs to have a regular cap. It's frustrating to get it out while your hands are wet and slippery.  That's my only complaint."
83,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"My hair is puffy, curly it would get dry and really really tangled. I been using this for a month now. Love it. One thing I love I can put this on and won't even have to comb my hair thru out the day and stay moisturize. Love it"
84,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not too happy,"Not satisfied . This product did not worked out for my type of hair. I have dry curly hair. Not the moisturizing effect I expected. Not a leave in conditioner, leaves my hair as if it needs to be washed again.."
85,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My fave,My go to styling product for years. I tried the curling smoothie but it was too heavy for my wavy hair (2b~3a) but this milk is light enough so that it has bounce and enough moisture.Package was intact. Happy with the delivery and handling of the product as well.
86,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,"Well, I been using this product for awhile and I am truly impressed that it does not make my hair feel ""crunchy"". It remains soft and manageable all day. This is my fourth time purchasing it but not from amazon. Going forward; I found it cheaper here so it a WIN-WIN for me."
87,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!!!,"I don't normally write reviews but I feel like this product deserves some credit. I have 3b curly hair and I always have trouble finding a good product for my hair. I took a chance on this item and OMG!! Its amazing!! First of all it smells really good like coconuts. The texture of it is smooth and creamy. It leaves my curls soft and beautiful! I noticed even after a couple of days of not washing my hair, my hair is still shiny and soft. I'm glad I decided to try this out."
88,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is amazing ! Love it ! Think you will too!,This smells sooo good! Keeps my curls defined without the gunky feeling that gels have! Very soft and conditioned as I have coarse curly red hair ! This is all I’ll be using from now on!!  Yahoo ... happy I discovered this and decided to get it ! :-)
89,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,5yrs Later I'm still a True Fan.,My first bottle Purchased was very thick I couldn't get it out. I did Try another bottle an it worked very well on my 3a 3b Natural hair. 5yrs later I'm still a True Fan.

93,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,TOO THICK,"While the fragrance of this is really good, I have yet to get any out of the bottle.  Far too thick and no way to get it out of the bottle.  I cannot recommend it since it is just too thick to get out of the bottle."
94,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,I love this product! I purchased this for my daughter who has thick curly hair.  Its amazing on her hair. I helps moisturize her curls while leaving a great smell and not too greasy!  Its my go to for styling her hair daily.
95,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Amazing But....,It smell amazing but after using for 3 time you need to open the containers lid because by squishing it it doesn't come out at all.
96,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy and hard,I tried this product because it was recommended by my sister in-law. I have curly hair that tends to get frizzy throughout the day. After I applied a dime size amount through my hair it became greasy and hard. I could barely run my hands through. Terrible. Mayb work for you but is a definite no for me.
97,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s okay,"It’s okay, it left a white residue in my hair but I tend to have a heavy hand when it comes to my products. Also it’s difficult to get out of the bottle because of the thicker consistency. I have 3b/c hair, There are better products out there for around the same price."
98,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"The scent is fine, not strong. This is my go to for a wash and go and it keeps my hair moistured. I feel like there's not enough product for the price."

It smelled like a coconut  pinacoloda, sweet. I didn't like it. The bottle was also incredibly hard to open, I squeezed so much it left a dent. This moisturizer is also very thick so you have to use a lot to get it on your hair. Wouldn't recommend it."
100,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Type hair,This product is a protein based moisturizer. If you are a 4c Type natural hair. I would not recommend using on a everyday basis but overall is a good product.

Pretty scary.

108,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Unable to use,Removed foil seal. Product was too thick to get out of bottle.  Even after squeezing and shaking.  It did have an awesome scent.  Don't know what was wrong.

113,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product!,"This product is great to apply after the shower to help make my hair super curly! I was expecting a more milky, liquid substance, but the product is actually quite thick and more like a hair lotion. I usually use a dollop of the curl milk, add some water in my hand, and apply it to my wet hair after a shower. That's my favorite way to use this product!"
114,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Scent is a little much, and it’s a little thick",Not for thin curly hair. It’s a little thick and leaves a residue if your hair isn’t thick enough to soak it all up. I don’t like the scent it’s too much.

116,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too Much product is needed for good results.,It smells nice. It feels light weight but too much product is needed to keep hair looking moist. My hair is naturally curly but can get dry out during the day. The curl definition is there but I mean if your hair is fully curly and your just looking for a product to keep your hair nicely moist then this product is not the best.

121,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Yucky residue!,Left a horrible residue on my hair after only one use. Had to wash my hair again after I got home from work. Scent was ok.
122,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ammm...,"Deja un olor agradable, pero al pasar el tiempo de aplicarlo da un aspecto reseco, casi lo mismo que usar gel estandar."
123,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult to get out of the bottle.,"I think the product is great, but it is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle. I am in the process of transferring it to a tub-like container so I can use it easier."
124,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too thick for my hair,"This is too thick for 3b or close to 3b hair. cant detangle with it or comb through easily. Great price, great scent but too greasy and thick. Definitely adds moisture though."
125,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy with it,"I hate to do this after a bought this product a few months back, but I got busy and forgot .What a mess it is to get it out of the container for starters. Secondly it just creates a grease layer on the hair but not sure it moisturizes it. I have to toss it because I cannot even get the product out of the bottle…thick and not fluid."
126,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,Highly recommend. Just wish it was easier to squeeze out lol.
127,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Nightmare,Absolutely hated it. It is thick as quicksand for one step. I leaves your hair white and sticky. It looked dirty. Really really dirty. I immediately washed it out and will never reuse. Definitely a waste of money.
128,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural curls all the way !,Great for natural curls. A little heavier then I’m use to but with trial and error ive worked out the right amount.

131,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good. But frizzy when dry,I feel that it is amazing while my hair is still wet however it still leaves my hair frizzy once it dries up.
132,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too thick to pour,"I have used this product many times in the past.  This is not like the curl and style ""milk"" that I used in the past. It was a good deal so I ordered 2 bottles. It is so thick that I can't even pour it from the bottle. So I hardly ever use it because of the struggle getting it out of the bottle. It smells great."
133,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love! Love!,This stuff is great! I can actually let my curly hair air dry without it looking like a frizzball!

141,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,It smells decent but I don't find any value in using it.
142,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Know if the lotion is thick or thin.,This product is too thick for my grade of hair. I wanted to try it due to the success I've had with the other products.
143,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me….,Not for my hair. Was too thick and the smell was unbearable.
144,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells terrible,"Idk what scent this is but all it smells like is chemicals and vile, leaves hair feeling gross and crispy kind of hard to wash off And leaves scalp extra dry and itchy"

This product is amazing!  A very small amount controls the frizz in my hair, which is about shoulder length, and defines the curl.  The smell is amazing.  It is a little heavier than I thought so use less than you think you need. It's kind of difficult to get the product out of the bottle because it is thick.  Overall, the best product I have ever used on my hair"

153,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Design flaw- waste of money,Brand new bottles and the product doesn’t dispense.

335,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When this first arrived, I immediately put a dime-sized amount into my dry hair. And I liked it--it seemed to work with the mousse I already had in my hair, didn't weigh it down too much, and seemed to revive the curl just a bit. Cool, I thought.Each time I've tried to use it, since then, I haven't been as delighted. I have applied it to wet hair after showering. It doesn't have enough ""hold"" to help my hair stay in curls when applied to wet hair. My course hair falls barely wavy without product but with mousse or gel it holds up to a ringlet-like twist. A #1/flexible hold product like Aussie Sprunch Mousse and Leave-in Conditioner generally results in curls for me, even after sleeping on it for the night, but not this styling milk. I think it's more appropriate for hair that holds curls on its own rather than needs some ""help"" to get there. For my hair, this product is best used *sparingly.*When applied to wet hair in greater amounts (less than I use of gel, but more than just one dime) my hair feels yucky until I wash it next. It is stiff like hair that is saturated in oils and hasn't been washed for a long time, not stiff like crunchy. Applied heavily like a gel it's yuck, applied sparingly like a smoothing balm it's OK.It definitely has anti-frizz results for me, at least while it's applied. I haven't noticed an overall frizz reduction over time if I don't apply the styling milk.I don't really like the scent, but my guess is it's the neem oil so ""to be expected"" from any product containing neem oil. It's not a perfumey scent at all.To compare to some other Shea Moisture products that you might debate between, I also use (not at the same time as the styling milk) Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Finishing Oil Serum, which gives more *shine* than this styling milk, but not quite as much de-frizzing unless I use too much oil but that just looks greasy. I also like the 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Styling Gel, which does have a crunch (despite its claims) but better hold after scrunching the crunch than this styling milk while still doing a decent amount of smoothing/frizz-prevention.For curlier hair than mine, I'd suggest more toward the styling milk or the oil serum for smoothing or shine, respectively, but for not super curly hair types like mine, the milk probably isn't the best of the Shea Moisture choices."
336,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son's long 3a/3b curls are just awesome, but his low porosity hair makes upkeep a disaster.  However, when I used the SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Style Milk, 8 Fluid Ounce on his curls, an entire week went by with absolutely gorgeous curls that were definitely hot n' poppin'!  After doing our usual wash day routine using the entire SheaMoisture Low Porosity line.  (Shampoo, Conditioner, and Manuka Honey Deep Conditioner).  I then detangled using the SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Leave-In Treatment.  Lastly, I detangled more using this Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Style Milk.  I then sealed a little bit with SheaMoisture FlaxSeed Oil and Argan Oil.  (I'm really not an exclusively SheaMoisture girl, it just worked out that way that day)AN ENTIRE WEEK!!  An entire week went by with detangled, moisture locked in curls.  The frizzies stayed away until the end of the week.  Plus, detangling on his tenderhead was so much easier!  So, for him, this was a godsend.  I haven't tried it on my 4C low porosity hair, but I will bet it will not work since nothing works on 4C hair.  However, for my son, I can't be more happy.Now, at $16 a bottle!  Yeah, no.  I've never paid more than $12 from anything SheaMoisture.  So, when this bottle runs out, I'm going to have to think long and hard about whether I want to continue with this product.  Also, the bottle really isn't conducive to allowing the product to come out.  I have to take the cap off and shake it out onto my hand.  So, this product is great for 3a/3b folks, but at $16 for 8oz. I would be trying to find something else, which is a shame because SheaMoisture typically has really great products at decent prices."
337,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I had started using this 30 years ago. I've got 2C-3C typish hair, I think. If it's short, it's in natural ringlets. Anyhow. This product smells delicious, makes your hair look so shiny & so healthy. It glides thru your damp hair & defines your curls with absolutely NO crunch. None. Amazing! I'm in love. I shall not use any other hair product for my curls again. Thats a promise. Thank you so much Sheamoisture!!✔ Yes, I recommend this product."
338,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not a fan of this product. It smells great, but that’s pretty much where the positives end for me. First off, it’s really hard to squeeze out of the bottle. Either the packaging is poor, or the cream is too thick, or a combination of both. That’s the least of the problems though. The first time I used it, my hair felt gross, especially up by my scalp. Kind of a greasy, sticky feeling, like I’d run a bunch of pomade through my hair. It did a good job holding the curl and the volume though. So the next time I used a lot less, concentrating on the ends, and avoiding the scalp area completely. My curls aren’t holding as well, but my scalp are STILL feels gross.There are plenty of curl products out there, and without the trade off of having untouchable, gross feeling hair. Perhaps people with a different curl texture would have better success (I’m about a 3A), but this product isn’t for me."
339,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 50 REVIEWER,"I'm a HUGE fan of Shea Moisture products. They really deliver on the moisture. I tried this product a while ago and didn't like it. I decided to try again using a new methodology because I kept hearing good things about it. I would suggest applying this product to wet hair. The first time I used it, it flaked up as it dried. I'm pretty sure it was because I used too much and my hair wasn't wet enough. I got much better results this time. My hair was soft and defined, though not nearly as much as with gel. The scent might be a little much for some, but I like it. I can now confidently recommend this product.Thanks so much for reading this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
340,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult bottle,"This is a decent leave-in conditioner.  It is not as great at reducing frizz as I had hoped.  The packaging also leaves something to be desired.  First, the formula: this leave-in is stiffer than I was expecting (which I actually like) and it is one of those products where you need to use less than you think.  It disperses out through the hair, and combs through easily.  It has definite leave-in conditioner effects, leaving my hair softer and more comb-able after washing.  The scent is quite nice- mostly coconut, tropical, and slightly milky.  In terms of frizz control, I have definitely used better products than this.  My hair is wavy, and it has a strong tendency to frizz out into a mess.  This product did not do all that much to control my frizz.  I've found other things to be more effective.  Finally, the big issue I have with this is that it is very difficult to get out of the bottle.  It comes in a standard shampoo bottle, but it's way too thick to come effectively down the bottle and out the hole.  After a shower, when your hand and bathroom are wet and steamy, getting this out of the bottle is quite a chore. I don't want to have to allocate extra time in my morning routine to shaking and cajoling my hair products out of a bottle.  For that reason, I would not repurchase this."
341,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Not that impressed with this shea moisture product. I have used several of their products for about 5 years now, but have not tried this specific one. I mainly have used their jarred leave in products. This product was pretty thick so a little bit difficult to dispense. It smells pretty good. I didnt like the way it made my hair feel though and I'm pretty sure it made my dandruff worse. I dont even use the product on my scalp but noticed that it seemed worse after using it. I have naturally thick, curly, and frizzy hair and this didnt seem to help with my hair. It was worth a shot but I dont think I'd use this specific product again."
342,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like coconut but the smell in this reminds me of Banana Boat sun oil from years ago. Everyone at the pool and the beach smelled coconutty. As I got older and started using more natural items - of which coconut oil is generally present, the smell is not too much after a few minutes. I put some on my hair with a bit of water and brushed through the curls and I didn't get one tangle. I always have to leave conditioner on my hair after I shampoo and rinse so that I can brush through or comb through my long hair. This works well. It is also cost effective because it requires a small amount."
343,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I'm surprised at how much I love this! I have hair that is wavy, not necessarily curly, but definitely a thick bodied wave. I often wear my hair in a braid so I don't usually use styling products too much, just a teeny bit to keep my flyaway's under control.In the interests of testing this is thoroughly a somebody else would, I combed a good-sized job through all of my hair rather than just in a couple areas where I usually need a little more control, and it didn't act like a styling product to me so much is just a deeper leave in conditioner that helped my hair kind of stay well-behaved. I didn't notice any residue that I found uncomfortable or unattractive, just nicer hair.And I really appreciated how delightful and yet subtle the fragrance was. There's just enough fragrance that I feel I'm using an exciting and luxurious product without so much that it disagrees with me or makes me sneeze. It smells like coconuts and like a tropical flower.Overall I would really recommend this for people who have wavy hair or thick hair of any texture."
344,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This reminds me of oiling up everything with coconut oil and then getting into a box lined with aluminum foil in the 80s, when we used to work on our tans by burning the living daylights out of our skin.  The smell though!  The Hawai'ian Tropics scent, the coconut!  This smells like THAT and THAT was wonderful.Yes, I know it was a bad idea.  But it smelled so great!It left my hair feeling all rich and thick and coconutty."
345,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The first time I used this, I squirted a healthy pile into my palm, about the amount I would do for conditioner. It was laborious—the bottle is not designed to squeeze (and it loses a star for it). It smelled great, and my hair felt wonderful... for the day. When I brushed it out that night, though, it was sticky and I ended up washing it a day or two later because I couldn’t stand it. It wasn’t greasy, it just was kind of sticky and hard to brush (easy to put up in a bun though!!). Darn.The second time I used it, I squirted a dainty amount on my palm. Let’s say the size of a quarter. My hair liked it. I scrunched my hair a little bit and it didn’t seem like enough. However, my hair remained curly throughout the day (which to be fair it does anyway when I air dry it), and was luxurious thereafter.The lesson? Don't use too much and it’s dandy."
346,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have thick curly hair with an oily scalp. It is very hard for me to find products that will moisturize my hair without leaving it limp and oily looking. Well this SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Style Milk has been heaven sent! The scent is truly amazing. The coconut scent is tempered by the slight floral aroma of the hibiscus. After applying to my damp hair, I smell the fragrance for days. People at work continue to complement my hair and the scent. My husband loves the smell as well, and this is rare for a man. I have completely stopped using moose or gel in my hair. This product helps to hold my curl. When my hair is completely dry I apply hairspray, but that has been all I needed. My frizz is gone completely, and I am left with soft and defined curls. I love this product!"
347,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a leave in conditioner which for me are not ideal.  I already have oily hair so these leave install don't work well for me.  My wife has dry hair and likes this a lot.  She isn't thrilled with the scent (to coconut smelling) but says it dissipated quick enough.  Helps control split ends and the frizzies.  My wife says this is one of the better keave instead she has used.  I tried it once and had to wash it out as I did not like how it left my hair.
348,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,From bouncy light curls to heavy oily waves,"Leaves my hair kind of oily and heavy no matter how long I rinse out the conditioner. I dont mean just the scalp, I mean like half way down the shaft. My sister has struggled with dry hair and while it was nice to see hair moisturized, it was starting to also give her hair an oily effect. Maybe this is a sign of healthier hair?I also noticed my hair doesnt hold curls very well after switching to this conditioner. Even after washing and rinsing hair thoroughly, it still feels like product stays in my hair and weighs it down. As a result, my hair is more heavy and wavy rather than having lightweight, bouncy curls."
349,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The styling milk is really hard to get out of the bottle. It has that tiny push top opening, but it does nothing. I had to unscrew the cap and shake the bottle until stuff would come out, because it is so thick. THey should have made the bottle from softer plastic, I guess, so we could actually squeeze it.The milk does smell nice, and it has light hold. It did not weigh my hair down. But it made my scalp itchy and the hair looked oily quite too soon. I do not think I will bother with it again"
350,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Oily feel but great curls,I'm on the fence with this. I love the way it smells and the way my curls feel perky and in shape after I use it.But then. Then it happens. The curls remain but this sense of oil and dirty hair. Second or third day hair. That's what happens.  After about an hour it really feels annoying and I even checked to see if I had residue on my blouse from it (there wasn't).I'm not sure what I'll do when this runs out. I will finish it but will update if I decide to purchase.
351,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Nearly Impossible to Use,"I think the product itself is good, I enjoy how my hair looks with it, but my hair has to be darn near soaking wet for it to distribute somewhat evenly. The biggest flaw is I need my 6’2 boyfriend to squeeze any out of the bottle. It is almost impossible to get any product out of the bottle it’s literally stuck in there and SO THICK. I stored upside down and nothing! How is this marketed as a “milk”??"
352,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells wonderful,I’m a fan of this! It is very easy to use and gives my hair a lot of extra moisture and shine.  It doesn’t make my hair feel crunchy at all.  I usually apply it when my hair is wet and work it through the ends.  It doesn’t take much product to get the job done even though I have a lot of hair.This smells amazing and I would continue to use it just for the smell alone!
353,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Buy with caution - formula has changed for the worst :(,"They must have changed the formula! This product was literally perfect for years and years. This recent bottle was very different. The product is so thick that I couldn't even get it out of the bottle. When I finally got a little amount out, it had no slip and felt like I was putting sticky hand lotion in my hair. I ended up trying to recycle the bottle and the toss the rest of the product - but even the bottle was impossible to get clean. Very sad."
354,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy!,"Left my hair feeling greasy, not moisturized, yet somehow still frizzy. Def a heavy product. I want curls that are soft enough I can run my fingers through, but this just made my hair stringy and knotted. This isn’t the one for me, so the search continues! Gave one star for the pleasing scent and one star for value."
355,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We always look for the best for our health and that includes our hair. That is why this humectant without sulfates, without parabens, without phthalates, without propylene glycol, without mineral oil, without tests with animals and without oil is what we need. Its delicious scent of coconut invites you but that yes, it is not cloying that you feel that you have fruits on your head and everyone persists your coconut smell. I like your result and I recommend it."
356,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Too Much for My Hair - Best for Curly, Dry Hair","A little goes a long way…..  Even with a small amount, this weighs down my hair.  I have naturally wavy hair, healthy & an oily scalp.  I think this is best for very curly or dry hair.  It would also be good to slather on at the beach – which is how I will use it.  It will protect my hair, allow me to comb it out & it smells like beachy coconut."
357,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have naturally wavy hair which I routinely color, and it's also rather thick, so I appreciate a moisturizing curl product. This one smelled fine to me, but was just too thick and left my hair looking really dirty and oily. Even when I used a LOT less (so much less I wasn't sure it would even work at all), my hair still looked terrible. It was bad enough that I washed it again the same day! Bummed it didn't work out for me."
358,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wrong Consistency,The product was not soft or easy to come out of the bottle.  I expected it to be the consistency of a lotion instead it was like cream.  That would have been ok if it was not in a bottle.  It is useless since I can't get it out of the bottle.
359,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is really thick, and I love the scent.  Unfortunately, even mixing this 50/50 with water, it makes my hair look so greasy that it looks and feels dirty an hour after I've used it.  I have dry hair, and this is the first leave-in that has done that to me.  I can't recommend it."
360,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have,"My hair is curly, fine and dry. I use the Diva line for my shampoo, conditioner and gel. This is the last product I put on my wet hair, to stop the frizzies and to moisturize the ends. It works well with the gel to lock in the moist curls, and it smells so good.  Someone at Target told me about this product when we were shopping in the curly hair section. I fell in love with it instantly and will never use anything else."
361,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but the bottle is too hard to squeeze,This really helped my newly acquired chemo curls come to life. But am unsure if I would purchase this again as it is a struggle to squeeze the product out. If I wack the bottom with the cover off...too much comes out and is almost impossible to put back. Did anyone even try this prior to marketing?
362,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works,"This stuff smells great, looks like hair lotion, and moisturizes your curls all day.

380,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have 2C, naturally platinum blonde hair, wasnt as expected","I have very long, layered, thick wavy/curly hair that is naturally very blonde with some strawberry highlights. I swim almost daily which is difficult to keep hair manageable being washed this often. I was looking for a styling product I could brush through the hair when damp so it would air dry to the locks I desire without frizz.First, when I read 'milk' I thought it was a much thinner product... This is in a bottle- but definitely more of a paste. Difficult to get out with wet hands or if you had arthritis. In that same respect I used about 1 tablespoon total- with not enough reduction of frizz (especially in the back- where I wanted it) and found it heavy in the front (where I like it to 'flow' more?... this might make sense to those of us with this hair type). The smell is great however so I will use it up, but be seeking something more of a 'leave-in conditioner' type for my hair so I have more liberating control."
381,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for frizzy hair.,"I am of Hispanic and French nationality.  I have naturally curly hair and with that comes dryness.  This product is great at keeping the frizz down and giving my hair moisture.  The only bad thing about this product is it is super thick and very hard to squeeze out of the bottle (it's the product itself, not a seller issue)."
382,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"Okay I was super skeptical but it works great! Smells great, gets curls, helps w h my frizzy hair! There is one thing you need to know, if you use a lot of conditioner and then this product your hair will be very oily. So wash it with shampoo after and then do the product."
383,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Only Thing I Like is the Scent,"I have 3C curly hair.  My mother is a registered cosmetologist and has access to all types of hair products.  I was looking for something to use and came across this ""Style Milk"".  First thing that I noticed is how difficult it is to get the product out of the bottle.  Once in my hand, it is not creamy or smooth at all.  It has a weird texture and just sits on my hair until I comb or rub through it.  The smell is delicious, and it does not leave my hair crunchy, however it doesn't work with my hair."
384,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful product!,"As some others have noted when I used a lot, my hair got crunchy and sticky. I have 2B/2C hair that’s pretty dry and coarse, past my shoulders. Now that I use about a penny sized squirt it’s magic! It holds waves together well."
385,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"My daughter, who is 6, has extremely thick, curly, dry and frizzy hair. Her hair type is 3B. I have been searching for decent products that actually do what they are supposed to and don't break the bank. This is it! It moisturizes and keeps her hair soft. I do use a combo of other products, but with this being a part of our regimen, we are no longer dealing with frizz! So thankful I found this product."
386,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not my cup of tea,"So, I use Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner and thought I'd give this a try to help tame my curly hair. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed as it made my hair feel a little greasy and heavy. Not sure if I put too much in or what...but will probably not use. It does have a nice scent though."

413,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Shea Moisture is family owned and its legacy dates back to 1912.  The Coconut and Hibiscus curl and style milk is very thick and heavily coats my hair.  I have thick hair that is wavy to curly. I style with heat and also set my hair for no heat curls or waves.  The Shea Moisture may be too thick for some but it is very hydrating. It can and will leave a texture depending on the application. I could see how rich and nourishing this formula was the first day I used it.  I have used it for a month regularly and liberally and I still have well over half of the bottle left.  I put a little in my hands and rub them together.  Then I wet my hands and put them through my wet hair.  This makes it a little more diluted and gets through my hair.  This has worked in any way that I have styled my hair.  It smells like coconuts and it lasts.  It contains coconut oil, vegetable glycerin, soybean oil, carrot root extract, shea, silk, and more.  If you know how to work with a heavier cream and are looking for something nourishing, this will work well."
414,"SheaMoisture Curl and Style Milk for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus for Curl Definition 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for curly waves. <3,I have really thick and naturally curly/wavy hair so I was trying to find something that would make them stand out more and I found this as a suggestion on a beauty site and B O I is this it. They're definitely sticking out now! I tried Cantu but it just made my curls too tight. This one did the job. I followed the instructions and left my hair damp before putting it on (towel dried most of the moisture). It's kind of hard to squeeze out of the bottle. But that's the only issue I have with the product.

Después de usarlo puedes utilizar toda la línea de Shea moisture sin tener inconvenientes, y de verdad vale el precio y queda perfecto.

   This seems like it’s been tampered with or something , my boyfriend has been using this for months now and we always buy it from target never online , I purchased this online and it’s nothing like the store bought one although their “exactly” the “same”"

The consistency of this gel has completed changed and was very difficult to work with. I don't know if I received a bad batch or that they changed the product but I was so disappointed.

Usually, this product should be a runny, batter like texture, but when I opened this gel it was SOLID LIKE JELLO. I tried rubbing it in my hands and it  just crumbled. I really like shea moisture products, but I might take a break from them for a while. The gel is unusable and I'm very disappointed and will now have dry hair since I have to wait for another product to ship."

   This product is absolutely horrible. I’ve used the Gel Soufflé for years, then suddenly a few months ago I wasn’t able to find it in the stores anymore. I finally decided to just order it, and there’s a good reason why it’s off the shelves. It’s between the texture of jello and ballistic gelatin. It doesn’t dissolve in your hair, it’s clunky if you even try to rub a quarter size amount in your palms just to apply to your hair. I never hated a product from Shea Moisture in life, until I tried the Gel Soufflé. This is not the Soufflé of the past, the company was sneaky and changed the formula. The first 4 formulas are cheap fillers: Glycerin (Vegtable); Water; Corn Syrup; Pectin.I am not at all pleased. I tried to like it, but my hair said otherwise. The Soufflé left a strange film on the top of hair. I have very curly thick hair, and I live in the dry climate of North East Colorado. The previous Soufflé was great in helping my hair retain moisture. The new Soufflé is the complete opposite. I’m beyond disappointed."
10,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bad batch,"I have used this product for years and I typically go into the local pharmacy and pick up a jar but I decided this time to get one from Amazon. When it arrived it was hard, so I had to put it in the microwave to thaw it out to make it loose and overnight it harden back up again. I've never experienced this before with this product. This product is great for my hair. I have 4C type of hair but for some reason when I ordered it from Amazon it came in hard as a rock so that's why I only gave it three stars. Typically I would have gave it five stars but I am not sure if this product was part of bad batch or what but I will reach to Amazon about it. I received my replacement order today (8/7/2020). Same issue. I will buy from the pharmacy from here on out."
11,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this gel and this brand!,"For decades I used a spritz hair sprays that I bought at the local store. They would always leave my head itching and on fire, but then my daughter introduced me to this gel and I will never buy anything else for my hair! My hair actually goes all the way down to my lower back area and no longer is it fuzzy on the ends and split. It makes my hair stay looking natural and alive not dead. The coconut smells amazing too!  I’ve actually had people ask me what perfume or body spray I’m using and they are super surprised when I tell them that it’s my hair gel. LOL"
12,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"So the product is extremely thick you can flip the jar upside down and it will not fall out, it reminds me of coconut oil consistency you have to warm it up in your palms before putting in your hair, it is not moisturizing at all it makes my hair look oily and piecey not clumpy at all. I have 3a-3b thin hair curly. I believe this product is better for girls with 4a-4c hair we’re oils products work best. I prefer gels and this is not a gel, they should change the name."

I don't know why people were saying that it is like a solid, because mine was very much like how normal gel is! I think that they fixed whatever was wrong with it.Overall:Smell: OH.MY.GOD. BEST SMELL EVER!!! Paired with the SheaMoisture coconut and hibiscus curl shampoo and conditioner, this product makes my hair smell so amazing!Moisturizing: Normally my hair is really dry, but using this it was so much better, and moist, but not too moist that it's oily.Overall, I'd REALLY recommend this product to anyone with curly/wavy hair!!!! SheaMoisture is still my favorite curly-girl brand!"
14,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not The Same,"When I first used this product in 2019, it was a viscous liquid. I stopped using it almost immediately since it took nearly all day to dry.I decided to give it another shot and ordered a jar. Like many others, I got a solid, translucent block of stiff gelatin, totally unusable as it couldn't be spread in my hair. I cut up the block and ran it through the blender, rendering the product to that spreadable liquid I remember. However, a day later, it's thickening and resolidifying. If I will need to use the blender every few days, I'll be sending this poorly reformulated goop back for a refund."

It is very stiff like too hard jello.  I tried several times ( once isn't enough ) to scoop some out of the jar and squish it in my palms.  I hoped the heat from my palms would soften it...It did not soften and just got broken up into little gobs.  I am stubborn and tried to get it in my hair....globs fell to the floor.

   Don't know what happened but went to use this and it was semi-solid and unusable.  Was more like super hard jello than anything I could put in my hair.  I did try to put some in my hand and it crumbled into little pieces.  I'm sure this jar is an outlier and have asked for a replacement.  Finger-crossed it isn't like this one.UPDATE: Received second jar and it's the same.  I went to Shea's website and discovered a number of customers writing in with the same problem.  So Shea itself is aware they have a defective product on the market.  Definitely wouldn't buy until someone at Shea can assure the problem has been fixed and bad product off shelves (though that may be difficult with Amazon sellers) The number for Shea Moisture Customer Service is 1-866-478-1925"

You could not warm it up in your hands. It was so hard I actually put it in the microwave so I could use it. I was doing my hair, so I had to make it work. I'm really disappointed as an Amazon customer I put faith in the fact that I am buying from honest seller and clearly this was not the case."
18,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality control= poor consistency,"I have used this product for a while now but this is the second time I have ordered and the consistency of the gel was so hard that it would be in chunks in my hair, on the floor, the counter everywhere. Last time I ordered I ended up putting it in my Vitamix with a little water, which was better but not ideal. I wrote to the company but never really got any action from them other than a form to fill out with info I had already given them when I made contact. This time I ordered hoping the previous order was just a bad batch. It came the exact same way hard and chunky. I used my immersion blender with no water and got way better consistency and results. It’s just kind of a pain to have to go through that."

When scooped out an placed in the palm of my hand the ""shuffle"" crumbled like cookie crumbs. Was expecting a smooth creamy texture.  So disappointed.  Would not recommend."
20,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this product, but...","I have been using this gel for the past five years so I ignored the negative reviews about the texture of the product. I wish I would have listened. The product that arrived was absolutely nothing like what I usually pick up at my local store. I ordered online for convenience, but had to go back to the store to get the product I know and love.The texture of the gel was clumpy (almost dry?!?) and impossible to evenly work through my hair. When I buy from the store it is usually thick, but usable. Over the years I have noticed differences in the texture of the product, but never anything to this extreme. Save yourself the time and money - definitely give this gel a try, but do not order online."

However, this order was just awful. When I got the product It was super runny. Like fluid. There was no viscosity to it at all. But I know this product is supposed to be thicker. I saw other reviews of people getting like bricks. But I was the complete opposite. I’m not sure what’s going on with this brand lately. I did go into a store and saw a container that had the proper thickness so I know they’re at least making it right now. It was just unfortunate that my order was wrong."
22,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Unusable due to consistency,"Product is unusable due to the hard jello consistency. Crumbles, does not become spreadable or liquid enough to apply to hair at all. Theory: A third party seller found these on clearance at some point and is reselling them on Amazon. Problem is, they were probably on clearance because they had been stored incorrectly, chsnging the composition of the product. I have never bought this product direct from a retailer like Target so I don't know what it is typically like, but like other reviewers, I was not able to use this product as received through Amazon."

I have been using this for years and what is being sold is beyond horrible!  This is not a gel.  This is not a soufflé!  It is solid and when you DIG into it, it crumbles into chunks!  I tried working and I do mean working, it in my palms, and it is useless for the hair.  When you put the clumps in your hair, you have to rub it in your hair for too long and it does not come close to the old formula.  I am sending back to Amazon, 6 jars!  This is a shame!  Oh well, we have to hunt for another product!  UGH!"
24,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a product issue,I have purchased this from the store before and had no issues but this jar was not right. It's a hard glob of mess that I really can't use. I'm not sure if where it was stored might've caused the glycerin to harden or what. I unfortunately have moved to an area where ethnic products are either limited or non existent so that's why I ordered this thru Amazon. It was a waste of money.
25,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Solid gel,I have used this product many times and it works great on my hair adding a more definitive hold to my curls AAAAAAND it has always been a smooth gel.

26,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,I received this product in the mail today and the product itself is so hard and stuck together like play-duh. When I tried to dig a piece out the jar it will not breakup or loosen when you rub it between the palm of your hands. I must have gotten a bad batch because this product is not usable. It is no good. Absolute waste money.

I’m not sure why. In store the product is kind of snotty and sticky, which works well for me to distribute through my hair and hold a curl. I get that that might be off putting for some, so maybe that’s why they’re changing the formula? The stuff I ordered from Amazon has the consistency of jello. You have to dig out a chunk and smoosh it into your hair and overall it just doesn’t preform as well as the old formula. Idk why it’s different, but I’ll stick to buying it from Walmart as long as it stays the snotty sticky formula I like."

   What a waste of money! I bought this for the curly girl method. It is a solid, gelatinous block. I know that sounds like an oxymoron but I don’t know how else to describe this!

It was totally different and not good at all. I cannot get it to not be solid. Usually with this product I can take a little bit of the solid and rub it in my hands and it becomes a liquid and then I can put it in my hair. The one I bought through Amazon just continues to stay solid so I can’t really put it in my hair. Is someone making a fake knock-off of this product?

I had to stir it up and have to warm I’m my hands to get rid of the chunks.It does require scrunching after it dries to make my hair appear soft but that is not that unusual.Not sure if the texture is to be expected or if I just received an old container of product.

When I opened this it was solid rather than slick. I tried to use it and it dried sticky and greasy. I'm super disappointed because it was my back up from the last one (I bought in target) and I didn't open for a month after I bought it, so now I don't even have the option to return.

However, when I received this jar the consistency was very firm and not as liquid as those previously purchased.  i am not sure if this due to perhaps this a bad batch or if this was a very old jar..  Either way, I love the Shea Moisture Souffle and will hopefully not receive another jar is this condition.  I was firm, moreso than the somewhat jelly like consistency....very hard (I had to microwave it just to get it in a more liquid form)will not order it again from this seller."

EITHER DEFECTIVE (both ones I received) OR COUNTERFEIT PRODUCT.,Buyer beware. This must be a counterfeit product bc it is not correct. It’s a solid block not a gel. I’ve used this before and it’s supposed to be an actual gel. This is not useable at all. If I could give zero stars I would. I tried getting a replacement in the hopes that what I first received was a fluke but they are the same.  Don’t waste your money. Go buy at a store instead.

79,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy,Horrible product. It was so hard and not like advertised. Must be a new formula or the one I received must have been very very old.

I think the seller held onto it too long or left it in the heat. This is the 2nd time this has happened. I will purchase at the store from now on to make sure it's actually fresh.
97,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Formula change or bad batch,I've been using this product for the past few years.

236,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually like SheaMoisture products, but I'm not quite sure what to make of the SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Gel Souffle Styler, 12 Ounce.  It smells great, but when I went to get some out of the jar, my finger sprung back up like it hit a tiny trampoline!  Again and again my fingers bounced around without making a dent in the gel.  I had to dig in and I brought up chunks of what looked like the clear gummy bears.  The gel would not break down and when I put it on my son's hair at the end of his hair care routine, the chunks of gel were clearly in his hair.  I even had chunks of gel fall onto the couch.  The most bizarre product.  I am not sure if it's supposed to be like this or not.  However, I would say that my son's hair was actually better off without this product than with it.  At almost $18, I don't really see the value in this particular product."
237,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,How I use this product... If anyone cares 😉 3b/3c curly girl.,"I love this product. Yes, it has a weird gelatin consistency but you have to play with it to make it work. You have to figure out how much and how to apply. I have thick fine and coarse (due to the quantity of hair) 3b and 3c hair. What works for me is applying after towel drying and after applying a leave-in conditioner (same brand and scent). Then I separate my hair by sections, I apply a small amount. TO APPLY: take a SMALL amount onto your hands and rub it with the palm of your hands. This will change the texture and make it more pliable to add to your hair. This stuff becomes super oily yet thick feeling goo. So do not add it to the scalp. I personally apply it close to the scalp, but not on the scalp, to the ends, and work with a Denman 7 brush. Apply and brush by section after applying. It is super moisturizing with a light hold but really you have to give this product a chance. If your hair does not need extra moisture this stuff is not for you. But if you are like me and your hair sucks up moisture this stuff is awesome with a light hold."
238,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really liked this product.  I have other products from this line, but haven't tried this souffle until now. It is really nice. I don't agree with the other review that it is just for ethnic hair. I have wavy hair, and it was nice and made my hair fluffy. Fluffier than it has ever been on cgm. So it is a little oily, and has a thick slip like texture. I scooped a little, and let it melt between my palms and applied it to my hair. I also used it on wet hair after my shower. It kept my waves nice, and together. I will include a pic of my hair before I broke my cast. It is also nice for piecing on dry curls. I use it to style my son's super curly hair.Edited: It is AMAZING! I have now been using this product for two or three weeks, and have had a perfect hair day every day since. My wash days are the bomb. I also use the shea moisture curling cream, and them I apply this on after. Don't be afraid of the jelly like texture. Just scoop a little into your palms and melt it between them a little. It has helped keep my curls together and soft too! If I want an extra hard cast I use a curling mousse too. Otherwise it keeps my curls manageable and soft, but my clumps and coils stay!I definitely recommend.  You just have to play around with it. Not too much, and I use it on wet hair. I've refreshed with a tiny bit of it, and water too. I get tighter waves/curlies!"
239,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My Fav Wavy Hair Product!,I love Shea Moisture products. They revived my hair after brutal hair loss after having my sons. I had over a year of lots of chunks of hair falling out. In my personal experience I had to play with which ones worked best for me. For example I cannot use the whole coconut set because one of them or the combination of the make my hair fall out but if I use this and the conditioner with the black Castor oil shampoo 🧴 and that combination worked perfect for me. My hair got stronger and it stopped falling out. It’s started growing healthy again. I started rice water rinses and following the Curly Girl Method and boom. Back to normal. This product just a little goes a long way. I have thin wavy/curly hair. It works for my husband and two sons as well. They have thicker curly hair. It’s a great product.
240,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,What happens when a bigger company takes over?,"The Black women know what they're talking about! When we used to get this product, it was the consistency of an older product called Dippity Do; you didn't have to rub your hands together, get spoons to break up the globs so you could rub your hands together. This is result of the product being on shelves too long and drying out. We want to support OUR OWN but there's an entity -Unilever- that is banking on us to be loyal to a brand with hard earned money and a lackluster product and performance. I would rather cut off my hair (think Symone Sanders or Tiffany Hadish) than spend a penny on what doesn't work."
241,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Formula changed this is garbage now!,This product turned to crap real fast! This is not the texture or what this is supposed to be like at all. I've used this product for years and this is the 1st one that came as a hard jello lump inside. You cant even mix it up because it breaks into smaller tiny chunks that you could never put in your hair. I bought this at a store so this must be the new formula. I contacted the company waiting to hear back. I can never use this product again what a disappointment I will have to find another brand don't waste your money this is a nightmare.
242,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Use very sparingly and it works wonders on frizz!,"This was sticky the first couple of times I used it because I'm not used to using so little of a product. Whether I apply it to wet or dry hair, though, this is AMAZING for the frizz many of us deal with in the South.  It is a great product for defining curl and keeping it through the day. I've never used a product this consistency before, (a little softer than gelatin but stiffer than most hair gel).It takes less than a dime size amount to do my long hair, so even though the jar is a little expensive, it will easily last for more than a year. I just get the smallest dab, rub it between my hands, and run it through my hair from bottom to top (yes, in reverse so you don't get too much product on top.) It keeps my style all day.  I would highly recommend (and I do see a lot of vine reviews on here, but don't discount them, because most of us take our job as Vine reviewers very seriously and only write very honest reviews.) If you haven't found a product that works yet for your frizz yet, this is well worth trying."
243,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have straight hair and most curling gels can keep my hair curled. Most of the time it's very hard to keep curl in my hair but when I use a curling gel it hold longer. This did not work for me. This pulled the curls out as I ran my fingers through. However, when I used it on wet hair and dried it, it worked okay. I also didn't like the texture of this gel. It reminds me of the ""Gorilla Booger Gel"" you can get for your kids at a pharmacy. It feels like boogers. However, if you rub it in your hands to warm it up a bit, it will become a normal gel texture. I do believe this will work great for those that have frizzy, curling hair that you want to tame. It took my artificial curl out and also controlled the frizz. If you have wavy or semi curls, it may work for you. However, I think it would be best for those really curly girls that need help taming them. I would not recommend this for straight hair girls, but would for curly/frizzy hair girls. Just remember to warm it up in your hands before using."

I am satisfied with this Shea Moisture curl product.Although it made my hair a bit crunchy (which I do not love), my curls were definitely more controlled than normal, and they held all day long. I have to fight less in the morning to make them lay nicely.I put it on each night after showering, then let my hair air dry. It's definitely a bit oily, so wash up well after use. It also has a very unique texture to it, which took some getting used to. It did not make my head feel heavy, though.I also love that Shea Moisture uses more natural ingredients, including no sulfates. They have won the trust of my family for many years, so I am excited to introduce another product from the company into my routine!"
245,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Really?,"Sheamoisture what gives?  The old formula (Glycerin, water, Corn Syrup, Pectin, sheabutter, etc..) would moisturize  the hair for at least 5 days if you needed it to. The trick was to use on wet hair in the shower. No stickiness, just soft hair.  The new formula (Glycerin, water, Corn starch,propanediol, sheabutter... ect.) , you get moisture for  maybe 1 day and not that well.  Hair feels coated but not soft.  The old formula was the only thing from Sheamoisture that I  could tolerate."

Since it’s natural the consistency can be tricky , I just left it in a hot place for a day or so , and it melted like an oily gel.  I put a quarter sized shape and scrub it in my hands until it melts like oil , and then put it in my hair. It leaves a natural shine , it restores hair over time, tames frizz, prevents breakage , moisturizes while styling the hair. I love it! I use it with the other Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus products."

It keeps her hair hydrated, soft, and smelling so great. This gel souffle is one of the few products in the line we hadn't tried yet and now that we have, we aren't disappointed. This gel souffle keeps her curls in ringlets and reduces frizz throughout the day without being crunchy, stiff, or sticky like other gels. I'm super pleased with it. Also, the price of shea moisture products are reasonably affordable compared to other curly hair brands so that's a plus."
248,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use most of the products from the SheaMoisture line. This was a nice addition. I don't normally wear my hair curly, but sometimes I air dry it and let my natural curls have their way. This helps keep them from looking and feeling dry and brittle. It smells wonderful and it doesn't leave a flaky residue if I don't wet my hair again the next day. If you have curly hair, I would definitely have this available on my vanity."
249,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This product smells nice, but man is it gross feeling! It’s kind of jell-o like but stiffer. The best way to use it is take a scoop and rub it together pretty vigorously between your hands and it will become more gel like. I apply about two little scoops and comb it through with a wet brush. I scrunch after and let it air dry. It does okay, I feel like it does cut back on frizz a bit but it’s definitely not a life changing product or anything. The texture is too weird for me to want to continue using."

In the morning I just wet his hair and pick it out a little then add some of this in (about a quarter size) - a little goes a long way! It helps keep his curls nice and tight and moisturized. I love that it is sulfate free and smells amazing!
251,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not fond of this gel. The texture is almost like thick Jell-O. To use it, I have to grab a chunk of it and rub it in my hands to melt it. Unfortunately, I never could get it to completely smooth out. I tried it in my hair and my children's hair and there would be leftover little chunks of it throughout our hair. Also, even trying to use only a small amount, my hair felt horribly dirty whenever I tried it. I just wanted to jump in the shower and wash it out. It's not for us, though. On the bright side, it does smell nice. Plus, if you like a super hard cast on your hair, this will probably get it for you. (It did on mine.)"

But is smells great, and more importantly, it WORKS to tame my long, frizzy, blonde, colored, unruly hair. As I am growing older, my hairdresser is saying my hormones are making my hair even more prone to frizziness (I know right, how dare he?!?) So over the course of the last coupe of years, I have tried frizz-taming goops from the salon and the drug store. Shea Moisture Curl Souffle is the one I keep coming back to.It is clumpy - but I just put a little glop in my hands and rub together until it softens into more of a gel consistency. I don't mind the extra work to have frizz-free curls."

It is for thick curly hair and does have oils in it it may leave your hair greasy if you have very fine hair. Works great on my dry over processed curls. People should read the label and ingredients before purchasing and before leaving bad Reviews. Worked great for me dry or damp. You only need a small amount. It also controls frizz .
254,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is a semi-solid gel and a little hard to get out of the jar. But trust me, you don't need much. A little bit goes a long way. I get a little out of the jar, rub it between my hands and then apply to my hair, starting with the ends. Rub it in well. At first your hair might feel a little greasy, but as soon as the gel dries, that goes away. My  hair is manageable and has volume and shine. It holds it's style till the next shampoo. Truly. My hair naturally is straight and fine. I would recommend this product. Remember, wait till it dries before deciding that it doesn't work for you."

Just was too much hassle to use on a regular basis, I ended up throwing it away 👀"

It's a hard, lumpy jello texture. Started reading reviews and found that I'm far from being the only one with this problem and apparently it's been going on for several months."

The scent is disgusting and I would not put this on my hair or my child's hair for that matter. Disappointed taking the product back where I got it from.

The texture is also rather unpleasant and you have to work it in your fingers for quite some time in order to even be able to apply it to hair.I don't think I'll be using this gel, but I am leaving a neutral rating - perhaps I got a bad jar and it got affected by the air since it wasn't sealed."
261,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Use to be a great Product (DO NOT BUY!!),"A few years ago i used this product when the company was just starting to pop off. I was amazed with the quality and the ingredients in the original product. The Soufflé's used to have silk protein as one of the main ingredients which would made your hair grow really fast and and the strands were thick and strong.Five or six years later I buy the product again, I noticed immediately that silk protein was NOT on the packaging or listed in the ingredients, which was very disappointing. I open up the product to use it and its in a solid form (not the smooth, slippery, gel like consistency of the original product) its messy, impossible to apply, basically useless. What a fall from grace. Please don't waste your time and money you will be greatly disappointed. They only reason I haven't return this product is because i don't like returning stuff."

First, the texture is thicker than jello; you're not even able to glop in your hands in hopes that you can warm it up to make it spreadable. Secondly, the smell is just BAD. Most times I can move past the smell for the sake of the results, but not with this product. This just doesn't work."

It's a fairly wet gel, and does smell good (like coconut), but it seems more for a stiffer kind of hair, not so much the wavy type, if that makes sense.

I usually use their curl enhancing creme which I love, but this is different. The texture of it puzzled me. You have to dig a chunk of it out and rub it between your hands for ut to smooth out. It's also heavy on my hair since it's a gel but it doesn't make my hair hard. I prefer the curl creme to his. I didn't like the result fornthe $17 price tag."

274,"Sheamoisture Curling Gel Souffle for Thick, Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus to Moisturize and Protect Hair 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,One more step,I haven’t purchased this product from Amazon but I will say that the hard jello consistency is the same if you buy it from a Beauty supply store. The formula has changed. I have found that if you put the product in a blender it will revert to gel like texture that we are used to. It is inconvenient but once you get it on your hair it works magic.

Even if it's thick I heat it and let it melt abit .. this can't be used heavily and most times best on damp hair not soaking wet -tap dry abit .. and smoothe it in and trust me it allows whatever product u use after seem like woa!! Very moisturizing !!!This is also very great for finger  curls on hair... this takes some playing round with like how much u need and it's always minimal and how u use if to smooth in or if yo use alone without lean in .. based on the style I use no leave in etc etc thanks Shea moisture this leaves my hair so moisturized I cut it low TWA and it's same as when I had it long I have natural 3c 4a and some 4b curls !

0,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Would definitely recommend,OMG!!! I have tried so many products for my son's hair and this is by far the best! I haven't used the shampoo/ conditioner yet but the detangler and butter cream are wonderful.  They don't weigh down the hair and smell decent! The proof is in the pictures!!! Would definitely recommend
1,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for mixed children,I really like these products. My children are Caucasian/African American and have very curly hair. Their hair smells really good and is so soft after their baths. My oldest son has more coarse hair than my youngest and it will get very tangled after just sleeping but this product has definitely helped. I only give 4 stars because the shampoo/conditioner doesn’t lather how I would prefer and it’s a little difficult to get all over their thick hair. Besides that I love everything about it!
2,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good on soft loose curls as well,"I’m thoroughly pleased with these products. My son has very long curly hair that knots up in no time at all. His hair texture is medium, not too thin and not coarse either. I didn’t know if this product would be too heavy since his curls are on the looser side, but it wasn’t at all. He hates shampooing and conditioning, so making it one step has been awesome. I am traditionally very anti combined shampoo and conditioners because they never work on my hair. But this really does work and his hair is left feeling smooth and bouncy. I am concerned about it building up on his scalp or hair because their isn’t a true shampooing step here. But we’ve only just started using it. The curl butter is great. I put it in damp towel dried hair before bed and his hair is still relatively easy to comb out in the morning without detangling spray. The detangling spray is great as well. I’ve tried other Shea moisture brand detangler spray, it built up and left his hair feeling almost sticky if I used it more than once in between shampooing. Also tried two different Sun Bum/Baby Bum brand detanglers, and I wasn’t impressed with either of them and their smell was too strong. So far this set is winning. I recommend it."
3,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for fine tighter curls,"My daughter has beautiful 3b/3c fine hair, also she's a toddler so I needed something easy. Now this doesn't lather, but it's more like a co-wash I suppose, her hair feels clean after,  not dry. The spray is not heavy on her hair or even on my fine wavy, it's great for detangling dry or wet hair (on curls I only recommend damp or wet not dry) . The curl butter is great on her hair, even on the consecutive days after wash day to freshen up, only a little tiny bit is needed on damp hair. The boys hair is 3a, 3b, its short so it doesn't need much product, but the shampoo and a tiny touch of curl butter looks amazing;) I love it's safety ratings on EWG, as opposed to other curl products out there."
4,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",2.0 out of 5 stars,Would have liked a full tub of curl cream.,Well for starters the curl cream isnt even half full nor did it have any kind of seal. I’ve only used the detangler as I just got it & it worked pretty good!UPDATE- got a replacement & its no different. Not sealed & half full. So this is an error on the company.
5,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",1.0 out of 5 stars,No Lather or moisture. Don't buy.,I hate that there was little to no lather. Horrible shampoo and conditioner.  It was watery.
6,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for toddlers and babies, not too heavy or greasy, smells amazing.","I’ve had a hard time finding products for my toddlers hair because they’re all too thick, they make his hair greasy and his curls droopy. I had tried the SheaMoisture detangler before and loved it. It’s perfect for detangling and refreshing in between washes. The two in one shampoo and conditioner is great and makes washing fast and easy. It doesn’t have a real “lather” effect like plain shampoos if that is what you’re looking for, but I didn’t mind. The curl butter is also a nice texture and really only takes the tiniest amount. Each product has a good amount for how much you use on a kids head, not to mention they smell amazing. Overall it’s perfect for my sons hair that is very fine in texture but very thick."
7,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Kinky Biracial,"On the very first day I saw a difference in my daughters hair. She went from a puffy wavy Afro to curly Sue. Even when I washed her hair later that night I didn’t need any detangler because her hair was still detangled. When my daughter’s hair is wet, she has gorgeous spiral curls but once it’s dry and combed it turns into one big puff. These products allow me to style her hair without it losing any bounce or curl. I am very satisfied. The only con is; I will admit that the cream container isn’t completely full but I understand that this is a very good price and these are expensive, natural ingredients so for the price, I still have no complaints!"
8,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",3.0 out of 5 stars,Small bottles,"Such small amount for the price.  It smells great.  The only problem I have with the curling butter cream is that it isn't sealed.  You opened it and bunch of cream falls out.  smh.  For the price I am paying,  I am not sure that it is worth it.  Won't be buying the trio again though."
9,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for thick, curly kid hair","Other, lighter formula detanglers and shampoos, like Johnson & Johnson's or Hello Bello's, worked okay on my kiddo's hair until she turned 5 or so. Then her hair became thicker and drier and those products just didn't cut it anymore. Her hair was like straw and got into knots so easily, combing her hair was a daily battle. In desperation, I turned to the internet and found this set. I'm so glad I did. It's true that the shampoo/conditioner has no lathering effect, but once you get used to that, it's fantastic. I've been using all three products for a few weeks now and they have made a dramatic difference. My kid's hair is soft and combable again, and she has curls instead of knots. I use the detangler spray in the AM before combing, followed by a dab of the butter curling cream on the dry ends of her curls. I wash her hair every other night with the shampoo/conditioner. A life-saver!"
10,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great on my sons mixed hair,"My seven year old son has both Irish and Nigerian heritage.  His hair is brown, and as he has gotten older, it has gotten curlier and coarser.  This shampoo/detangler/cream keeps his hair clean, moisturized, soft, and shiny.  Thank you!!!"
11,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"I purchased this for my 20 month old daughter. It smells great! We haven’t really used the cream yet. We wash her hair with the shampoo probably 2-3 times a week, but use the spray every morning. I spray a few squirts in my hand, mix with water, and run my fingers through her hair. I’ve noticed her curls are much more pronounced now and I think her hair is even softer."
12,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",1.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't get passed the perfume smell.,"I had to give this away because the smell gave me such a headache after only opening it. I couldn't even try it, it was so offensive."
13,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",3.0 out of 5 stars,Might not work on certain hair types,"The product was received in a timely manner, the only thing is it’s not really keeping my 1year old grandson hair moisturized. The Detangler works will, I thought it would make his curls more define as well but it really didn’t. Maybe I need to look for something else, We are still using it but no change."
14,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"Can’t complain honestly use this quite often in my child’s hair, she has super curly hair which this helps maintain the curls but I do wish it helped with it not being so dry better then it does."
15,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING product for my baby,"My baby has fine, curly hair. This has helped it lock in moisture and bounce. I use the detangler with a ""wig brush"" and add the cream to help with smoothness and defined curls. LOVE these products. Will update review once I use the combo shampoo/conditioner."

18,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",3.0 out of 5 stars,Needs better packaging,The products itself seems to work well on my sons hair. The only problem is maybe package them better. The first time the ups driver had to take it back because two bottles were busted. The second time half of the cream leaked out and some of the shampoo as well. I just decided not to order again because the next one might be damaged as well.
19,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",4.0 out of 5 stars,It works,"Works pretty good, I use it every other day in my son's hair.

23,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",3.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves hair looking like product is in it,I bought this for my daughter who has natural curly hair. I love that the shampoo and conditioner are a 2 in 1 but don’t feel like it gives her a clean feel after. The cream leaves her hair looking oily and stringy even when I use a small amount. The spray is nice to get out tangles.

112,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Each product in this set of three has the slippery elm and marshmallow extracts. I was interested in trying the set because it is specifically for thick, wavy, and curly hair.The portion sizes of the products are extremely generous. The conditioner/shampoo two in one and the detangler are both 8 ounces while the butter cream is 6 ounces. Even the 6 ounce buttercream tub is quite big. Especially for how far it goes on kid hair.Up until now I have been doing two products- shampoo and conditioner for the kids. Anything to shorten the hair washing routine I am willing to try.The formula is a creamy and rich white. It has a subtle sweet smell that resembles a beach or sunscreen type scent. The main fragrance I pick up on in the product is coconut and it has just the slightest sweet scent of a flower. Because of this I find it appropriate for boys and girls.The detangling spray has an easy pump spray and has a slightly murky color to it. It smells similar to the two in one but almost has a little bit more of a licorice scent to it.It’s easy to use and definitely helps with the brushing of hair.The third and final step is to use the curling butter cream. It’s thick and rich but doesn’t require a lot. Of course it’s going to depend on how much hair the child has. It helps to control frizz and flyaways but it’s also helps with styling. My sons hair is quite thick so styling for him is simply brushing out and parting.This set of three really guides the user through each step from cleansing to detangling to styling. It’s all inclusive.I like that this is a safe product with no sulfates, parabens, phthalates or glycol. It’s a safer option than some of these salon products that aren’t necessarily for children. I would much rather use something that is free of harsh chemicals but just as effective."
113,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used Sheamoisture products myself for a few years, they’re great for hydrating curls and generally have a solid product line, so I was excited to see this bundle for kids. The products seem pretty similar to the adult versions and the strangling spray is one of the best I’ve ever used: it even rivals salon brands and detangles hair beautifully with a small amount of spray. The curl cream is beautiful too and really enhances my little ones curls. It’s a beautiful mousse like thick cream and it smells divine. The 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner was ok, and I will continue to use it, but I always feel like these products are quite drying and that you don’t get the full benefit that you would by using both shampoo and conditioner.  I deducted a star because I did find it more drying than what I would expect from Sheamoisture, but I do appreciate that some kids won’t put up with a 2 step shampooing and conditioning routine, so it might be perfect for them. Overall, it’s a great little set, and I would recommend it."
114,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,My son absolutely loves these hair care products. The shampoo conditioner is perfect for him and easy for him to clean and condition it his hair at the same time. Th moisturizing cream curls his hair up and provides great moisturizer keeping his hair soft. The spray is great for the morning to refresh his curls and adds shine. All products smell amazing!! Highly recommend
115,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,It smells SO good!,"I know that the SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine is geared more for kids so I initially got it for my son who hates to have his hair brushed because he has curls like his momma but once I opened it and smelled it I loved the scent so much I started using it too and I'm so glad I did! We've always used shea moisture on our sons and has been a trusted brand in our household for many years. The detangler works great even on my long hair and for my son works out all his tangles with a lot less tears. He doesn't really need the cream so I use that by myself and it shapes and moisturizes my curls wonderfully and also seems to be helping with the damaged ends getting frizzy. All in all it is a great set. I would imagine this would be perfect for girls better as the scent is pretty feminine and I think is more geared towards longer hair. I for one am incredibly happy they came out with this scent and I'm definitely going to have to see if it is available for adults."
116,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing in the packaging and the product itself to call kids to want this set. There is a bottle of  shampoo/conditioner, another bottle of detangler and a jar of curling butter cream. The main ingredients are coconut, hibiscus, slippery Elm and marshmallow extract. The work KIDS is the only thing that has anything to do with children. I think that adults can use these products as well as kids. The scent is very light and I only smelled the coconut in the  shampoo/conditioner. The butter cream curling jar was not fully filled. It has the consistency of rice pudding and left my fingers. that I used to apply the cream to my hair, oily and shiny ."
117,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, I love the smell of these products. The 2 in 1 shampoo/ conditioner is perfect as it’s quicker and more convenient as my daughter hates having her hair washed. The detangler spray works great too. It usually takes me a few attempts to brush through her hair as it’s so long & get tangled so easily. I haven’t used the finishing cream yet - but I’m sure it’ll be just as good as the other 2.The only downside to the shampoo is that it doesn’t lather. I think this is probably because it’s a 2 in 1 and so moisturising ?! Not sure. But still deserves 5 star rating."
118,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Mother of two tendered curly headed wild boys lol I love the smell of this stuff and what it does in the hair. One main thing I’ve noticed is that it’s much gentle on their hair than most popular brands out there. They cry easily with the slightest tugs and tangles I have to get through but I found this making it slightly easier to do. I like to wash their hair in the tub as I find it easier to do it that way and with the shampoo and conditioner being combined it makes for a quicker wash day and less years from water in the eyes lol I like to use the detangler and cream on days apart from washes as well as it works very well with keeping their hair moisturizer and getting out the daily tangles for my their hair. After I apply I braid up their hair and it keeps it nice, moisturized and tangle free for a couple of days."
119,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",5.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter loves her hair again!,"My daughter has really curly hair, and up until we stated using this product we were always straightening her hair. The hot iron was damaging her hair. Now that we’re using SheaMoisture KIDS and Shampoo trio, she feels confident with her hair being curly! This product really helps control the puffiness and leaves her curls looking bouncy and healthy. It’s moisturizing , have a lovely coconut scent, and really easy to use. We love SheaMoisture KIDS!"
120,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have two girls with two different hair types that require different products to be able to keep it manageable. I like that I can use this for both and it works well. I can detangle their hair easily and it makes the shampoo process easy and simple. It also makes the comb out process easy as well. I must say that it smells pretty amazing as well and leaves the hair feeling soft.
121,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Try-Me Set!!,"Not a bad set... the 2-in-1 wash and conditioner are more like a co wash, which makes it easy to use and the strangling spray works pretty well too. The curl creme is very lightweight and leaves a lot of shine and smoothness. It’s not the best product I have used for curls, but definitely good for normal days. My son did mention that it smelled like Play-doh, and I totally agree with that statement. He didn’t mind it at all, but I wasn’t a huge fan.It’s definitely a great set to figure out if this would be a good fit!"
122,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,This trio has one winner in our family- the detangler. The detangler smells great and works wonderfully. It instantly loosens tangles and knots. It allows for easier brushing. On the other hand the curl cream was too heavy on my granddaughters ringlets and light curls. Even with a small amount of product it made her hair look oily. The shampoo conditioner combo did the same thing. It weighed her hair down and created an oily appearance to her hair. Maybe you will have better luck than us!
123,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love this kids hair set. The shampoo is creamy, lathers well and leaves my daughters hair clean and easy to manage. The moisture cream smells wonderful and really keeps my daughters hair from feeling dry. The real gem of this set is the detangler spray. It has a hint of shimmery glitter that my daughter loves. It sprays evenly and smells nice. This spray makes my daughters hair so much easier to brush and has really improved our mornings getting ready for school!"
124,"SheaMoisture Kids Shampoo, Detangler and Cream For Moisture and Shine Coconut and Hibiscus Sulfate Free Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, 3.0 Count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the body products by SheaMoisture but usually don't get the best results with the hair products. These are an exception, though. At least, so far- and hoping they continue to be! They're all gentle but effective. The detangler is probably my favorite since my daughter has very coiled hair and it helps a lot. The others work pretty well also and so far not drying- which is what has been the experience with some of the other products."

Straight coconuts. I have two daughters age 4 and 2 and they love this set. They always comment on how yummy it smells. I think it works really well. I love the detangler.

1,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same product.,One bottle is cloudy and one is clear. These are obviously not the same products. Arrived with cap off.
2,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it imo,"Bought it because of a review of favorite youtuber (Jessica Braun) but it did not work for me. I am not a fan of its scent (it's sweet, especially the coconut) and I need to spray way too much for it to be effective, my hair turns wet. My favorite detangler is Not Your Mother's' 'Knotty to Nice' normally and I can't wait to get back to it as soon as possible. (Note: I have relatively light wavy, thin, oily hair.) If it is your first time and you aren't sure, not recommend it."
3,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,fake bottle or formula changed,"Fake! I have ordered many bottles previously and they all have the same coconutty scent. I buy many bottles because there are several people in this home with very long and knotty hair. The last 4 bottles I ordered do not have the distinct smell, sprays like sticky water, and does not remove all the knots as in previous bottles. I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS."
4,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Insect Inside,"I admit I didn't try it because when I went to use it on my granddaughter's hair I found there was an insect inside. Note that I received it on July 11th, two weeks ago, and it hadn't been opened. At least not by myself or my family."
5,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,This Is Not The Real Product,"The first bottle I ordered of this looked like it had been rolling around in someone's trunk along with rocks for the last 5 years. Plus it had almost no smell and was only very, very slightly cloudy. AND, the bottle was sticky and not full. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement. Well, that one was worse. No lid and the bottle was full...of water. No cloudiness whatsoever. I use this product ALL THE TIME for my girl's hair and it is usually cloudy white. I don't know what is being sent out, but it is not the real product. Into the trash it went. Luckily, customer service is refunding my money and looking into the listing, so that no other unsuspecting customer gets scammed."
6,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Product I received from Amazon wasn't quite the same as I received from the store,I usually buy the product from the store but I came acrossed it on Amazon for a great deal. When I received the product almost It smelt the same and it had to be pearl white look to it where it's kind of shiny meaning the liquid but the whole bottle stays liquid like that even without mixing it up whereas the ones I get from the store seem to separate and the Pearl Light textured stuff goes halfway down the bottom and then the top half is more clear and you have to shake it I also noticed the stuff I received from Amazon doesn't seem to detangle or moisturize as well. I did read some reviews saying that the stuff they received was fake maybe that is a possibility I'm not a hundred percent sure but there's definitely something different about it. The bottles looked exactly the same but it did not come with a lid
7,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great detangler for kid with lots of fine hair,"This is the one item I hoarded when the lockdown began: it works magic on my daughter’s hair and she loves the smell. I used to just use pure coconut oil, but her hair is fine so if I don’t braid it oil makes it heavy. She has a lot of hair and likes to wear it out, this detangler is light and saves both of us from tears too.The smell is sweet but not overpowering and doesn’t linger too long."
8,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fraudulent Product -- Buyer Beware,"This was most definitely NOT a legitimate product. We're long time users of this detangler in particular and I couldn't make it to the store so I decided to buy online. Biggest mistake ever.I got opinions from several people comparing the seemingly toilet water mixed with white mica powder and a dab of cheap conditioner that just all sits at the bottom to the legitimate product and everyone agreed I got ripped off.  Even the label was faded and gross as if it'd been dumpster dived, filled up and resold.I ended up having to just fill my old bottle with conditioner and hot water for the time being. There is no way I'm putting my daughter's health in danger with this unknown concoction that smelled like cheap conditioner and butt. I'm utterly disappointed and Amazon doesn't accept returns on beauty products. Stay away and just take a trip to Walmart if you can."
9,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great for my friend's daughter's hair, not great for my daughter though...",Let me start out by saying that this product works great for my friend's daughter's curly  hair! That's why I purchased it for my daughter for her wavy hair. It doesn't seem to work as well on her's for some reason. Her hair tends to get really tangly and matted in the back and she refuses to wear it up to avoid tangling during the day. This detangler didn't really do anything for detangling her hair so that I could brush it out. Her hair was dry when I sprayed it on so maybe if I try it when her hair is wet? It does smell amazing and it did moisturize her hair without being greasy at all and I sprayed a lot of it on her hair so that's a nice thing. I don't know if I will purchase again though.
10,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome stuff,I stay stock on this.  I usually don't like shea moisture products but this detangler is the truth.  I have 4c hair and my kids 4a and it works great for all of us.  Nice light scent.  Moisturize and detangles without weighing down the hair.  I love it
11,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy,"So I was looking for a good detangler to use on my daughters hair and this is what I received. After almost two and a half weeks of waiting for my package to arrive, I get a bent up bottle (the packaged itself was fine) with a sticky tar or jam like substance on it.. and the label of the bottle is worn out like the bottle had been recycled or used previously. I didn’t dare use it on mine or my daughters hair but I’m pretty sure this isn’t the real deal just from the appearance and quality of the bottle I received. I don’t usually leave reviews but they have the right one today. This “product” will be going in the trash and my money will be refunded back into my account. At least the Amazon  customer service bots were helpful."
12,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Product!!,"I have really long hair and this stuff is great!  I used to buy the one for adults of the same brand that I absolutely hate, but had bought this for my daughter at the same time and I ended up using it.  I have really fine individual hairs, but have so many of them that I actually have incredibly thick hair as a whole.  On top of that it is really wavy, setting up the perfect storm for issues with brushing.  Just a couple squirts of this and I am able to brush my hair…oh, and it works well for my daughter’s hair too.  We have bought this product repeatedly and intend to continue doing so.  I definitely recommend!"
13,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but terribly shipped,Was missing the protective cap and had started to leak in the delivery box.  Also doesn't spray out... only dribbles.  Of course the seller doesn't do refunds or exchanges... it seems to be a good product but skip the hassle and buy in store or from another seller.
14,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Fake item, do not buy!","This item took over 2 weeks to be delivered, when it arrive it was not sealed and with no cover. I tried to return the item and it states not eligible for return. I believe it's water in the bottle and nothing else. I will not be putting this item in my child' s hair."
15,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The scent is delicious!,"I love this detangler, it smells so good and works like a dream! I know it is listed as a product for kids, but I have used it for years. It is difficult to find, so I was very pleased to find it on Amazon with a lower price than Target."
16,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for kids or adults,My daughter has hair thats right in between 3A and 3B and hated having her hair brushed but this spray makes things super easy right after washing her hair. Plus it makes her curls super bouncy and it has a nice smell to it. If you don't like the marshmallow smell it may be over powering at first but you get used to it after the 3rd time or so. Honestly the results alone are worth ignoring the smell while brushing
17,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,FAKE PRODUCTS???,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Got three bottles. One doesn’t have any wrapping nor cap, label faded off. They don’t look legit at all. The liquid is clear and the scent is strange. Doesn’t have the cloudy/ pearly white color like the one I got from the store. Also the bottles are sticky leaking everywhere. What a ripped off I got!! What is going on?"
18,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used Product?,"Product arrived without a cap, leaking, with the labeling rubbed off and smeared. I haven’t used it, and am hesitant to do so judging on the appearance. Did I get a used and returned product? The scent is very faintly of coconuts but it seems watered down. Everything else that I ordered in the same package arrived in perfect condition so I know it wasn’t damaged in shipping."
19,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Old or used product,When I went to use this I realized the label was worn in places and there was no cap on it. I squirted it because if it's new it should take a few pumps before squirting anything but it sprayed right away so it's been used. This is the first time using it so I don't know what it should smell or look like. Found out it's not eligible for return.
20,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,I have ordered this before and it is a great product delivered in a timely fashion in perfect shape. This time I ordered 2 bottles and they came without caps on the top so they were leaking and the labels looked like the bottles were old or beat up.
21,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for toddler hair,I use this product on my toddler hair . She gets a lot of knots in the back of her head from rubbing her head during her sleep. It’s very good product for hydrating her hair and making it manageable to style . Her hair is very thin and it’s not heavy doesn’t make it look greasy . If I have to say a downside it would be that you have to really really shake it before use . If you forget you’re basically just using water with all the product sitting on the bottom of the bottle or straight product caking on her hair.
22,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cap missing and appeared opened,Spray came without a cap and bottle looked damaged and used.  Contacting Amazon since they do not allow refund/return for this product.  Seems like bad customer service to send a damage product and then not rectify the problem.  In general when I bought this product from cvs it is great. I refuse to use an open container on my kids for safety.
23,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,DON'T BUY,"Along with the others, I forgot to read the reviews before I ordered the product. I am a busy mom and I ordered it out of convenience. I buy all these products for my baby. Now, I still have to go to the store and replace the product. I'm not comfortable using this on my baby because it is not sealed and slightly damaged. The scent is not correct. Something that was supposed to be easy for me just became complicated... please stop this seller from selling more of this product."
24,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must buy clean great product,Bought for my daughters unruly dry curly hair and sensitive skin. Immediate difference with softness and shine so tried it for myself who is very into clean safe products. My hair feels amazing! So soft just ordered for myself
25,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Watered down version of original product!!,"I am very unhappy with this product. I have bought this for years in the store and I decided to take a chance on ordering from Amazon. This is NOT the original formula, it's just a watered-down version with barely any scent and does absolutely nothing to my son's thick, curly hair. Trying to return for a refund but it says it's not eligible for some reason. I just received this yesterday so I know it's within the 30-day window."
26,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy it’s FAKE,"I smell a huge lawsuit!!!! I’ve been using this product on my daughters hair for like 2 years and I know it’s supposed to be thick white creamy consistency. Well I got this and thought maybe the formula changed?! I called the company and they said nope. So I had a replacement sent out same thing. Imagine if the actual product has been replaced with something super toxic and people who hadn’t used it ever thought this was the real deal but their child’s hair started falling out, imagine the devastation !!!! Who ever is doing this should be ashamed of themselves!!!!"
27,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use this all of the time!,It’s been my go to hair product for my one year old daughter. It works well for her type of hair (mixed). I also use their other products and have read these reviews. Mine have never showed up opened or destroyed. I have bought roughly five times within this last year. I use it often along with their other products.
28,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not just for kids!!,"SO GLAD I GOT THIS. My hair has been super dry lately and trying to brush it when wet has been a nightmare. This not only makes your hair smells amazing (and dry quicker, I’ve noticed) but it works wonders to de tangle!! It keeps my hair soft and shiny as well. Sometimes I spritz a little extra as I curl it in the mornings and it keeps it shiny and soft without feeling oily."
29,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing detangler, smells great!","This is such a life saver! My daughter has really long, fine hair. She is really harsh on her hair and absolutely hates having it brushed out. I put this in after the shower and it brushes right out...so much less pain...for both of us!"
30,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,It came beat up looking.,"Its alright. I used it on my baby it works for his hair but probably wouldn't work on an adult with full head of hair because it dosnt work for my hair type full and curly, It had no safty seen or safty cap and the sticker was faded like it had been from somone who possibly dumpster dove for it, unprofessional and kind of sus."
31,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best,My daughter's hair just by looking at it tangles. It's wavy but more curly as you get to ends. She's also tender headed this is a huge lifesaver. I just spray give it a min and than part sections spary a little more in dry areas and we end up with detangled hair and argument free. She's 9 1/2. Lord help me.
32,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same product as in store,"When purchased, I notice the product has some shimmer within the liquid, but it it mostly clear. When I purchase this product in store, the liquid is cloudy and the shimmery substance settles to the bottom of the bottle. The cap was not taped and most of the contents leaked from the bottle."
33,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works really well and doesn’t weigh down curls,"This stuff works so well for curly hair! It smells great and I also like that it is high on the list for EWG “safe products”. The bottle lists a bunch of chemicals that it is free of which is a huge plus because I mainly use it on my kids. I use it on my hair occasionally (thick, wavy/curly) and it really helps detangle. I’m happy with it and glad it’s less expensive then what we used previously."
34,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible,This product it just terrible. From what I read on other reviews I should have jus purchased this from an in store retailer. The version I was sent from here was garbage. The spray top doesn’t work at all. Also the actual product left clumps in my sons hair. Amazon did refund me but just want to forewarn people.
35,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, wow.","I’ll be honest I HATE the smell, it makes me so upset lol. But the detangling is the absolute best thing in the world. I am forever going to use this product on my child’s hair. He says EVERYTHING hurts when it comes to his hair but this stuff I don’t hear a PEEP. It’s honestly the best invention in the world for tangles 10/10 would recommend 🙌🏼"
36,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disgusting,Not the correct product! No cap! The label looks old!! Looks like someone filled a fake product in the bottle! Buyer beware!
37,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"non refundable, bottle opened, liquid spilled, label peeled off, liquid inside not clear.","non refundable, bottle opened, liquid spilled, label peeled off, liquid inside not clear and different from target version. Can't use since and been trying to return and unable. would give a zero if possible. very upset."
38,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everyday use!,My daughter has thick crazy hair and we use this every day after bath and the tangles brush out so gently and easily! We even use it in between baths when her hair is tangled or wind blown and it makes brushing so much easier! I love that you can use it on wet or dry hair and it doesn’t leave her hair greasy
39,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Product Cap Not Sealed,"There was nothing to hold the cap of the detangler product to the bottle of liquid and once I opened the LARGE envelope, the cap was separate from the bottle and the bottle was moist from the product leakage. Did not return since it was a small amount of leakage, but would suggest a smaller mailing package or something to seal/hold cap onto spray bottle. Product smells great."
40,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t Recommend 👎🏻,Nope I used this on clean hair and it did not help with frizz and made my hair very crunchy 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 It also smells a little weird like play dough
41,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible packaging.,I use this on my toddler. Great product. First time I had issues but the packaging was sad and effortless.  This item had no lid on it. Came open in transit and soaked the box and other products. There is none left to use. Disappointing.
42,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,love this stuff so much,i have tried every detangler and this is the best thing ever. i love there products and wont use anything else ever again anymore .this is the best. it doesn't stay in your hair afterwards so no grossness and smells great
43,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure it's the real deal!,First of all it came without  a cap and the one I purchased for my sis also didn't  have a cap! It smells different and looks different than the product in the store.  I was so skeptical that I threw it out after purchasing one from my beauty supply store....waste of money!
44,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ugh- how does this happen?,The cap was open and it spilled all over the box. I have about a 1/3 of the bottle left. Super bummer.
45,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good but...,"No cap was on the bottle, and it was half gone and exploded all over my other orders. Love the product, just not happy with how it was handled."
46,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the real thing,"The label is damaged, it didn’t come sealed and came without a cap. It’s cloudy, not clear like it’s supposed to be. Also contains fragrance which isn’t listed in the ingredients online. Definitely don’t feel comfortable using on my child! And figures, it’s non refundable."
47,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Used this on my daughters frizzy curly hair. We also use the shampoo and conditioner. Have shown improvements in the curl of her hair. This smells great and helps with detangling.
48,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Eh,"Not very good detangler, has a good scent and slight shimmer but not good at detangling my sons very curly hair"
49,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This Stuff,"This is such a well-made product, it works very well on my hair, it detanglers my long hair, the scent is amazing, and the price is even more amazing! What’s not to love?"
50,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used??,Did not attempt to use this product. The bottle was not sealed and the contents looked like water was added to it. AND it'  s not returnable 😤
51,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,For sons hair,"My son has thick hair, I use a little water and this stuff. It makes his hair very manageable for styling, it’s magic for me. I’ll continue buying this, the scent is definitely a plus!"
52,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,SKIP,My 4yo daughter has super curly ringlets. We have been using a product from SoCozy. We couldn’t do ANYTHING with her hair after applying this. I have used it on my own with no benefits.
53,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Real?,Are these actual Shea Moisture products?It’s making me select stars to be able to post. I haven’t use these yet and I’m a little hesitant because of the packaging.  The box was sealed well but there was only one lid in the box and both labels are torn/damaged.
54,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for everyone,I got this for my kids that I nanny & they use it everyday when brushing their hair. This is magic. U spray & detangles right away. No pain. I needed to get one for myself as well lol. Highly recommend!!!
55,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Brand, but this product was below standard","Didn’t have much of a scent to it. Definitely didn’t moisturize. Did help detangle some, not much. I usually am pleased with this brand. Purchase Sheamoisture products often, so one miss won’t turn me away."
56,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This,This is my favorite product for my 1 year old's hair. She has very curly hair and it immediately tames the curls when they get frizzy. It smells awesome too.
57,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice but like water unfortunately,"Works best on wet hair. Looks and feels like water so I'm never sure of when I've put enough. Positive is that it makes the hair super soft. We are black and my daughter's hair is super thick and curly. People always assume she's mixed. The product works nicely for her super thick, long, and curly hair"
58,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,I'm not sure this is legitimate.,"This is how my package arrived. I have bought this product from the store multiple times and love the actual product. I am not convinced that this is the real thing. The lids were off and the tops were loose so it seems that liquid spilled out because the bottles have stuff on them that makes them sticky, so I'm hoping that's what it is. I guess I will just have to stick to buying this from the store."
59,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad product not same info without lid,I got first one was empty and damageSecond one was not same product I usually bought it it was not clear and made  my daughter hair greasy
60,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is NOT the same!!!,This is not the same product I have been buying for the past year!!!!! Smells totally different and feels awful!!! I bought this a couple weeks ago and it arrived half empty so I reordered and this one is either a totally new formula or FAKE!!! I am very sad as this was the only product that worked on my toddlers very very curly tangles!!!!
61,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged bottle and no cap,I bought this for my daughter super long tangled hair. Got it just today and got it out of the box and the label is yucky and it had no cap or seal on the bottle. It does smell really good! But…..Very disappointed.
62,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived broken, spilled & no returns!","Opened a wet box to discover the lid was broken, and the product leaked all over my other Amazon items. The bottle looked faded and old. Worst part- no returns in this product! Really? So disappointing!"
63,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy Feel,"The scent is very pleasant. I bought this detangler because I like this brands kid shampoo in the same scent. However, the detangler left my daughters hair feeling greasy afterwards. I won’t buy it again."
64,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it just hate how it was sent to me,It came somewhat open and lil over half of it wasted in the box. And the spray top don't spray it just run out. Wish they could fix it but I keep getting to run around 😭
65,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent detangler,I love this product! It's a bit on the pricey side but works better than other detanglers I've used on my daughter's hair. Works very well
66,SheaMoisture Kids Extra Moisturizing Detangler for Curly Hair Coconut and Hibiscus Kids Detangler with Shea Butter 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do Not Buy Scam,This product arrived with no cap or seal. The label is all scratched and appears to be extremely worn. Compared to one purchased in store and does not even have the same scent highly dissatisfied

It has the ability to get epically tangled after a day of playing. This stuff works wonders to help keep her hair soft and shiny. The smell is lovely and doesn't last long, which is nice since we're not into scented beauty products. We've tried other detanglers (Original Sprout had too many weird ingredients and the smell was over-powering--CA Baby detangler didn't help detangle) and none have worked as well as this one for the long hair. Good stuff. I definitely recommend it. I even like to use it in my hair if I need a quick little fix to get my fine, straight hair to cooperate. The ingredients are all easily recognizable too. If we hadn't found the awesome and amazing Apple Valley shampoo bars for our hair, I would even consider the Shea Moisture shampoos, but we're trying really hard to decrease our use of plastic bottles and bar soaps work well in that department."

Brittle, frizz, split ends... Also, my hair is quite thick. This product is UNBELIEVABLE!!! If you like coconut scent and are in need of a real miracle, try this. I have used it both in wet and dry hair. Honestly, I like the results better on dry hair. I use a little bit after the shower, before using a hair turban towel. Then, once I let it air-dry, I apply abundantly over my ends and general hair frizz. The result is really like a miracle for my hair. The downside of the product is the price!! But, oh well, something that works!!!!!!"

This stuff is a miracle worker!! I have searched and used so many products on my toddlers very spiral curly hair that knots just from a sneeze. This spray has gotten rid of the knots in just a few minute process! We use it in conjunction with the tangle ease brush and it works wonders!! So happy! It says not to wash it out but we usually put it on dry hair, brush then leave it in over night. We have also washed it out and it didn't seem to make a major difference."

I bought this a year or so ago for my toddler daughters hair. She wakes up with a rat's nest on her head, especially in the winter with her flannel sheets. This isnt the cheapest detangler but also not the most expensive. I thought when her first bottle ran out I'd try a cheaper brand and I was SO disappointed that I returned it and bought this one again. It makes the hair almost oily to untangle it but it dries with no residue. I just spray a few sprays, work it in a bit and gently brush through with my Wet brush. The pics speak for themselves!"

Yes. Moisturize? Not for low porosity hair. Anti-Frizz? NOPE!,"So this spray claims to do 3 things: stop frizz, moisturize, and detangle. Lies. It only manages to detangle (I've only tried it on normal knotted hair. I don't know how it would perform on matted hair). I have 3b, medium density, low porosity, medium thickness, armpit-length hair. I spray the detangler, detangle my hair, but then start feeling it dry and frizz up not even 2 minutes later. I add different conditioners and stylers on top to try to tame it and it has limited success in moisturizing but still fails at controlling the frizz.It might be the coconut that is drying it out/making it feel hard since my hair is low porosity, so I wouldn't complain if putting an added conditioner would counteract that. But no. The frizziness is what ruins this for me. How can a product claiming to be anti-frizz make your hair more frizzy after application than before? Insanity. I won't be trying it again."

I hadn't used the coconut & hibiscus detangler from SheaMoisture before but it was VERY thin and watery compared the the coconut detangler SheaMoisture sells. The product I received does not have a strong smell. I had ordered the coconut & hibiscus shampoo and conditioner and curl smoothie for my daughters curly curly locks from a different Amazon seller and those products all had a pleasant strong smell and creamy thick consistency. I think I would order this detangler again but not from OxKom. I'd order from a different seller and give the product another chance because I love the rest of this line!

It made styling so much easier and I didn't need to use nearly as much. She has fine hair, but a lot of it and her hair wasn't greasy or weighed down from this product. I imagine this will be even more useful for my other daughter who has curlier hair when she gets a bit older."

My kids are mixed, I am Puerto Rican and Panamanian and my husband is Greek. Both my boys are very hairy. My son has curly, fine hair. When he sleeps or lays on his back, the back of his hair tends to get matted and knotted. I spray this stuff all over his dry hair and then directly in the matted parts. I didn’t even need to use a comb, I literally separated them with my fingers! I am going to but tons of this stuff because I plan on using for my long, curly hair!"

I use the 2-in1 shampoo and conditioner on my child’s curls and liked it well enough. This, however, is awful. It’s like a bottle of water with a hint of coconut smell. I saturated a curl, yes just one curl, and no go. I tried over and over and sprayed more and more and not a single tangle was detangled nor did his hair look moisturized. Maybe I got a knock-off? Returning and getting the previous Cantu brand spray. It wasn’t great but way better than this."

It does not condition on its own or moisturizes the hair long term though, (which isn't its primary use) so I follow up with my favorite leave-in conditioner (Soultanicals Knot Sauce) and she's good to go. Anything with slippery elm and marshmallow root in it is going to provide amazing slip and this product is very much a staple in our house now. I use it on my 4b hair and it works AMAZINGLY well to rehydrate my protective hairstyle and helps me brush through my ends while retwisting my twists.5/5 would recommend."

This stuff works miracles, leaves her hair ever so soft and smelling tropical and sweet! Honestly can't say enough good things.

It also seems to add some volume to my hair as well. I don't notice the fragrance as being strong or overpowering. I plan on buying this detangler again.

But, we prefer products that don't have a lot of ingredients that we cannot pronounce and that we don't want in his hair. We only wash his hair once and week and we do condition. We only use products with few ingredients that are as natural as possible. This detangler we have been using for over a year, perhaps two. We have tried four other ""Natural"" detanglers and they just don't work that well. They get tacky very quickly and they feel as though they need to be washed out right away. One even didn't seem to help at all, only seemed to make the hair wet and smell good, but did nothing to help.Like all detanglers, it isn't going to undo the knots for you. But it helps the hair slide and undo better than anything else we've tried and I now use this exclusively. I think it is the coconut oil that is really doing the trick with us, but I can't be sure.But it works! And we don't have to wash it out right away and it smells nice."

I opened the box before most of the product leaked so i was happy at first, i tightened the bottles and figured maybe they were just rushing to ship them out.. the problem is the formula is different.  (Or they sent me a diluted ones). I bathed my daughter and use it on her as usual and it is not untangling her hair nor it doesn't smell like anything.  It just smells like water.. very disappointed.........Original post:My daughter unfortunately inherited my tangles.  She was born with long hair and I obviously did not want to hurt her by brushing her hair. After searching,  I found this. I am IN LOVE and so is she. She is now 19 months and we use about 2 sprits on my palms for her whole head (so little goes a long way here) after showers. Focus on the knots and try to work it in but dont saturate that its dripping (like I said, you only need a little). The product is magic. It smells great and it untangles in no time. I use it with her pink wet brush. Great combo ."
0,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Ok first the smell I am in love with....but you have to be a coconut fan. But did I say it smells good - ok yes - so I bought this for my biracial son who has medium curls and mixed texture hair - smooth on the top and coarse in the back - it makes his curls more defined and soft but it does not give a lot of hold -I like that this product does NOT contain any parabens, sulfates or phthalates....Overall if you are a fan of coconut and are looking for something to give soft definition to curls this is your answer...."
1,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,It. Works.,"For the vast majority of my life I've had the frizziest hair ever. Brown bears waking up after a winter-long slumber have sleeker hair then me. I bought this stuff from Target several years ago, figuring I was wasting my money on another product that wouldn't work. Well I was wrong. It has tamed my frizz - even when I don't use it after a shower, my frizz is so much better then it used to be. I'm a grown woman but I love the scent of the children's so that's what I use. I have to buy it on Amazon now - not sure if it was discontinued in stores or if it's so popular I can never find it. Either way, highly recommend."
2,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,Ive tried many others for my daughter. This one is the best.
3,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not satisfied,"It came fully package and closed. But the amount that’s in there for the price , it’s kinda skimpy if you ask me. I bought this item in stores and it came with alil bit more. I had to turn to buying from the seller because there weren’t none in stores. Overall I gave the ingredient quality a 1 because I don’t like how it’s not filled up like I thought it would of been. But it works great on my kids hair, Shea moisture has been my go to for my kids hair for 7 years now. As of today I use their kids baby shampoo , 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, their kids lotion even shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner for myself. Great Products, just wanted a little more quality for the price."
4,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!!!,"I can not tell you how much we love this stuff! I have two daughters with curly hair as well as myself, each of us with different curl types. This has been the best universal curl product we have found! It smells amazing, feels amazing, and forms beautiful soft bouncy curls that are very easy to refresh!!!"
5,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",1.0 out of 5 stars,Quatity portion in each tin is not worth the momey,Fair. I would not recommend it to anyone because they were almost empty with only like 3tea spoons in each tin. It worked good though but portion is not worthy the money.
6,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but seems like there’s product missing.","Had a seal on it but it wasn’t actually sealed, just kind of laying on the top of the jar and it doesn’t look full, like there’s definitely some missing."
7,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Curl Definition!,This product is moisturizing for my hair without leaving and product build up. It defines my curls Nd there's minimum shrinkage. I know it states it's for kids but I find this product to work well for my 3c/4a mix curls. Other products can be to harsh or not enough hold. I'll only only have to apply this product after a wash and it'll hold the curl definition for 3-4 days with re application. Oh and it smells amazing!
8,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bette than expected,"My baby girl is blessed with thick abundant hair at an early age and I was apprehensive about using to many products so early.  I started doing her hair at about six months and I tend to use more natural products.  This product really works for us as it smells good, has very little residue and it keeps her hair moisturized without the ugly build up.  I am very impressed and very satisfied."
9,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,This has been the best product for our foster sons hair. Would highly recommend for dry curly hair to reduce frizz
10,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is either a fake or something changed in the production.,Its flakey and leaves residue on  my  daughters hair.i have being buying this product for 4 yrs on amazon and this is the first time am not satisfied with the results.

87,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,Tames the bed head frizz!,"I have 2 kids with super curly hair. I don’t have curly hair AT ALL so it’s been a struggle to learn how to maintain their lovely locks. I started using this after bath time and it really helps hold their curls, even after sleeping. They do still have some noticeable bed head that I use another product to take BUT it is a huge difference from the tangles and frizz they used to wake up with. I don’t shampoo their hair every night but I do get it wet before using this because their hair is fine (they’re 2 and 4) and if it’s dry, it’s too sticky/heavy. This probably wouldn’t be a problem for kids with tighter curls or coarser hair though. I am so glad I tried this because it really works and now my kids have gorgeous curls instead of wild rats’ nests. And it smells great!"
88,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Kids Curling Butter Cream, 6 Ounce, 2Pack",5.0 out of 5 stars,No crunchy feel!  Works fabulously.,Love this stuff! No crunchy feel.

0,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best scent and beautiful curls,"Love this shampoo!  It doesn't lather. Which I like, not sure why that's an issue for some. There is no need for shampoo to lather other than we have been conditioned to think that's the only way our hair will be clean.  This product cleans great, smells great and hydrates my toddlers curls! I won't use anything else leans!"
1,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my son’s textured hair,My son is mixed Mexican/Black and has beautiful curls. I was struggling to find something that would keep his hair from drying out. Finally found it! This product is great and makes bath time easy with only one step for his hair (I used to shampoo and condition his hair). Now I only massage this in and let it sit for a couple minutes and rinse. And it smells great! He loves it.
2,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not my favorite Shea Moisture product,"This does not suds up, which is supposed to be better for hair, but it doesn’t seem like it got my daughter’s hair clean. Her hair is long and thick in the back, and it was hard to massage into her scalp. The directions say to massage into hair & scalp for 3-5 minutes. Who has time or energy for that, lol? Especially since her hair doesn’t seem clean after messaging for 5 minutes. Also, I still needed to use a leave in conditioner to comb it, so I wasn’t impressed with the conditioning aspect either. I’ll stick with the Shea Moisture Baby Shampoo & Body Wash."
3,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This 2-in-1 is awesome! It smells amazing, untangles hair so well, but it doesn’t lather/get soapy like traditional shampoo or 2-in-1. It is kind of expensive for the amount you get, if you have long hair like my daughter and I, so for someone with shorter hair you’ll get more bang for your buck! Overall, really good and a great, trusted brand."
4,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for biracial hair,"My kids are biracial, so their hair has different textures. This shampoo/conditioner smells great and keeps their hair moisturized, especially when combined with the detangling spray."
5,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but doesn’t foam,Good but doesn’t foam
6,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,This shampoo has terrible curds inside,I tried to use this shampoo yesterday and it was as there were curds inside- I guess this was the conditioning part- I couldn’t make them to dissolve- they were all over my grandson’s hair It was terrible I couldn’t get rid of them I am sorry I didn’t try it earlier so I would be able to return it
7,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,"My 2 year old curly girl doesn’t love having her hair washed so this has been very helpful and it makes her curls look good for the most part— I have found I have to be as an actual shampoo every 3-4 washes though or her hair starts to look like it has buildup, you know that kind of dill waxy look? Yeah. I’ll still buy it again though!"
8,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great until after dries.,This brand has some great products but not this ooone. I bought this product for my daughter. To be fair it was for curly hair which she does not have. Only option available.  I was so excited it smelled amazing out of the bottle. I made sure I rinsed it really well but afterwards it made her hair look super greasy. The smell when it dried almost smelt like plastic. DO NOT RECOMMEND. If you haasave curly hair might be great. Except for weird smell.
9,Sheamoisture 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for Kids Coconut and Hibiscus Coconut Oil for Hair and Dry Curls 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Does Not Lather,This seems more like a co-wash than a shampoo/conditioner.  I have to use a considerable amount to get any type of lather so I'm never truly sure if its getting my son's hair clean.  It does smell heavenly.  I'm also not sure if its tear free so I just try to keep out of his eyes just in case.  I won't be purchasing again.

0,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,Item was open and half of it was used. This is unacceptable and j will be getting all my receipts together because this is not the first item I got like this. Covid or not this is unacceptable and means I cannot try buying any items like this or even medicine
1,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,Warning!!! Seal already opened and content reduced

3,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product; horrible handling,"I was looking for a light cream to use for my 4 month old.  I like how it leaves her hair.  I heard people mention how the product cakes in the hair,  only a small amount is needed and it has to be rubbed in.  My only issue is that tough it smells great, the scent isn’t light. Also another issue not with the product but the seller.  This product arrived with the top broken  and it seemed as it the product was less than what was supposed to be there but I don’t think it had been used."
4,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure what everyone's talking about mine was full,"I'm not exactly sure why the other reviews were expecting this to be filled to the brim...but it was literally the same amount you get at the store. If it was shooken up it's more likely from poor package handling of the drivers . Anyways my baby boy has super curly hair the back of his hair required more moisture than the front due to friction from sleeping on cotton material, this product helped put so much life back into his hair I love it and would recommend for anyone with dry hair . I even use it in the back of my head (kitchen) and it makes the texture super soft . I love this stuff"
5,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not greasy, makes curls soft!","My son was getting a serious ratty frizz spot on the back of his head from sleeping/car seat.

A little goes a long way, so it will last a while."
6,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,BAD SERVICE,Am not very happy with this order. I bought this product for eight months old because of her hair and I was recommended this shea moisture product. First of all this product wasn't sealed properly and packaged came spilled all over.

7,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Never Again,"I had purchased this after seeing a glowing review video. The first order I received, both containers were opened, one unsealed (looked as if it had been used and returned maybe?) and opened the second was unsealed and had big holes poked into the inner seal. I returned for an exchange. I had received the items, both sealed properly upon inspection. I tried the product and I felt like Christina on Mommy Dearest when she got into the setting lotion and Mommy chopped her hair. I could not comb or brush through my hair. needless to say, I returned it and I sticking with what I was previously using."

82,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,Missing product!,It came with a big hole in the middle! A lot of miss product. Smells really good.
83,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good,I bought this for my daughter. Her hair is so curly and it gets frizzy. It also does not stay in place very well. I use this when I pull her hair up and it holds her baby hairs all day. She is 1.5 so if it can hold her hair though all the hyperactive toddler activities it can hold anything.
84,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,My grandson is mixed and has curly hair. His hair was always dry and never looked like it had been combed. I bought this for him and  told his mom to use it daily. Now he has pretty curls. I also bought the detangling spray so his hair would be easier to comb. I highly recommend.
85,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,Works well; use sparingly,This smells so good and works well for curly hair. Use sparingly or you will have a greasy wet look.
86,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so nice.,"This product smells so great! I love the smell of shea butter! My niece has hair that goes everywhere and this stuff really tames her hair and shows off her beautiful curls. Amazon did a horrible job shipping this item. It was shipped with a book and neither was protected and the box was oversized.  For anyone who doesnt know, UPS has a drop policy of 6 feet. This means that items sent through UPS are supposed to be packaged to withstand a 6 foot drop. This doesnt mean that UPS throws your item around, but you know, thing happen. Had Amazon used some bubble wrap around this item or a smaller box or anything, the lid would have broken and the book would not have ripped. No fault to the manufacturer of this item. The item is great. You may want to consider what other items you purchase along with this item though. Even though the lid broke, the item barely leaked out, which is great."
87,"SheaMoisture Kids Coconut & Hibiscus Curling Butter Crème, 6 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,My product came in and it looks like it was used.,It looks like it's been used. My first time opening it.
0,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,I love the smell of this lotion!  Its very moisturizing. BUT...it doesn't squeeze well through the lid.  I have to remove the lid every time I use it.  Its almost too thick for the bottle.  The bottle crumples when squeezing it out. It almost would do better in a container rather than a bottle .  Other than that flaw it's a great lotion!
1,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,I love the product but...,"I love the product, it is not the first time I buy it (although is the first time with this seller). I know it works amazingly on my skin. Nevertheless, this is the first time that the bottle arrives missing some product. I feel disappointed. If I pay for an amount of product is it weird to expect that amount?"
2,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing moisturizer!,I love this moisturizer. I wanted to stop using coconut oil because it was so thick and greasy that I always felt uncomfortable in bed or even when I went out. I wanted something that was going to moisturize my skin very well but still soak in quickly. That’s exactly what I got. It makes my skin feel extremely smooth and moisturized. Definitely worth the price!
3,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smell overpowering,The smell is over powering. I wouldn’t wear this to bed. Ima keep it as a hand lotion. It is very moisturizing. If anyone is familiar with that hair line it smells exactly like it. So it’s weird I feel like I’m putting on conditioner. I’m not sure about being for sensitive skin
4,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the lotion, hate the container!","Please sell this lotion in a jar not a bottle!! I love the lotion. It is thick and creamy and not greasy. The lotion absorbs well, preventing frequent application. The smell is luscious.That being said, because of the thickness of the lotion, it is almost impossible to get out of the bottle! I finally resorted to actually using a bread knife (a dangerous prospect) to slice through the bottle so that I could transfer the lotion to a jar!!!Otherwise, a great product."
5,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,Makes skin appear tone and smooth. I have already purchased my second bottle
6,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells delightful,I have sensitive skin and I loved this stuff! It makes my skin super soft and smells SO good! I pair it with the coconut hibiscus sugar scrub and can’t say enough how much I like it. Definitely my favorite scent and lotion!
7,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scent and moisturizing,"I like better the one with the Passiflora and pistachio scent. I could only get the bar of soap but how I wish I had he lotion. Did you discontinue it? It's smell do good.***the picture I sent you, above, is the one I would like; it smells so good. Do you still sell it? Like better than the coconut scent. Tq"
8,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to get out the bottle,"I like the scent of this lotion and the silky feel of it, but I don’t find it very moisturizing the way some more traditional lotions are. However, my biggest issue is that the bottle is just wrong for the this lotion and it’s hard to get it out. The bottle is made of hard plastic that is difficult to squeeze.  A tub would be perfect. It’s very thick so I don’t think a pump would solve the issue."
9,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very Strong Scent,"This lotion has a VERY strong, overpowering scent - too much for me. Also, while it is moisturizing due to shea butter and coconut oil, I'd have to say that plain Gold Bond lotion is way better - thicker and more healing and protective -  with no odor. There was nothing ""illuminating"" for me about this cream."
10,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good and moisturizes well,Excellent product I love it so much! It is quite a thick consistency almost more like a body butter than a lotion which makes it more difficult to dispense but it is so moisturizing and smells so fresh and amazing
11,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Possibly opened/used product,This lotion smells nice and is thick but the bottle's seal was already off and stuck in the cap so I don't know if this is a used or authentic product. I'm waiting it hear back from Shea Moisture to see if this is normal or if I should return it for being opened or possibly used.
12,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Buy with the scrub,"I love the scent and the thickness of this lotion. It leaves skin very soft and glowing.  The scent lingers so that's an added plus for me.  The bottle is a little hard to squeeze after awhile, but I've found if stored upside down, it will come out easier during the next use."
13,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,From someone who hates lotion,"I have been known for my general dislike of lotion over my entire adulthood. Hated the feeling of it and did without for the longest time.Unfortunately I am getting older and the need for a moisturizing routine has become essential to prevent crypt keeper status skin. Bottom line, I love this lotion!It feels amazing, smells amazing and absorbs so deeply into it the skin I was throughly impressed.I was unable to find this product in local stores anymore but, am greatly relieved I will be able to stock up on my favorite lotion of all time right here on Amazon!"
14,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!,"We love this lotion and will be purchasing more of this brand! Even my husband loves it and that's saying a lot. It is very thick and smells good. Due to the thickness of it, I keep it upside down on my bathroom counter so it will be easier to come out..... and it has worked just fine."
15,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly Surprised,Ran out of usual CeraVe and couldn't find it on Amazon. Tried this and am pleasantly surprised at how moisturizing and rich it is. It is very thick so I rub a blob in my hands before spreading on my body. Love the light tropical scent.
16,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product!,I love this moisturizer!! My neck had rough skin texture but now it is super smooth!! I use it everyday after I get out of the shower and put it all over! My skin feels so smooth and the scent is super nice 🙌🙌🙌
17,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Softens Aging and Dry Skin,"I love the scent, and that the fragrance lingers for a while. It is very thick, and that helps it to really absorb into my skin. I even use it on my face. It works great. I am 70, and this lotion works the best for me."
18,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to get out of bottle,Hard to get out of bottle
19,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job,"This lotion is great. The only downfall is, it kinda “rolls” off of the area you rubbed it into to. SO, do not put too much on. If smells and feels good on your skin, but too much will roll off."
20,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Moisture, moisture, and more moisture!",I love the fragrance. This moisturizer also is great with making the sponge curls.
21,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,HEAVENLY SCENT,"I adore this scent!! I've used this lotion, the body oil, bar soap and body scrub. I can't wear perfume because it triggers migraines, so this is an excellent alternative to perfume."
22,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Prefer it from a store or direct retailer,Very disappointed in the scent. Its not what I expected. I found a mini version of this in a las Vegas grocery store and it smelled alot better than this! It's supposed to be a nice fresh scent of coconut. This one is very faint and almost chemical smelling like. Its unfortunate cuz I thought I was getting a good deal. I rarely write reviews so I'm honestly just letting people know this product really disappointed. Will buy from shea moisture website next time instead.
23,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,smells great,"i love this i've been applying it for the past hour it smells soooo good. I regularly use the Olay vitamin e lotion but i wanted something with a fruity fresh scent and i've definitely found it I just wish it would come in a bigger bottle. also, I can see how the thickness would make it difficult getting it out the bottle, but the smell and feel makes it so worth it"
24,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Will purchase again!,Does not illuminate but has long lasting softness. I like the consistency but it doesn't come out of the bottle easily. A pump would help.
25,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love that it is affordable.,Moisturizing my extremely dry skin and it helped with eczema.  I am not fond of things that are scented for the fact I have asthma.  Many companies use synthetics to scent their products. I loved this lotion but would prefer it to be less scented or unscented.  Excellent buy for the money!  Love this company so much!
26,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,the lotion is too thick,"The scent is amazing, but the lotion is too thick and it is pretty difficult to apply and  it's very hard to take from the bottle"

28,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is nice but too thick,Very moisturizing and smelled nice. However the product was too thick for a squeeze container. Would work better if the product was in a pump-type container or a jar.
29,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silky,"I believe this product is great. It’s silky soft on the skin, smell fresh and clean. I love it"
30,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lotion,The scent is great. Not too strong but will last all day. The thickness is not watery at all but will keep you moisturized all day.

32,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smooth,"I like the scent and the way it feels on my skin. The only thing I dislike, is the fact I have to take the entire lid off just to get anything out."

My only gripe is that you have to have the wrist strength of a ninja warrior to get the lotion out! I'm using both hands and still struggle. I wonder if there is a pump version."
80,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great all over moisturizer,"Love this stuff. I'm in my early 40s and have very sensitive skin and allergies. I started using it as a facial moisturizer after showers, and my skin is getting so  soft, smooth and dewy... beats a lot of more expensive facial moisturizers I've tried. It does take a little  while to fully absorb, but lasts all day and a little goes a long way. Been using for several weeks now and have not had any break outs so far at all. I did knock off one star for the bottle/pump, which is not great. Would be better if this same packaged in a jar as the consistency is thick and creamy like a body butter. I just squeezed some out into another empty jar I had on hand."

It is one of the best I've used in a long time. My only complaint is that it is so thick that it is very hard to get it out of the bottle. I have arthritis in my hands, so the hard plastic is very hard for me to squeeze even using both hands. It needs to come with a pump for thick creams and that would make it perfect."
85,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite skin cream,Love the feel of softness. Very mild not overwhelming smell. Love the applying cream on my skin this cream is very rich dont need much.

93,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lasts all day,This is great lotion! But the bottle is not the greatest. This lotion should be in a different kind of container.
94,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing but does not provide much moisture,"I was disappointed that this wasn’t more moisturizing.

95,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Lotion- Impossible to get out of bottle.,"Smells nice, very thick. It is body cream, not lotion. The squeeze-cap quickly clogged. Product is too thick to invert and shake out of bottle. I can't believe this product made it on the market like this. The packaging is absolutely incorrect for this type of CREAM.  I would not buy again on account of 1/2 of it is still in the jar and wont come out.Sticking your finger in the bottle to try to get the lotion out..."
96,"SheaMoisture Coconut Oil and Hibiscus Illuminating Body Lotion for Dull, Dry Skin, 13 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Packaged in the wrong bottle,"This really is some of the best lotion out there, but SheaMoisture uses the wrong delivery vehicle. I have to take the top off every time I use it and since it is so thick, I lose a quarter of the bottle because it doesn't move through the bottle. It should be packaged in a flat container with a large opening in which you scoop out what you need, like they use for some of their other products."
0,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer,"My hands looked like the Cryptkeepers. No amount of lotion was helping.I purchased this after reading both the positive and negative reviews. Obviously those that wrote the majority of negative reviews cannot read label instructions or ingredients.The scrub semi separates into chunks, shake the jar gently and voila its fixed. One review said it was salt. It's sugar, vitamin E and coconut oil with hibiscus. It smells tropical the scent is a little strong but I like it so no issues.I use it after the dinner dishes are done. I scrub my hands and work it into the cuticles a bit - it works amazing on dry cuticles. It feels great. Rinse and pat dry. My hands GLOW. The scaley skin is gone. The dull skin transformed. I put lotion on afterwards and it feels like it actually sinks in. My hands have never been in nicer shape and they no longer look like they're centuries older than I am.Could not recommend more highly.UPDATE - I took this in the shower. My whole body was glowing. I am prone to KP breakouts and I was worried it might cause a flare up but I'm smooth as silk. I used it before I shaved and probably got the closest shave of my life. Rinses clean no greasy feeling. This is replacing my $35 body scrub and I'm now keeping it in the shower and on the sink."

I used it anyways because I really needed to exfoliate that day and just have kept using it and I've been fine. Probably not one of my better decisions though. It exfoliates well and smells good. Won't order again. Trying different products until I find the ""one"". Tree hut was my go to brand but I'm switching it up. Hate shopping in store but might just go that route."
4,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Delicious scrubbing perfection,"Oh I love this stuff!! I’ve tried a bunch of body scrubs, especially for my inner thighs as they can get a bit darker due to some light eczema. First use my entire body felt like a cool cough drop lol but so soft and smooth, even my sinuses were happy. By the second use the dark spots faded and were almost gone. The scrubbing factor is perfect. I even sprinkle some at the bottom of my shower just to wake up in the morning. This is the only scrub I’ll use and will be stocking up! Highly recommend"
5,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a fan,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   After actually going to the store I found out that this is indeed how the scrub is supposed to be made. It’s very moisturizing but aside from that I wouldn’t buy again still. I’m not a fan of the product and this is not the sellers fault but the scrub company .It seems to be a copy cat of the real thing. I haven’t tried the real thing but I have made at home scrubs and this is what it feels like with essential oils. It’s very dry and has little to no oil I added my own coconut oil other than that I wouldn’t buy again ."
6,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't be happier!,"I love this stuff.  I ordered it because I was running low on my Tree Hut stuff that I got from Walmart and I couldn't be happier.  It smells wonderful, which was a concern of mine.The consistency is very different from Tree Hut, but I think it's a good thing.  It's not nearly as moist, which I think is great because the sugar is more concentrated so it will last longer.  It's way more moisturizing imo than Tree Hut.  I do use it in the shower though so I kind of add water to it as I use it.  Negative reviews talk about the seal being broken- mine was slightly broken but I didn't even think twice about it.  The product might just need a better seal.  I will be purchasing this again!"
7,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken seal,Seal was broken so I’m going to return it wish I would’ve read the reviews first I would not recommend.
8,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow.,"I am not very beauty care literate...For years I thought I had dry skin, it turns out I have a build up of dead skin that I need to constantly exfoliate away. This stuff is amazing. Since purchasing it, I’ve been using it nightly. I think eventually I can work up to using this product a couple times a week. But for now I am really enjoying my nightly showers using this stuff. I get out of the shower feeling so soft, silky, and generally feel better about myself. It also smells amazing!"
9,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spa treatment in a jar...,"This product is amazing. It was recommended by a nail technician who uses it for her clients’ hand treatments. However it is also a body scrub with just the right amount of thickness. The first thing that captures you is the scent. It truly, truly makes you feel and smell like you’re having a spa treatment, detoxifying your skin and calm your senses. Both your skin and you feel refreshed leaving your skin silky."
10,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Gently Used!!,"It arrived in a box that was well packaged, once I opened the box the top was not secured on the jar and the protective seal was already open as if it had been removed already, the product is all clumped up in huge chunks, I am displeased and will trash this item, I don’t like to pay for things that has been GENTLY USED!"
11,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tape the @#!$ Lid!!,"These body scrubs are a great product at a good price, especially on subscribe-and-save. But you don't seem to be paying any attention to all of the reviewers - including us - whose products arrive with loose lids and broken seals... resulting in oil all over the shipping box and everything that was shipped with it. It has happened every single time we've ordered. TIGHTEN AND TAPE THE LID SHUT BEFORE YOU SHIP THESE BODY SCRUBS. PLEASE! Better yet, put them in a sealed bag, as well. So far, nothing has been damaged, but it's inevitable the way subscribe-and-save items are combined for shipping. And the oil is supposed to arrive IN the product, not all over everything else."
12,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,i’m disgusted,It was already opened and it looks like it’s even been used before. there’s literally lint or something in there. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
13,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,"I've used a bunch if different body scrubs out there and this one is by far the best. Its a rougher scrub but gets the job done. I have very sensitive skin and Im surprised that I'm not beat red after using, which I love. Usually with a coarser scrub I look like a tomato, but bit with this one. The smell is really refreshing, not overpowering, and my skin felt really detoxed after using. You kind of feel like a human peppermint patty (in a good way). In that sense it does have a menthol/cooling effect which I can't wait to use in the summer, but it being the winter its kinda intense when the cool air hits you. Definetly wakes you up but you feel really refreshed. Strongly recommend!!!!"
14,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Item was opened,Waste all over box. It's seem the product  is heavy and should have been  sealed  more securely.  Always  product  didn't  last long. Use in one use. Smells great. Very relaxing scent. I slept like a newborn baby.
15,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Was open when I got it.(second one too),"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Update: Got a replacement on 12/28/2021 and the product was open too. I'm just so over this! I really do like this product but it just seems that no matter what I'm going to continue to get used/opened product. Needless to say, I'm very dissatisfied and want a full refund. I'm not willing to use something on my body that has been used or I feel has been used.I was wondering why I could smell it through the box. When I took the plastic lid off the deal underneath was open and it looked as if the product had been used. The smell is amazing. Wish it wasn't like this cause I really wanted to use this product! There's just no way that I'm comfortable putting this on when the seal was broken and it looks used and there are black specks in it."
16,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"Ive tried a lot of scrubs, this one is my fav.  the first time I tried it I knew it was the one for me.It doesn't melt, it isnt messy like coffee scrubs. It feels good on the skin and it exfoliates very well. I love that its minty, which makes my skin feel even more clean,  but the mint also invigorates the skin.  There is plenty of oil at the bottom of an empty jar that you could apply to your skin after bathing, I stead of lotion. Or add the extra oil ro your new jar upon opening it."
17,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Item arrived unsealed and used! 🤮,"I absolutely adore this scrub and I was so relieved to find it on Amazon. However, the scrub arrived unsealed and appeared to be used. To rectify, I requested a refund and a replacement scrub, but that too arrived in the same condition. Do not buy from this seller!!!"
18,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"ok, but I'm not going to buy it again","I bought this as an experiment, since it didn't cost all that much.  like most other body scrubs I've tried, it is mostly granular and dry, hard to get out of the container and mostly falling onto the floor of the shower before you can rub it into your skin. and I'm careful--I try hard to get it from the jar to my skin and rubbed in. what you do get rubbed in works well. it does make the shower somewhat oily. it's better than nothing, but I'm going to keep looking!"
19,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Received a replacement with a seal!,"I first received a jar where the seal had entirely dissolved. I toyed with just using it anyway, because it seemed to still be fine. But I decided to exchange it, and the replacement they sent me had a perfectly intact seal. In the photo, you can see there is a pretty big difference between the sealed jar (top) and unsealed jar (bottom.) The sealed jar is way more moist and less like dry sand. However I tried them both on my hands, and they actually seem to moisturize the same. As for the smell, I don’t love it. It smells like the tanning lotion they sell to use with tanning beds. It’s not a bad smell, just a little too strong for my nose :)"
20,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Like others said it arrived opened,"I feel like this seller is opening these and taking some out or something, this seal doesn’t open like that in shipping. I’ve purchased this at the store and it’s amazing but it came opened and dried out. I read the other reviews and thought no way so many were already opened when they arrived, maybe I’ll be lucky. I was not. Love the product but definitely would nit buy from this seller again!"
21,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,This has got to my favorite product of 2021! It leaves my skin feeling like a newborn. Even if I haven't shaved it still makes me skin feel great. Highly recommend
22,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vegan friendly,"This product is great for dry feet, I use every day in shower; noticeable difference."
23,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received a USED jar,the safety seal was half opened and clearly product was missing. This is really unacceptable and Amazon should not allow contaminated used products to be sold
24,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,The fragrance is nasty and way too strong!,"I can’t rate this for effectiveness, because of The Smell.  I could smell it before I even opened it (of course, the seal was broken as seems to happen with every other jar from this company).  I love the coconut/hibiscus scrub and the mint scrub.  I’m afraid I’ll have to send this one back.  I tried a tiny bit that was stuck to the lid on my hands, and the smell is very offensive to me.  SO strong, and I could not for the life of me wash it off.  I don’t want my body or my bathroom smelling like this nasty stuff."
25,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural ingredients & makes skin baby soft!,"Trust me, I’m super picky, but it leaves your skin heathy and soft. Depending on how fresh it is, it consistency can be quite oily & has grainy pieces of salt (which I personally love), so if you like very mild scrub, it’s not for you. But if you just rub it in your skin all over your body and wait a little until it melts into your skin blending with oils, you’ll be rewarded with deeply moisturized and silky smooth body skin👌✨"
26,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,There was a slight burning feeling after use,"The smell was okay, but the product was dry to the point that I had to add my own cocoa butter to the scrub and after using I felt a slight burning to my skin.  I will only use this product on my feet nowhere else because the product burns.  Only use on your feet and make sure you lotion after use."
27,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, not too oily",This is my favorite body scrub for bath time! So many other scrubs have way too much oil and make me feel like I waterproofed sealed myself or something but this stuff has just the right amount of oil to keep skin feeling soft instead of slippery with an oily film.My skin is also very sensitive and many products give me temporary redness or bumps. This is one of the few that I can tolerate without any negative skin reactions.Definitely worth a try. Been using this stuff for years and it will always be my go-to scrub!
28,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall good,"Came without being sealed so a majority of the oil leaked out of the packaging. It looked brand new so I’m assuming it was manufacturing. I have oil by them that’s similar so that was added and it’s been effective at getting rid of all the red, dry bumps I’ve always had on the back of my legs."
29,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this exfoliator!,"It’s winter in Ohio. This means dry, dead, itchy skin. I needed an exfoliator to remove dead skin before moisturizing and chose this product. Fortunately, after using this on my entire body in the shower, I didn’t feel the need to moisturize further. Took out a whole extra step for me which is a plus. It leaves a bit of an oily feeling on the skin but it’s not overbearing at all. My moisture deprived skin actually likes how it leaves it feeling, lol."
30,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazinging Soft Skin! Smells Like Hibiscus!,"I've used this product only once, and my overly print hands are so soft at night!!  It does help moisturize too!  The scent smells just like hibiscus and leaves a nice hibiscus smell on you without smelling like cheap perfume or poporroui.  I don't use it on my face, just everywhere else.  I'd recommend avoiding the eye area if you use it on your face since the sugar grains are thick.  I also think you get a good amount for the cost."

   Idk if it’s normal for the seal to be broken and for the clumps to be there but this totally shocked me. My scrub came USED!!!! Please buy your bath essentials in store because this is one of many items I’ve bought that came in used, not as described or expired."
32,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,SO STICKY AAAHHHHHHH,"I ignored the handful of negative reviews because there were so few and the positive ones were so overwhelmingly happy with this scrub. Boy was that a mistake. I don't know if I got a bad jar or what but it was very dry when I opened it. The scrub part itself was fine, nothing to write home about. But good God, it's SO STICKY. It's like I rubbed a layer of rubber cement across my skin. I washed the area four times and still couldn't get it all off. It's now making my clothes stick to me. Gross.It does smell really nice though. It can have a star for that."
33,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff is great!,So so happy that Amazon now carries this product! Been using it for at least 5 years. It smells great! The caffeine tightens the skin and wakes you up! The salt scrub exfoliates without burning or rash even on sensitive girly parts! Highly recommend
34,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived opened and used,"I have purchased this at other retailers many times - the actual product is definitely 5 stars, but this order was not. Arrived open, used, oil everywhere.The actual scrub (previously purchased anyway) are amazing- great smell that’s not overpowering, moisturizing, just awesome stuff. Get it somewhere else instead of trying to save a buck or two!"
35,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product.  Too bad shipping is hit or miss,"I have this as a subscription item (1 tub lasts me 2 months) and absolutely love it.  The smell is very refreshing, but be careful.  If you use a lot of the scrub and don't have the bathroom vent on, the smell can become very strong.  The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is that the shipping doesn't always go well.  I""ve gotten at least 5 deliveries already, so I feel I've given it a fair chance.  Sometimes the item comes intact with no leaking.  This is usually when there is some bubble packaging, and a fancy silicone band around the lid.  More than once I have received a cracked item, or the silicone band missing and the product has leaked significantly.  This last time I got lucky.  There was a good sized leak but it didn't ruin the food items in the box and the box was delivered just before the cardboard weakened and gave out.  Overall, great product, but the shipping is like playing Russian roulette."
36,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing and makes skin silky smooth,I have sensitive skin and this is an amazing scrub. The scent is addicting and sweet.  I have found shaking the container before each use evenly distributed the oil that settles to the bottom.  I love how it makes your skin soft and luminous long after using it!
37,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST ADDITION TO YOUR SHOWER OR BATH EVER!!! <3,"IF YOU HAVE SKIN THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER (I don't know if this would irritate sensitive skin because fortunately I don't suffer from that) BUT BOY OH BOY THIS IS THE BEST STUFF EVER! This stuff is not just for ladies! If you ever want to have the softest skin, use this stuff to exfoliate! Exfoliate everywhere!!! (Not your face or other sensitive areas) especially if you shave, exfoliate first! You'll end up having softer and smoother skin,  with less razor burn or cuts! And don't get me started on how this stuff smells. So heavenly 💖 💖 💖"
38,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,NO SEAL ON ITEM! LOOKS USED!,"I ordered two of this item and when it arrived the box was covered in moisture. Once I opened the box there wasn't a seal for the two items and it was effortless to open. I opened the product and it came in chucks it definitely smells good but i will not use this item due to it not having a seal. Its a shame, i was excited to use it and the smell is wonderful. One should never put a product on their face that hasn't been sealed before hand."
39,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,SMELLS GREAT NEED BETTER PACKAGING FOR SHIPMENT,When the pkg came and I opened the box I realized the scrub was only held together with a thin piece of plastic only in the middle. Not even the whole thing and a good amount of the oils was in the box no longer in the container. I'm keeping it cause I don't wanna go through the trouble but overall smells really good and exfoliates well. I only used once so far so still need to see how well it works.
40,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s straight scrub crystals,"This product doesn't moisturize. I recommend using the crystals to scrub your hands/body daily, rinse, & follow up with a moisturizing lotion after. I use it twice a day and my hands & cuticles are so soft now. My hands use to be rough with dry skin from my diabetes. But this product has given my skin new life. Highly recommend."
41,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lasting Awful Scent,I have had body scrubs that were really nicely scented this one was horrible. The scent actually must have the ability to get into the bloodstream because I was tasting it and could not get rid of it for half a day. I liked the results of the product but the lasting scent was awful.
42,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it!,"This was magic in a jar. This can used in shower after shower or before, and leaves a wonderful sensual scent, soft skin.  Also, I use it to clean hands that are rough from house cleaning, leaving them very soft, not dried out, sorta sloughing the dead skin away.  No more cracked fingers for me! WILL buy more."
43,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disaster,"When I got this product, it just looked like all the liquid had evaporated and it was a big can of hardened sea salt. the seal had not been broken, so I decided to try it anyways. Shortly after scrubbing it on, I developed red bumps all over the applied areas (hands, legs, arms) and it lasted almost 10 days! I had to apply cortisone creams and take benadryl to counteract the effects and I'm pregnant, so needless to say was a complete disaster."
44,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite Things List,"Highly recommend this Shea Moisture African Wild Water Mint Detox & Stimulate Body Scrub. The scrub does not scratch your skin and dissolves as you scrub and does not leave you too oily. The menthol and stimulate after rinsing leaves you awake and refreshed. Or if at night, the stimulation and mint scent help relaxation. I have added a little bit of Shea Moisture Oil to increase the moisture when using. This is a popular product, b/c it tends to be sold out often. 5 Star"
45,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,Love the scent and I love how it leaves your feeling moisturized after the shower. I don't feel like I need to put lotion afterwards. The scent makes me feel like I have perfume on and I can smell it throughout the day.
46,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisurizing,"Since this product has coconut oil in it, it is VERY moisturizing. I feel it does an okay job at scrubbing, but it is very moisturizing. in the future I would probably use a different product because I don't like the heavy coconut oil feel after use, but if you have really dry skin this would be great."
47,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken Seal,"This came with a broken seal so I returned it. Since it was already open, I could smell the fragrance and didn't care for it much. It's very over powering too. I will look for something else."
48,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smell great but scratches skin,"The first time I use this I ended up with scratches on my leg that kind of felt like paper cuts.I assumed I just felt too hard, even though I’m used to body scrubs. So the second time I used it I applied with my hand and lightly washed and still got scratches. My teen daughter did aswell"
49,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived open,"The container arrived open and the product was dried out.  I figured I'd just add some water, and it would be fine.  It just turned into a rock glob.  So, unfortunately, I really can't review the actual product.  It smells good and, the tiny bit I did get out, is definitely rougher than the other scrubs I've tried."
50,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lasting Scent and Softness,"This is my favorite sugar scrub! I like it a little more course, and this one is. It has an incredible scent that last through the day, I get compliments regularly. I always lotion after a shower, but when I use this there is no need. Love everything about it!"
51,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for my hands!!,I bought this to help exfoliate my hands. It works well the scent can be a little strong at first but once you wash and dry your hands you can't really smell it anymore. I ise it a few times a week and have seen a HUGE improvement! I would recommend!
52,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff,Overall I give this stuff a really good review. I don't use this for moisturizing properties or care about the scent much. It's super abrasive and that's exactly what I'm looking for. This probably isn't good for sensitive skin.. my motive is deep exfoliation for body. This works and doesn't dissolve fast or melt away.
53,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I use this product to exfoliate my skin once or twice a week. I have very dry, sensitive skin. This really helps my skin feel smooth and less dry. I like that is is almost like a sand consistency but you can feel that there is some sort of nourishing oils. I would recommend this product! The only thing I didn’t like is when it arrived, It had leaked oils into the box it came in with another item I ordered."
54,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It was open, leaking and seems different","I have used this product from store multiple times, tried online purchase since it wasn’t available at stores and it’s different. It was also open and also leaking. Next time I rather wait and buy from store. Disappointed"
55,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bugs in Product,"Don’t buy this off Amazon. Go to target, Walmart, literally anywhere else. Opened this in the shower and saw small brown bits but didn’t think anything of it since it’s a natural product. The product seemed a lot dryer than I originally remembered, so I decided to mix it around. Turns out the little brown bits were tiny dead bugs. Absolutely disgusted. Never going to buy this online again. I love this brand and their products, but it’s not worth the risk."
56,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Why my package is open?,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   since I received my package it arrived open and everything is dry very different from the presentation, I would like to buymore products of this brand the smell is very rich but I do not trust anymore."
57,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely an exfoliant,I like how this is is a hard scrub so really gets the dead skin off. It's not like those liquid scrubs that do nothing. The thing I don't like about it Is that it makes your body feel oily after.
58,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,BURNS! & became rock solid,"This products scent is very good but it is so strong that it burns your skin! The oil stays on your hands and if you touch any other body part such as your face or private areas, it really burns!Also, after two weeks, the scrub became rock solid with all the liquid on top, I couldn’t even break it up with a knife!Don’t waste your money, tree hut is better"
59,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,just like visiting the salon,"Decided to try my hand at home manicures.  I may not be good at painting my own nails, but at least this scrub and a nice shea butter hand cream give me that fresh mani smoothness that I've been missing."
60,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for hands,"I purchased this product specifically for my hands. However,  i used some on my face... it is a nice exfoliating product. It left my hands smooth and soft... the scent is not strong, yet lingers a little while."
61,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Seal broken twice!,Product unable to use because both times my package seal was broken opened and dried up you can see the moisture all over the box very disappointing waste of money had to throw away twice!!! Smells good all over the box but didn’t get to use !
62,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but doesn’t ship well,"The product itself works wonderfully, however it doesn’t hold up to shipping very well my first one had to seal broken and the oil leak through the box. I just received my replacement again the seal had popped open luckily most of the oil remained in the container. I’ve seen some that say they look like they’ve been used and then shipped out I don’t think that’s the case I think that may be due to the heat it just doesn’t ships well  BBC as hoped for.  Due to having my product replaced and using it and being very happy I would definitely take my chances on ordering this again."
63,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great but..,"I love this scent but when the package arrived, both scrubs were dried out and not sealed properly.

64,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,I should have read the reviews first,I was looking forward to receiving this.  I opened it up and it was completely unsealed!!  The seal was up in the lid and about 1/3 of the scrub was gone.  It looked as if someone had used it.  I won't be using it.
65,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it but the smell,It smelled a little too artificial for me.

66,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Skin Like Silk!!!!,"On top of smelling heavenly this product was super moisturizing even after one use.

71,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing,Wow! I would definitely recommend...the granules literally melt on your skin and its so moisturizing! I love it! The smell can be a bit overpowering at first but u get used to it and the minty burn on your skin..lol..was a shocker when I first used it but the feel of my skin after use sure made up for it. Use sparingly! Don't recommend if you have extremely sensitive skin..the mint and ginger together packs a punch...but ..I love it!
72,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok. For detox the body mind and spirit,"I'd of liked a better stronger scent; but the cleanliness afterwards; makes up for this. I love scrubs and try different varieties. I might pass on another brand; just because I love sented essences. Overall, I'm quite pleased. Expensive though for non thickness."
73,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,No thanks,There was absolutely no seal on the paper between  the lid and the product.

79,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"The smell isn't my favorite but it is in no means bad, the smell wouldn't have stopped me from purchasing again. My skin is freakishly soft and smooth afterwards and it never is. But my main issue is it came with the seal broken and there was only a small layer that wasn't dried out. I got three uses out of it before I reached the layer that is as hard as a rock and I can't do anything with it. It is a fantastic product I would have bought again if the seal wasn't broken."
80,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good…texture could be improved,Added a little water because the texture seemed to be void of moisture and hard to get out of the bottle but once I did it has been great and smells delicious.

83,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,👍🏻 PRODUCT 👎🏻 PACKAGING,"The product itself was great. But a message for the company: CREATE PACKAGING THAT CAN WITHSTAND TRAVEL. I have gotten 2 of the scrubs, both with the security seal not even glued on to it.At first I got the first one replaced, only for the second one to come with a detached security seal again. I’ve read a bit of reviews saying the same thing. SheaMoisture, don’t cheapen your look when you have great products please."
84,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken seal,"Item came with broken seal and oil leaked everywhere!  don't feel like going through the hassle of traveling to return a broken item, so I'm just taking a loss!

368,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,was old. dry.
369,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!,"I've tried many different brands of body scrub and this is my constant go-to. Not only does it smell nice, but the texture/grain of the scrub is really good and exfoliating. It's not too watery, yet not pasty like some of the other scrubs out there. It has the consistency of wet sand, which I like."
370,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky residue that took 3 days to remove,"This is the worst possible experience I have ever had with a bath/beauty product. It burned my skin and left the most horrible sticky STICKY residue. I had to use pure coconut oil to make the burning stop, and I was scared to scrub the sticky off bc my skin was so inflammed from the mint. I am no stranger to mint and essential oils, this is STRONG and smells like garage chemicals. Not a hint of pleasantness in the scent. I had a full blown panic attack trying to get the stickiness off me. 30 extra mins in the shower, layers of oil, skin so soft and a final layer of baby powder made me feel somewhat normal again. I had plans couldn't spend hours scrubbing and adding more chemicals to my inflammed skin. Its now the next day and I'm still sticky with blue fuzzies stuck to my legs from jeans. Absolutely so upset I paid $15 retail for such an awful product. Please do not waste ur money time or sanity. Unless there's someone you absolutely hate and want to gift them with a sticky foul smelling scrub. Or if you want tiktok fame go ahead and Gorilla Glue Girl yourself with this!Edit: Day 3 and I'm still scrubbing residue off my legs."
371,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!!,I have used this less than 5 times and I am amazed! The cellulite on my tights has reduced greatly so much. I have no doubt with continued use that it will be completely gone. I very rarely leave a review but this one I had to. I can’t speak to the scent as I am not able to smell but I would pretty much take any smell for the results I have seen.
372,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite part of a pedicure brought home!,"My favorite part of a pedicure is the minty foot scrub. I was so thrilled to find this on Amazon, and so excited by how well it works! It is a bit rough and I probably wouldn't use it as a body scrub, but it is absolutely perfect for my feet and legs. It gently exfoliated and tingled. I love it!"
373,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best but it smells good,"I love the scent and it makes my skin feel soft after using it. The product does, however, feel like some sort of wax coating after using though. Also, it gets dry and clumpy within the first few days so you have to use it pretty fast. My face burned when I tried to exfoliate with it so stick to using on your legs arms etc."
374,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,HOW does this have good reviews?!,"I'm baffled by how the Water Mint & Ginger scrub has good reviews! I used it for the first time this morning and I smell like I rolled around on the Home Depot floor rather than taking a shower -- and my skin is covered in gross sticky goo! It's like tree sap. I tried washing it off with soap, shampoo, hand soap and I'm STILL sticky. In fact, I'd probably smell a lot better if I had just used tree sap! Maybe I got a bad batch or something but this stuff is nasty and I'm never buying it again. Purchase at your own risk!"
375,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Idk,My box had a huge oil stain on it and the container itself was oily so i assume something leaked from it…I would truly appreciate a replacement or even a refund cause I think everything that makes it somewhat oily leaked out of mine!!
376,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Made my skin soft,This smells so good and made my skin so soft. I like it very much. Was worth the buy.
377,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Opened product,This product was opened when it arrived. Did notnread reviews to my regret. Returning to Amazon asap!  I can't trust an opened product with all the stuff going on in the world. Who to say what was injected into this scrub. Very dissappointing.
378,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT for the ARMS & NECK. Makes your skin feel SOFT,"Excellent for softening your wrinkled skin on arms, neck and legs"
379,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely sticky and waxy,"I got this body scrub at Walgreens on clearance thinking it was a good deal. Upon taking a shower the scrub was invigorating but left a horrible waxy feeling on my skin for 2 days. All of my family members have had this same problem with this scrub as well, maybe it was just a bad batch or I don’t know what ingredient inside the scrub would leave this residue. I would not recommend this product to anyone especially if you’re looking for smooth skin afterwards."
380,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the scrub,"Ummmm, $49.95??? Save your money and buy from CVS for $12ish!! Love the scrub, makes my skin feel soft and smooth."
381,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Skin cooling,This stuff smells great and it feel good when rubbed in. Its not harsh like some scrubs how ever it give your skin such an intense cooling sensation when you step out of the shower.
382,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shower Bliss!,I love this product! It makes your skin feel smooth and tingly afterwards. When I rub this on I just feel like I’m taking really good care of myself. It’s my favorite bath product ever.
383,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,In love,"I love this! Leaves my skin baby soft. I even use a very little amount on my face and it minimizes my pores. I love the mint smell, very relaxing!"
384,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, but the packaging…","I love it! It smells great and leaves skin really smooth afterwards. I use it as a pre-shaving scrub—Afterwards, I use my shaving cream (Cremo). This product in combination with my shaving cream really helps me get an extra close shave that leaves my legs feeling really smooth and moisturized. Get it!CON: the only complaint I have is this: I’ve ordered this product twice now and both times the container’s seal had somehow come undone in transit and it leaked lots of the oils into the package and onto my other items. Despite this, the product works very well. Just wish it came packaged differently to prevent breakage."
385,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another great product from SheaMoisture,I’m a big fan of shea moisture-i like both their hair and skin products. I gave this a try because I can no longer find the coffee and coconut oil loose body scrub that they make or made. I’ll say this one has some zing scent wise! It also gives your body a cooling sensation which will be very nice in warmer months. I’ve used this scrub a few times now & I like that it exfoliates beautifully & leaves my skin so soft without feeling oily. I don’t even need to apply lotion to my skin after using this (although I still do for maximum softness and hydration).
386,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cannot beat the price!,"This scrub is coarse so if you are looking for a fine exfoliation, this is not it. However, if you’re wanting a deep scrub that leaves behind refreshing oils - this is it! I love using this before shaving. It gets all the dead skin off, leaves you feeling fresh and has a moisturizing affect. I haven’t had ingrown hairs since using this and can’t beat the value. Smell is earthy which is typically not my favorite but it’s not overwhelming (I’m more of a vanilla scent person) and doesn’t linger. I’ve repurchased several times now."
387,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,This scrub is GREAT!,This scrub is great. Its a fine texture so I use it almost everyday.  As with other reviews most most of my containers have arrived with the foil seal slightly broken but the product itself is fine even if it gets hard just wet your fingers a little bit run it across the top and it'll start to break up and you can still use it. Some people wrote reviews that said they actually threw it away but the product is actually fine. It leaves your skin feeling very soft and smooth.  It also smells terrific. I have been buying several at a time so I don't run out I don't want to be without it.  I also like that it doesn't have a lot of terrible stuff in it and they don't test on animals so it is cruelty free which is very important to me. You won't regret it if you try it.
388,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Opened and dried out,I received this product and the seal was broken and the contents dried out it didn’t leak which was a good thing since there were other items in the box.  This product smelled a little off but I’m not sure if that’s the way it really smell or because it’s old.
389,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good haven’t seen any results yet,"What I didn’t like is the first jar had clearly been used, seal broken and some of product missing, so they sent a free replacement and I couldn’t believe it was open too, the protective seal was lifted. Perhaps it happens in transit, not sure what’s going on."
390,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've tried lots of scrubs and this is hands down my favorite.,"The scent is refreshing and not overbearing. The scrub doesn't disintegrate right away when it gets wet and allows you to exfoliate. Doesn't leave an oily layer on your body after rinsing off. With some scrubs you need to use both body wash and scrub to feel clean, but with this scrub it lathers up well and I feel clean after rinsing off.This is the best scrub I have tried yet."
391,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 2nd purchase of! LOVE!!,LOVE this scrub and this brand. The salt to oil ratio is PERFECT!! I've used others and ended up tossing them. Too much oil and large pieces of salt and your tub slick to boot. Ugh. This is perfection and it does not leave the shower all coated in oil. LOVE IT!!
392,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,feels very good!!!,"it leaves my skin feeling very cool, soft, and fairly moisturized. i think when you use it you can't be too stingy with it because it seems to get hard over time quicker than I thought. but I would order again!!! it feels really good and is good for your skin! the cheap scrubs have harmful plastics so beware with what you buy."
393,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hmm,"I would say it moisturizes nicely, however, when it came it didn't seem mixed very well. The top part was quite dry without the oil part. I had to mix it so it would become a better consistency."
394,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are looking for a good scrub, get this one","It smells amazing, scrubs off the dead skin and makes your skin glow beautifully, and is really easy on hands and sensitive skin. And you really feel clean and moisturized at the same time. It's a great scrub"
395,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,I love the scent. Essential oils instead of a synthetic fragrance. Not too heavy. Helps buff away dry skin and leaves skin feeling moisturized. I have sensitive skin and have encountered no problems using this.

397,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not sealed. Which is gross for a shower item.,"Was SO happy to order this because I forgot about it until it showed up in my recommendations. But THEN, I opened it and the seal was not sealed. It's nestled in the lid. Idk if it's been used, but that's a pretty nasty risk to take. Ughhhh."
398,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t like looks of it.,It appeared to be an old product because it was not a smooth consistency and was discolored a bit.  I will go back to other brand
399,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Savior for excessive hand washers,"The scent is incredibly overpowering, but this alone saved my crypt-keeper hands. I have OCD and wash my hands maybe 50+ times a day, so you can imagine the havoc it wreaks on my skin. This has literally restored them to almost as soft and smooth as a baby’s booty!"
400,SheaMoisture Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub for Dull Skin Coconut and Hibiscus Cruelty-Free Skin Care 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Smell, bad packaging","The container itself was busted open, and spilt on my other packages. The inside was very dry, and had little moisture in it. It has a very strong but pleasant smell, after one use my skin felt a lot cleaner, smoother/softer and had a soft sweet coconut scent on it. I would give this product a 5/5 if the packaging was safer for travel - I had 2 containers and the seals were broken on both of them, and the liquid spilt out of both."

You feel cool upon washing off the scrub. Great for a hot day. It does the job and my skin didn’t feel dry.

0,SheaMoisture In-Shower Soap and Body Wash Conditioner for Dry Skin Coconut & Hibiscus Coconut 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, but moisture doesn't absorb.","I was really excited about this in-shower lotion because I love this brand (their baby lotion is great), but I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with it. It doesn't seem to really absorb at all like it's supposed to. It smells great, but is pretty ineffective at moisturizing my dry skin. I will not buy it again."
1,SheaMoisture In-Shower Soap and Body Wash Conditioner for Dry Skin Coconut & Hibiscus Coconut 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving this stuff,"I've been battling incredibly dry, incredibly itchy skin all over for almost a year and it's driving me crazy. I was skeptical of in-shower lotions/moisturizers but I'm willing to try anything at this point and I love the company that makes it. It's not miraculous or life-changing but it's great and honestly exceeded my expectations. I use it last thing in the shower, gently rinse it off, then pat dry with a fluffy towel. It's thick and has a somewhat strong scent during application but after that it fades and leaves me with softer, soothed skin. I'm planning on buying more of this, and the other in-shower conditioners made by SheaMoisture."
2,SheaMoisture In-Shower Soap and Body Wash Conditioner for Dry Skin Coconut & Hibiscus Coconut 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good but generic,"So I have been trying a lot of different in shower conditioners and lotions. This is my second favorite.  (My favorite being soap and glory).I like the way it smells straight out of the bottle and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized. The only thing I don't care for is the generic -ness of the smell,  it just seems a little overdone.... Nice, but nothing special. Think every coconut lotion, ever. I am looking forward to trying this brands other body conditioners."
3,SheaMoisture In-Shower Soap and Body Wash Conditioner for Dry Skin Coconut & Hibiscus Coconut 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sad it didn’t live up to the brand's quality I’m use to,"I’ve been using Shea Moisture products for years now and was confident this would be just as high quality as the rest. Not even close!  As soon as it’s was applied to my skin I noticed a weird almost metallic smell, it doesn’t moisturize the skin at all very disappointed. Although this wasn’t the experience I expected I’ll continue to use the rest of my Shea Moisture products that make my hair happy."
4,SheaMoisture In-Shower Soap and Body Wash Conditioner for Dry Skin Coconut & Hibiscus Coconut 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,"Not what I expected. I thought it would be more of a rich moisturizing body wash, but it doesn’t lather up AT ALL. It’s more like I’m just putting lotion on my body in the shower and not actually cleaning my skin at all"
5,SheaMoisture In-Shower Soap and Body Wash Conditioner for Dry Skin Coconut & Hibiscus Coconut 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not very moisturizing,Not very moisturizing at all and the scent is a little weird. I was disappointed and will stick to Nivea.
6,SheaMoisture In-Shower Soap and Body Wash Conditioner for Dry Skin Coconut & Hibiscus Coconut 8 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels great, smells bad","i feel like some people might lije this scent because it DOES smell like coconut, but idk, for me there was this underlying acidic smell that reminded me of vomit ugh. I wish it didnt have this because it does work!! I feel soft as hell!!!"

0,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed.,"I was very disappointed when I got this product from Amazon. This was my second time using it, the first time I bought it from Walmart and I LOVED it my skin felt amazing! However, the two I bought of here made my skin tingly and caused blemishes  as if I was having an allergic reaction to it. Something was definitely off, like the texture was really silky as if it had been sitting it the warehouse for a long time. I could barely rub it into my skin without it seeping out of my hands. Also, the sent is normally very powerful but not this time it was very mild and I could barely smell it nor did I feel the moisture from the vitamin E once I got out the shower. Overall I am not pleased with this purchase at all and really feel like it was a waste of money especially considering I bought two. For now on, I will continue going to my local Walmart for this body scrub, as I will never order again off Amazon."

I use this to exfoliates before shaving. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth. I especially like it during the winter as it helps combat dry skin.I limit use of this to my legs, feet, arms, hands, and belly. I have sensitive skin, but this scrub doesn't irritate me at all. Note - I don't use it on my chest, back, or face. I don't use it daily and a single container lasts me about 2 to 3months.Now, the downside - the scent. I've been using this scrub for a long while and I've bought it many times. The scent used to be pleasant. The scent is now far more overpowering. It also smells like an artificial fragrance and it's obnoxious. It's a total bummer as I use it much less than I'd like for that reason."
2,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Bad for Shower,"This product is quite abrasive but lubricating for the skin, ""greasy"" in fact. I like it. I prefer the Trader Joe's lavender scrub but refuse to jump through the hoops to get into that store. I had this product dry out when I bought it previously, but in the shower, it got moist again. Given the circumstances in which we are now living, it is preferable to going inside a drugstore."
3,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"I love this product overall. One of my containers (I bought a 2 pack) did not have the seal on it. Well, it did, but it was stuck inside the cap rather than being on the jar as it should have been. There was not sign of prior use, but that jar was a bit drier upon opening than the other making the texture a bit different. Still worked fine, just wish there was some better quality checking"

Both containers were almost totally dry & the box was soaking up the liquid. I would not order a scrub online again since there isn’t a seal or the seal was broken on mine on the tubs each themselves, it was more like one of those foam things under the lid that sits there. It wasn’t sealed tight so leaked out into box."
5,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Eco-friendly, but the scent is so-so","I was looking for an all natural (NO PLASTIC) scrub to tackle ashy feet and exfoliate before shaving. This delivers, although I'm not crazy about the scent as it's a bit strong to me. But, for the amount you get it's a good deal and it's free of plastic microbeads which was the most important criteria for me, personally."
6,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap. Stinks. Fash shipping. Nice seller. Just not for me.,You get what u pay for.. Stinks like a cheap lotion or body spray from the dollar store. Didnt leave my skin moisture at all. It did in the shower but it didn't last long at all. My main issue is the smell. Didnt smell anything like coconut or hibiscus. Im stuck with 2 jars of this stuff now. I hate to throw it away. Not worth sending it back either. Stinks to the high heavens.

I have to wash my hands constantly at work, so dry, cracking hands is a big issue for me. This is Super moisturizing, and I love the way it smells. It’s been the only thing (paired with the regular use of lotion) that helps keep my hands smooth! Definitely would recommend this, and pretty much any other Shea moisture product."

9,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Y’all...EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS,"ONE OF THE BEST BODY SCRUBS EVER. Technically I could make a sugar scrub but it’s not the same as Shea Moisture. It feels like an actual scrub, leaves your skin feeling smooth and glistening. I use about a table spoon portion amount twice daily. This is also great  If you suffer from keratosis pilaris like myself. I noticed a difference almost immediately in the smoothness of my skin AND my condition has improved in less than a week. Boyfriend loves it too, men be crusty too!"

I know it's from this product because I've been getting Brazilians for a year and the only thing that changed was the scrub that I used. I stopped using this one and the problem cleared up. Definitely never buying this again. The scent is about all this scrub has going for it

174,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice Smell, Does Give a Stimulating Scrub","I have used this for over a year now.  I use it only about once a week.  It is invigorating as a scrub, but it is prety crumbly, so I apply very little at a time.  I have not had a problem now that mine is past the expiration date like some are saying below.  Not sure why there are conflicting experiences, it always seem to be that way in reviews.  What I struggle with, is that it seems like scrubbing SUGAR into our skin might not be that good in other ways, other then it gives you a way to invigorate your skin with some minor abraison."
175,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Use within a few months,"When I first bought this product, it was fine. However, be sure to use it within the first few months because it will dry out and get gummy. I tried using it again after it had been in my cabinet for a few months and I threw it away right after. It had separated into granular parts and gummy parts. The gummy parts stuck to my skin and wouldn't come off with water and scrubbing. I had to actually pick small gummy pieces off of my body. I'll stick to the scrub that I personally made instead."

I see slight results and am excited to see the ending result.

179,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pure Body scrub! Real Salt, Real Moisturizer for delicate skin","Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Hand & Body Scrub is AMAZING!It's been at least 15 years since I've found a real salt scrub with moisturizer in it - and I've spent serious money on other products that said they did the same but fell way short.I tend to break out in rashes due to stress and when using this, it didn't irritate my skin while I let it soak in after scrubbing it all over my body, even my face, neck and ears. After gently drying off, my skin wasn't too slippery or slick, it had soaked the moisturizer to just the right level.Since I have delicate skin especially coming out of winter this is perfect and know it will be the same in summer after working outside.If you have any type of skin issues I highly recommend Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Hand & Body Scrub. I did order and wash with the Shea Moisture Face and Body Bar (African Black Soap) first and my skin is healing and feels smooth without flaking or itching.My Granddaughter could use this so I'm going to order for her as well, the ingredients are pure so not worried about either one of us having a reaction.Cannot recommend this enough!"
180,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase ever!,"Best body scrub ever! I have had a lot of body scrubs that have too much olive oil and it makes the shower slimy. This one is kinda dry until you wet it. It leaves just the right amount of moisture on you, so you don’t feel like an oil slick. The smell is wonderful! My daughter loves it too, so I’ve already ordered more. It’s been one of my favorite Amazon purchases."
181,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Nope,"Makes me nauseous (subjective).  Objectively this does not exfoliate- this shouldn’t be called a scrub.  This doesn’t even moisturize, it coats your skin and rubs off on every fabric and piece of furniture you own.  I would just go back to exfoliating with baking soda and moisturizing with coconut oil.  Its smells like and feels like cheap candle wax."
182,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t stand the smell.,"I’m not sure this product is authentic. My roommate got some from Walgreens and it smelled great, contained a lot of oil in the mixture and was extremely moisturizing. This stuff smells awful, and feels like it only moisturizes about 1/4th as much as the one from Walgreens did. The whole product consistency and scent seems off. I’m really regretting using this in the shower because now it’s all I can smell and want to vomit. I don’t even know how to explain the scent other than gross. It’s kind of a chemical smell like how some clothes or other items off Amazon smell sometimes. I seriously feel like I’m going to have to soak myself in tomato juice like they do to get skunk smell out just to get this nauseating scent out of my skin."
183,"Shea Moisture Skin Care, Coconut & Hibiscus Illuminating Hand and Body Scrub, Gluten Free Vitamin E, Restores Radiant Healthy Glow to Dull Skin, 2 jars - 12 oz ea.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very rough on the skin, dries out quickly",Shocked this gets such good reviews. It is way too rough and I don't think I have particularly sensitive skin. Particles are way too big and feels uncomfortable. Did not hydrate my legs at all and after one use it was too dry to use even though the lid was shut very tight. I had to add jojoba oil to it to use it. Would not buy again.

It smells wonderful, like a pina colada. It exfoliates your skin and makes it super soft. I will say, it moisturizes by leaving a fairly thick hydrophobic residue on top of your skin, so this might bother some people. Because it is such an intense moisturizer, I like to use it on my feet. If you are looking for something more sheer, I would not recommend this product."

0,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Dead Sea Salt Muscle Relief Mineral Soak for Unisex, 20 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,smells bad (like really fake) and has stuff other than salt in it,"it smells nothing like coconut and hibiscus, and trust me i'm not sensitive at all to smells but this is the 2nd shea moisture product ive used and i cant say either product i bought i was happy with at all (the other is that coconut lotion that literally does not come out of the bottle). i love strong smells usually but this smells... off. and i don't like it, it smells very synthetic and gross. the other issue is that idk what else is in here besides salt but there are little brown pieces that i dont like floating around the bathtub, looks like rocks or something, i dont know but it made me like the product less too. probably wont be buying another shea moisture product, i dont get the hype. im sticking to l'occitane, dr. teal's, and kneipp bath products."
1,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Dead Sea Salt Muscle Relief Mineral Soak for Unisex, 20 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best scent possible!! A MUST try for regular bath takers! But a bit pricey..,"This smells AMAZING!! It's a floral, fresh scent that just melts into the hot bath. Ultra moisturizing! On my 1st use, I immediately thought that all of my friends and family, the fellow bath taker ones, ABSOLUTELY NEED to try this!!... I thought of buying more to give as presents but it's kinda of expensive for a small/ medium sized jar. A bit pricey but the story of the history is nicely written on the product. I am definitely going to buy more.. but only when I want to splurge on myself and I'm trying to make my jar last as long as possible. LOVE THIS!! Please make it a little cheaper so I can buy more on the regular. Favorite new bath time soak!! Smells amazing, feels amazing, immediate results!!"

3,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Dead Sea Salt Muscle Relief Mineral Soak for Unisex, 20 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,luxury plus...Go ahead...treat yourself!,"Love this stuff, and cannot find it anywhere locally, at any price.  I have a 2-person spa tub, and so I use this sparingly, mixed in with generous helping of regular epsom salts.  I get about 4-5 soaks from one jar, and it still provides that wonderful Shea Moisture coconut-hibiscus."
4,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Dead Sea Salt Muscle Relief Mineral Soak for Unisex, 20 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely LOVE this stuff,"I absolutely LOVE this stuff!  I soak almost every day, and this is my favorite!  It makes the water soft and moisturizes my skin, so if I feel the need to escape to my tub for more than 20 minutes, it won't dry me out.  The scent is so relaxing!  I'll definitely buy more!"

7,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Dead Sea Salt Muscle Relief Mineral Soak for Unisex, 20 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,Have to chisel the salt out.,I’m disappointed that when I opened the jar it was hard as a rock.

10,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Dead Sea Salt Muscle Relief Mineral Soak for Unisex, 20 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Amazing,I love this product!  The smell is awesome.  Not sure about the moisturizing quality as I tend to always moisturize after a bath.

17,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Dead Sea Salt Muscle Relief Mineral Soak for Unisex, 20 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great moisture, very sweet smell","I normally use straight-up Epsom salts, which can be drying, so this moisturizing soak was a nice change. Not adds moisture with no slick, greasy residue--none in the tub, none on your body. However, I'd order a different scent next time. The coconut & hibiscus combo was more cloying than tropical."

38,"Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Dead Sea Salt Muscle Relief Mineral Soak for Unisex, 20 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,Had to chisel to loosen up the salts,I am giving this product a 3 because it is the average of my experience so far with this product; would give a 2.5 if I could but rounding up versus down because I love the scent and feel in the bath. My daughter gave me my first jar for Mothers Day and I loved it so much I ordered another when I used it up. However I opened the jar last night and was surprised to see that the salts were hard and I had to chisel at it to loosen up some to put in the bath. When trying to insert a knife down through I meet resistence which tells me I will need to continue to chisel away every time I use it. In contrast I had no issue with just scooping in with my hand and grabbing some from the first jar (or the other one I bought at the same time as this one in the Lavendar & Wild Orchis scent). I do know the two scents were sent from two locations so don't know if that had something to do with it. So be aware that there may be inconsistency with the quality of this product which has been my experience so far out of two jars.

Since I'm currently 8 months pregnant and plan on breastfeeding, guess I won't be using this for about a year (I'm taking the conservative precaution, but ask your doctor). I'm guessing since it's not tested on animals, that's probably why they have that on the label."

The scent IS potent but I never fill the bath much more than up to my thigh so its not like right in my face.

It definitely helped relax sore muscles better than regular Epsom and my skin is so smooth right now!"
