0,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,good for low porosity curls,"Ok 1. for ppl saying ‚Äúdescription says 16 bottles‚Äù lol what? It says dual pack, 15oz ..dual means two and idk where anyone would think they‚Äôd get 16 if anything for $16. dont review poorly because you lack reading comprehension2. this smells amazing and makes my hair SO soft. but if u have high porosity hair u will have to add protein"
1,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First time use - good results, bad price","***Edit***I'm editing my original review because of something I just learned. Being new to CGM and the different products, I didn't realize that the price on this product was higher than it should have been. While visiting my local Walgreens, I found the exact same brand and sized bottles, 16 Oz, for $8 a piece. This seller is gouging customers by charging $30+ for the set! Absolutely unacceptable and while I will definitelycontinueusing the product, I will never purchase from this seller .***Smells really great without being too strong. After my first use, I was very happy with the curl outcome and will continue using. My only complaint is regarding the packaging. The pump is way too short and doesn't give enough product at one time. The product itself is great."
2,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Description says 16 bottles, but only got 2","This description said you would get 8 shampoos and 8 conditioners. So I paid the huge price for it. When it came, there was only one shampoo and one conditioner, and both pumps on the bottles were broken off. The description clearly says 16 bottles, and I would never have paid so much money for two bottles. Infuriating"
3,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and great value!!,"I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is so soft and moisturized after using it. I also love the scent!!! 10/10 recommend - great product foe the price.After following the curly girl method for about a year, I‚Äôve come to a routine where I wash with the shampoo, rinse, rake conditioner through my hair, brush conditioner, and squish to condition (leaving most of the conditioner in my hair). I love the results! I won‚Äôt go back to any other shampoo I‚Äôve tried before.I hope this helps!!"
4,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product but the pumps could be A LOT better,"I have wavy hair and I have been embracing the texture recently and using products that amp up the curl factor. I really love this shampoo/conditioner set. It smells amazing and it brings out my curls. My only issue is that the conditioner pump was broken when it arrived. I have to just take the lid off and squeeze it out during my showers. It wasn't worth it to me to try and send it back but it is an annoyance. The pumps themselves feel pretty cheap so I am not surprised that one failed before it even arrived. That being said, I do really like the product itself and I will probably continue to buy it, hopefully the next set works properly."
5,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly girl method approved,Have been trying to do the curly girl method and these to products are approved and make my hair look great. I can get beautiful clumps of curls without having yucky buildup on my hair.
6,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,...,Item description clearly states 16 COUNT.  Only recieved 2. Never would have paid 34 dollars for this product.  It is a very good product but not good enough to be mislead by seller in description.
7,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not ""natural ingredients"" and shampoo strips all the moisture","I'd skip the shampoo and find a more moisturizing one if you've got curlies. I'm unsure what I expected, it says natural but it's ""natural"" meaning, nah, bb this is all chemicals with a nice scent.It smells nice but I'm pretty sure I just spent $40 on drug store product. The shampoo completely strips my hair to the point it feels like straw and the conditioner works well...but would it work better if the poo didn't strip? Probably. Is it thick? I guess? Feels about the same as anything.I'm disappointed and I'll probably move this along to someone else."
8,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing no protein,"So this shampoo and conditioner is great for people who are protein sensitive and need a lot of moisture. That is not me. I need a decent amount of protein in my routine and 2 months after purchasing my hair was over moisturized and lost a lot of volume. This is definitely a case of my hair not responding well to a good product and not that the product is bad. I would recommend this to anyone who is in protein overload or is protein sensitive, this is just not for me"
9,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great curl defining shampoo and conditioner!,"I have wavy, frizzy hair. When I started using this shampoo and conditioner I was a skeptic. Each time I wash my hair with Not Your Mother‚Äôs Naturals Curl Defining products I get luscious curls without frizz. It‚Äôs magical! I‚Äôve never liked my hair down and natural but now I love it! My curls are so pretty and I no longer feel as though I have to wear my hair up in a ponytail to mask the kinkiness and waves."
10,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,So worth it!,Besides going to the salon to get your hair done I swear to you it's the best shampoo and conditioner I ever bought üòå I'm so unbelievably happy with how my hair feels after a wash.. Also this is a great foaming shampoo unlike most where it feels like it just sits there. This feels like it goes right to my scalp making it feel oh so good... I could really go on and on but Give it a try you won't be disappointed I promise you.. i got the set for Curl Defining
11,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,Conditioner is weak,"The shampoo is really nice, lightly floral and fruity scented, slightly moisturizing.The conditioner is a flop, the consistency is a lot thinner than most conditioners. It feels like water and is barely even useful to detangle my hair in the shower. I tried letting it sit in my hair for a few minutes while washing up and it kinda just washes off really fast without feeling like it did anything. Found myself struggling to detangle my curls in the shower which is bad for a product meant for curly hair.Would recommend if you have thin of fine hair  since it's light weight and non greasy. Unfortunately if you have curly hair I'd recommend just getting the shampoo and finding a different conditioner."
12,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Did nothing for my curls,"In fact, this made my hair much worse. I have more split ends than I‚Äôve ever had. It just doesn‚Äôt moisturize in a good way. In the shower it feels nice, sure. Feels like my hair will get moisture. The conditioner is really heavy, but once rinsed out it gave my hair a sort of heavy and dry feeling. I have very wavy asian mixed hair. The smell is nice, but would not buy again. The amount of buildup this combo gave me was insane. I usually wash my hair every 3 days, but needed a daily wash with this."
13,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading description! Not as advertised!,"This ad is fraudulent and misleading. It clearly states a 16 count which means 8 shampoos and 8 conditioners. I received two items. $35 for two bottles of over-the-counter shampoo and conditioner which retail for about $5 or $6 a piece, is price scouging. I love this product, but I will not pay astronomical prices for it. The seller is completely unethical, completely misleading and this should be taken down or updated immediately."
14,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only stuff that works on our hair,"I have had annoying to handle curls/waves all my life and being married and having to cover my hair... I'm grateful lol bc i hated dealing with it. We have two toddlers with very beautiful,curly hair. Their hair gets knotty and this brand has a detangler which is the only effective detangler we've found, so i tried this and i don't even need the detangler most times. This makes their curls so bouncy and defined. Love this brand"
15,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,conditioner has AMAZING slip !!,I don't usually ever write reviews but this product is AMAZING !! I have 3b/3c hair and have never  detangled my hair so fast and easily as with this conditioner. I haven't tried the shampoo yet but I am super excited for my next wash !! Definitely recommend this brand and product for ALL hair types !! also cgm approved :))
16,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of a let down,"So many people following the curly girl method have recommended this shampoo and conditioner that I had to try it. I just wasn't impressed. It left my waves flat and lifeless. Also, I expected this stuff to smell amazing. The scent of the shampoo was very faint floral and the conditioner lacked a scent but somehow managed to smell bad. It's almost as though they forgot to put the scent in the mixture before bottling it. What a let down. I only used it a few times before throwing the bottles away."
17,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Super greasy hair,The product has a great smell and the shampoo works pretty well...it's the conditioner that's the issue.  There is no happy medium...if you don't rinse enough then you have this greasy weird residue in your hair that looks like you didn't wash it. If you rinse too much then it is like you have no conditioner at all. It does not work for my hair at all. I can't stand the feeling of being able to still feel the conditioner in my hair like gel.
18,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I have a lot of skin allergies and so there really isn't that many shampoos i can use. I had used another shampoo in this brand but the price had tripled so I found this set. It smells so good. I don't have curly hair at all - it's very straight but idc. Imma gonna use it anyways. Ha
19,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great everyday wash,Working in a hospital and having curly hair is a difficult balancing act when it comes to frizzy dry hair. I love the smell and fact that I can fully wash my hair everyday without it drying out or getting all frizzy. Nice light scent too. Also if you follow a low poo/cg method these are perfect.
20,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for thin curly hair,Just started my curl journey to better my curls and create healthier hair..well this product got me off to a great start! It is lightweight and allows for my thin hair to have more curl without all the heavy product weighing it down which was causing my curls to be non-existent. I bought this product one year ago and I am just now needing a new bottle. A whole year for one shampoo/conditioner bottle... definitely a great value for my money. Yes I am washing my hair about every 3-4 days. The smell is faint and not too strong for those wondering and I have a super smeller nose so it doesn't bother me at all. Great product! Super approved!
21,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Drying,This dried my hair out so bad and smells like chemicals.

It has bought life back into my curly hair again and I love the light scent. It's just right not too strong of a scent. I will definitely tell my friends or anyone about this wonderful stuff. Gonna be a forever customer.

29,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,It didn't work for me as expected,It smellsok ..

34,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,The conditioner smells bad to me.,I love the shampoo! Smells great takes a little more to get it lathered but works good. The conditioner on the other hand smells terrible and it's always right after I start rinsing. It smells ok in the bottle and on my hand but the min I go to wash it out of my hair it reeks. I bought another kind of Not Your Mother's products and have had no issues with it.

36,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Packaging SUCKS,"The fact that the packaging came like this is upsetting. They could‚Äôve done a better job securing it so it wouldn‚Äôt spill. That‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars. Other than that, I love this shampoo & Conditioner. I have wavy, very frizzy hair & this is the in shampoo that keeps it moisturized and less frizzy. Also, my hair doesn‚Äôt fall out like other products I‚Äôve tried.Hope that helps! (:"

47,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"Expensive price for two small bottles. The scent is overly sweet (almost like bubble gum or candy). I purchased on scent alone, and the fact that this brand is cruelty-free. I have wavy hair, not curly‚Ä¶ so maybe that‚Äôs why I found it does nothing special for my hair. I‚Äôll be switching."

Cheap packaging and to prevent the fluids from leaking they put packaging tape around the bottles.

It smells really good. My hair felt mousitrized and my curls were more defined after one use.
101,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Great
102,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for fine-textured hair; good alternative to silicone,"As you'd expect from NYM, it's a well-formulated product. Pleasant to use, smells nice, etc. The conditioner leaves a good occlusive film on the hair and is great at controlling winter static and frizz. I would say it's a medium-heavy conditioner because it takes a LOT of rinsing if you don't want a heavy film, and I've taken to thinning it with water before applying it to my ends because it is just Too Much for my fine-textured hair. Even so, it weighs my strands down pretty badly and makes my curls look really terrible, so I don't use it on days when I wear my curls naturally. I would only recommend it for people with stiffer hair strands and probably a tighter curl pattern.If you like the way silicone conditioners affect your hair, this is a good alternative. The quaternium ingredient provides a very similar slippery feel to the hair and would help make tangles etc more manageable. The advantage is there is no build-up, the effects wash out even with sulfate-free shampoo. However, if you do not like the way silicone conditioners feel in your hair (as I don't) this is not the product for you. It makes my hair feel like plasticy barbie doll hair in exactly the same way dimethicone does. Yuck!"
103,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,CHUNKS of hair falling out!,DO NOT BUY THIS! I lost over 50% of my hair from this product! I am devastated! I had beautiful thick hair and within a month of using the shampoo and conditioner all my hair began falling out IN CHUNKS!!!! I barely have any hair left. You can see through my hair and I have thinning and balding throughout all of my hair. This product was the only think that changed in the month of us. My hair is thin and at this point I may have to shave my hair off. I am not being dramatic. I have cried everyday since discovering this was the issue. I stopped using this product and within a week the hair loss stopped!
104,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pump WTH? Shampoo the bomb,"I love this shampoo. The price doesn't bother me if it does what I want and I like the smell. I read reviews about the pump and thought, ""ok, dumb. Review the product not the pump"", but OH MY GAAWD the pump is the worst. How is anyone suppose to get shampoo out of it? I had to take an old squeeze lid and replace pump. Just a tip for the next person. Shampoo 5 star, pump -1, bringing my review down to a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
105,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,I thought my hair was fried,"I bought this shampoo so I could stop using drug store brands. I loved it! It made my hair soft and smelled so nice. But when my hair dried, it had a weird texture and felt like hay. I thought maybe my hair started to get fried from hot tools or maybe dying my hair too much. I changed my routine and couldn‚Äôt figure out why my hair texture changed over night. I couldn‚Äôt style it, it would be clumped in knots seconds after brushing through, it was heartbreaking. I decided to use a different shampoo one day, and walla! My hair was back to normal. I threw this shampoo out immediately after."
106,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work well for 3c hair,This left my curls pretty flat. Did not moisturize very well. I have ringlet curls and I do not need heavy moisturizing but this was so light that my hair would be frizzy just hours after dry. I also do not like the scent. It barely smells like anything at all and doesn't last either. I would not buy this again.
107,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, horrible pumps. Too Expensive!",I love this product; BUT the pumps are ALWAYS broken even when I was able to buy this in the store still.

108,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,No Bueno.,The pumps suck. And the conditioner was like glue.. it wouldn‚Äôt come off! My time in the shower was literally doubled. Only positive thing I can say about this product is that it smells really good.

110,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Grimy & curl enhancing ish,I've always had soft and silky hair. After a severely short hair cut 2 years ago it has started creating these spiral curls. I have been trying curl embracing products to try to help encourage the curl with my silly hair.I've only used this product 3-4 times but my hair feels dirty and grimy all of the time now. It's impossible to brush after when dry and constantly tangles now. These were never problems that I had before.I'm not sure what to do with this product but I don't think I will be counting use anymore.

125,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just awful,This is not for curly hair.

129,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite hair conditioner,"I have not found another that detangles my hair as good as this! It makes it easy to cowash, very moisturizing and lots of slip! It smells good but very strong and does triggers my headaches. It don‚Äôt stop me from using it though! That‚Äôs how good it is."
130,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Rancid shampoo and plastic conditioner,"I wish I was allowed to return this item, but apparently when I ordered it as a subscription you can't return things. I opened it up and the shampoo smells rancid. Definitely not anything floral or tropical that I was expecting. The conditioner (which should smell the same) smells like plastic or latex. Again, not floral, tropical, or even good. I'm hoping it's a bad batch I was given that was expired, since I've used other NYM products and not had this problem. Guess I'll go to the drugstore and buy it in person where I can smell if it's gone bad. I certainly won't buy from this supplier again."
131,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible for my Hair,"I have other products from NYM‚Äôs that I love, but this particular shampoo and conditioner were terrible on my hair!

0,Not Your Mother's Naturals Repair & Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon - Rejuvenate Damaged Hair,1.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair disgusting,"I typically use biolage shampoo and conditioner and if I go the cheap route I usually use tresseme but I love NYM hairspray and purple shampoo so I thought I'd give this a try. It was awful! I only wash my hair once or twice a week and I have for many years. My hair doesn't get oily ever. I could go weeks without washing before it starts to show evidence of oil but even washing my hair one time with this stuff it made it so greasy! After a few weeks of using it once or twice a week I had this thick layer of I don't even know what... Just pure disgusting-ness, that made it look like I hadn't washed my hair in months. I couldn't run my fingers through my hair and if I would lay on my hair it would stay in that same place until I straightened it. I kept thinking it was something I was doing at first so I wasn't realizing it was the shampoo (thinking ok maybe I didn't wash it out all the way, maybe I left conditioner on too long, maybe I didn't wash it well enough, things like that) so that was why I kept on using it until I finally realized it was definitely the shampoo and conditioner. I finally changed to a different shampoo and after two washes with a different shampoo my hair was soft and beautiful again. It was like I had to wash layers of this icky film of gunk off my hair. Definitely put it in the trash. Never had this happen with any other shampoo/conditioner"
1,Not Your Mother's Naturals Repair & Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon - Rejuvenate Damaged Hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing stuff,"I have red, curly hair which tends to be course and frizzy.  About two months ago, I started using the curly girl method, so I got this shampoo because it met the requirements.  My hair has truly been transformed by this shampoo!  My hair is completely frizz free and shiny.  It never feels weighed down and it looks completely different. So glad I found this stuff. Highly recommend the honey version!!! üíØ"
2,Not Your Mother's Naturals Repair & Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon - Rejuvenate Damaged Hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair feels so soft,I‚Äôm a first time mom going through my postpartum period. My hair was very brittle and dry due to the over processing my hair and dying over it. Once I cut my hair I bought this and it has made my hair feel so soft and smell so good. I normally use two applications of shampoo. The pump is a little tough to push down as you only get a small amount out with one pump and it springs back up slowly.
3,Not Your Mother's Naturals Repair & Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon - Rejuvenate Damaged Hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lathered well,Love the way this shampoo and conditioner smells! I try to use the most natural products on my hair but let's be honest some of those products don't work to cleanser your hair as good. Well this does lather good!
4,Not Your Mother's Naturals Repair & Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon - Rejuvenate Damaged Hair,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Itchy scalp, not that great","I think I might be allergic to an ingredient in this because it made my scalp very itchy and flaky. Also, the shampoo smelled like generic hand soap to me and I'm not completely unconvinced that it wasn't emptied and refilled with cheap shampoo. The bottle was only 3/4 full and it's not the quality that I'm used to from Not Your Mother's. Overall I'm pretty disappointed especially because this was more pricey and I won't be able to finish the bottle because my scalp is just so itchy."
5,Not Your Mother's Naturals Repair & Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon - Rejuvenate Damaged Hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,Considerable improvement,So I'm currently losing my hair because of chemotherapy. And I was looking for something that could at least help with the hair I have left. I can honestly say since switching to not your mother's I have seen my hair improve. I highly recommend it.
6,Not Your Mother's Naturals Repair & Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon - Rejuvenate Damaged Hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing hair product!!,"My hairdresser recommended this product to me and my hair has never felt so healthy.  I have been using it for around 6 months and I love how nourished and hydrated my hair looks and feels!  I have coarse, naturally wavy hair and with other products my hair dried out quickly and I always had split ends.  This is a game changer.  No split ends and I love how it feels!!!"

Which is a weird way to describe either but that's the only way. The conditioner is favorite! This is my second bottle.

28,Not Your Mother's Naturals Repair & Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon - Rejuvenate Damaged Hair,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dried out my hair, will not buy again","I had bought this shampoo a year or so ago and remembered having pretry decent results for my long, thick curly hair.  They must have changed something other than the packaging, because my hair is worse off than before I started (the first time I bought the set, it was in plastic bottles instead of metal ones).I am not going to lie, I am a minimalist and quite lazy when it comes to taking care of my hair and I bought this set because I was running low and liked my previous results.  This time around, my hair became frizzy, dry, and my curls lost all definition.  If I used the set several days in a row, my hair had a gross texture that was somehow chalky and gummy?  I threw away the set after 10 days of damaging my hair that hopefully can be reversed."

0,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,THE BEST,"This was the first time I used this product & I will never go back! I have semi thick, curly hair that hasn‚Äôt curled to the scalp since I was in my 20s before I had my daughter. Happy to report that after I let my hair naturally dry, my curls spring from my scalp like in my youth! I looove this product! I‚Äôm going to have to see if they have a hair serum or after product because man, my hair would be even more rockin!"
1,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A great combo!,This shampoo and conditioner are CGM approved! They are such a great combination for my dry hair. I‚Äôm definitely loving that it gives just enough moisture without leaving me feeling greasy.
2,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I spent $15.00 dollars on a great shampoo and conditioner that had damaged pumps.,This is a great brand and I love the smell. Far better than the original line of Not Your Mothers! But both pumps did not work after I started using them. It's a complete pain in the butt to have to return a product after you buy it and paid decent money for it. I should have returned them or maybe.... they shouldn't have damaged product out for sale! (P. S.) I did follow the directions on how to open correctly and the price of replacement pumps is not worth it. )
3,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Such a nice change!,"My bestfriends daughter introduced me to this brand. I was paying way too much money for my Redken products and wearing my hair naturally, it still frizzed. I started using 'Not your mother's naturals and noticed a big difference from the first use. I don't need to use my expensive (before hair drying) serum any longer, which is saving me more money. Also, I had no problems with the pumps and this shampoo and conditioner smells amazing! I recommend."
4,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Less than a one star.,Junk. Leaves your hair with a film and smells like the cheap plastic bottle it came in.
5,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible Scent,This has a terrible offputting scent and the pump bottle for the conditioner I got was broken upon arrival. Not the best Not your mothers.
6,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Pumps hard/impossible to open,"I haven‚Äôt used it yet because I can‚Äôt get the pumps open. I had to rinse and dry one just to open it from the inside. The other one still won‚Äôt open. I saw a lot of reviews like this and sadly, I did not listen."
7,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing,"I have only used this once, but it has a yummy creamy Coconut scent that has stayed in my hair for 3 days even through other products. Great price for the quantity too!i can't say much about the effect on my hair as it's only been one wash, but it felt really silky when I was applying :)"
8,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dries out your hair,Used for 3 days and my hair was very noticeably dry.

9,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, not great for my scalp","I liked this product at first, but then it started to give me dandruff"
10,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,The pump doesn‚Äôt work,I like the shampoo and conditioner. It was moisturizing and smelled great.  I would probably even keep buying them if the pump worked. I can‚Äôt get the pump on either bottle to work and there was some conditioner spillage during shipping.
11,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best,"I was excited to try this set because of all of the good reviews. The pumps on both the shampoo and conditioner bottles arrived broken, and the product left a weird residue in my hair. I used it for a few days to see if it would get better but no luck. I went back to my normal shampoo and conditioner and it took several days to get rid of the stickiness/residue."
12,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair loves me :),Great feel for my hair! Helps with frizz and doesn't weigh my locks down. Great scent!
13,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE,"I usually buy the coconut milk & african marula oil from NYM official brand website and it‚Äôs extremely moisturizing. My hair loves it and people I recommended it to, loved it. When I saw that it was cheaper on Amazon, I bought it but it dried my hair and caused dandruff. These must be really old or a scam."
14,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Coconut Milk & Marula Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 16 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,best on the market,"seriously this stuff is the best, must be that Marula oil."

0,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,2.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult to open,The smell is to die for and my hair feels amazing. But somebody PLEASE tell me how to pop the top? I spent at least 10 minute struggling with this in the shower before I whacked it it off the tub a couple times out of frustration. Thing finally popped up but what a headache. And what's funny is the product was leaked out from the top not being screwed on tight. Good product but they need to fix the bottle.UPDATE: I have been using this for a while and quickly started to notice that it seemed like i was shedding more hair than usual. So for a week or two I went back to my old shampoo/conditioner and my hair seemed fine. Went back to not your mothers again....and hair was covering my shower floor. I wanted to like this for its smell and squeaky clean but I think what ever chemicals are in this is too harsh for my hair.
1,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great,Nothing irritates me more than when you buy an item with a pump and the pump doesn't work.  The shampoo and conditioner are very thick and hard to distribute through your hair. It smelled good but the smell doesn't last very long. Also after washing my hair it felt very dry and damaged.  I only used for a little over a week. I will probably just use this stuff to shave my legs or something. I would definitely NOT recommend this product. Not worth the money.
2,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Lightweight Shampoo/Conditioner,"I‚Äôm really happy with this shampoo. I was looking for something that cleansed well and moisturized without weighing my fine hair down, and this does it for me. My only complaint is that it took me days to get the conditioner pump to work correctly."
3,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the product.  Hate the pump.,Great shampoo and conditioner.  Smells good.  Detangles my knotty hair.  Love it. But I hate the pumps. One pump broke so we have to take off the top and the teens never put it back on so it dumps and gets water in it. The other pump takes a few seconds to pop back up.  A bit irritating.  Could be because both shampoo and conditioner are really thick- which I love.  I have already bought again.  Hoping pump is an oops.  I love all the products I have bought from ‚Äúnot your mothers‚Äù so I‚Äôll just hope my next pumps work better.
4,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bounce and Non-Oily,"I love the way my hair feels after I wash it. There is some bounce and I can go a couple of days between washings because it doesn't get oily. The scent threw me off a little the first time or two, but now I don't really notice it. It reminds me of a powder I used to smell on older ladies who wore Avon perfume when I was a kid. Overall, 5 stars."
5,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sent different set,"Wish I could review this scent/combo, but we were sent the Blood Orange & Black Currant set. We were literally out of shampoo & conditioner, so we kept it. The pumps were both broken (we just used our empty bottle ones), and I feel like the shampoo is too thick & doesn‚Äôt pump properly. Long story short, I won‚Äôt ‚Äúbuy‚Äù the blood Orange set again and hope if I order this, this one is actually sent this time. (We love the Apple Blossom & Green Tea‚Ä¶maybe we should just stick with that). ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
6,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,1.0 out of 5 stars,Expired and very dehydrating,"Returned after a few uses, because my hair went from soft to dry as straw. I started wondering if maybe it was expired, and so I took a look at the bottle. The company who sold it took white out and covered everything up. I scratched it off and did some research and realized that it was, in fact, expired. Nice try trying to fool customers, though."
7,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,4.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe not for dry prone hair,"The product is good and smells great. I tried it because it is recommended for curly girl hair. However, my scalp and hair tend to be dry, and this product seemed to dry it out more."
8,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair Loss,"So, I‚Äôm a big fan of NYM products and this is the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced hair loss from their products.

10,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchase this,Cheaper then target and love the way it smells. Makes my hair feel very soft
11,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smell good,"These clean my hair and smell great, but the scent is STRONG. If you are scent sensitive these are not for you because it lasts for days. I have oily hair and I find myself needing to wash sooner using this set than other brands, but it feels clean and moisturized each time I wash. This particular duo may be better for normal to dry hair. I would buy this brand again in another combination to try next time for myself."
12,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,4.0 out of 5 stars,Inconveniently Difficult Shampoo Container,"The shampoo is really thick so it doesn‚Äôt really even come out like at all, for my thick hair. I use a decent amount of this shampoo to actually be able to lather it, but this container doesn‚Äôt work wonders for the shampoo.What‚Äôs inside the bottle is a dream!!! Moisturizer, and after a months use my hair has grown more than it did on Function of Beauty!! That and the scent is very strong but I love the orange!!! üíñ"
13,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,1.0 out of 5 stars,I received the wrong shampoo and it was nothing special,I got the wrong kind. I ordered the aquatic mint or whatever and I got the Sicilian orange one‚Ä¶ I figured I‚Äôd give it a go since I ordered it to our new house while moving & on the road. I didn‚Äôt have the energy after driving cross country to do yet another Amazon return. Sooo I suppose I‚Äôm reviewing the orange one‚Ä¶ I do not suggest it‚Ä¶. Doesn‚Äôt smell great and has done nothing for my hair. Invest in a more quality  duo‚Ä¶
14,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pumps don‚Äôt work!!!,"Both pumps wouldn‚Äôt open. Super annoying! They are in my shower with the whole lid off, just so I can get to the dang product. Which isn‚Äôt even that good. I find it drying, the smell is just ok. It is not worth the hassle of sending them back. I‚Äôll never buy their products again though."
15,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice Scent, Good Moisture","According to my wife: Nice smell and with long hair, can easily brush out with no tangle after a shower. Does it‚Äôs job with moisture. The shampoo has a super nice lather. The pumps SUCKED. Had to dig through the recycling to get the caps of the previous shampoo and conditioner and replace."

106,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,2.0 out of 5 stars,Nah,It has nothing to do with making your hair softer. Hair gets so stuck that your hands can't go thru to wash properly. Also gives dehydrating feeling.
107,Not Your Mother's Naturals Weightless Hydration Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water - Hydration to Revitalize Hair,4.0 out of 5 stars,The caps broke immediately but the product is excellent,Using Not Your Mother's product for about 4 months has given me so much new hair and it's so much fuller and has so much more body. The shampoo does not larger as much as regular shampoo so you have to use a little more. Just shampoo your scalp. The conditioner is great but I don't use it on scalp. I'll never use another product

They smell good but the scent doesn't stay in your hair after you rinse it out. And if you have even the slightest dandruff, you'll regret using this. I've used the NYM Blonde Moment shampoo and loved it, so I thought I'd try more of their products and I wish I hadn't.Serious waste of money."

0,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Dear customer, & Dear Not Your Mother‚Äôs-","I really adore this shampoo and conditioner. So much so, that when I unexpectedly run out I generally frantically search the nearest Target, Walgreens, CVS.. you name it.It tames the wild & frizzy Hagrid mane that I have, turning it into defined beach waves that I get endless compliments on. For that, I am eternally grateful and LOYAL.SO LOYAL, that I am willing to pull out MY TOOLBOX every time I receive a new bottle. So, to Not Your Mothers- THANK YOU for a fantastic and all natural product. NO THANK YOU for the completely functionless ‚Äútwist to unlock‚Äù feature. Bro. Figure it out."
1,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaging,"BE CAREFUL! I am actually shocked after really all the reviews on how good these are. AWFUL, and that's saying a lot because I never write reviews. I have straight/wavy hair and after I used them my hair was limp and extremely DRY; so dry that it was actually getting tangled, and my hair never gets tangled. Usually I put braids in my hair to have waves in my hair; however, my hair would no longer hold a curl. I have never had a shampoo do this before. They smell really good but the fragrance is pretty hight up on the ingredient list which has something to with the dryness because the scent is very strong."
2,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely adding this to My Holy Grail of Products.,"I used the mask first before trying the shampoo and conditioner, and the mask was wonderful so I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner and it didn't disappoint. I have 3b/3c curls and they have been dry and in need of nutrients and this was awesome. To me it smells really good too, not over powering. I feel that this will be something that I can use no matter the season. It's not too heavy for summer but yet provide good nutrients for winter."
3,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves residue,Shampoo pump broken. But that's okay. Smell is good. But leaves behind a very tacky residue on my hair. And yes I rinse my hair thoroughly. Washed my hair twice with the shampoo and conditioner got tacky results both times. My hair is very long 40inch. ++. Not risking my hair with this brand. Throwing it away and buying something else. There was also a residue left behind in the tub. Like grease maybe from the vegetable and almond oil in the conditioner. Idk. Dont recommend.
4,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fabulous shampoo and conditioner--HORRIBLE spout top, again!","If you love the rage that ensues from having to unscrew the pump top of your shampoo and conditioner to get your product out every time you wash your hair, this shampoo and conditioner set is for you. What's ironic is that NYMN redesigned the bottle shape--it even says so on the packaging. Somehow the completely dysfunctional spout top from the last design was kept, so the pump does not work. I've been using these products for about 3 years and with the last design, I could get about 50% of the pump tops to work (after a ton of aggravation). This is my first set of the ""new design,"" and neither my husband nor I could get the dang thing to work. I do love the shampoo and conditioner so much. It's great for curly hair, awesome consistency, and smells like heaven. However, I am OVER the dysfunctional pump top. It might be goodbye to NYMN products for me."
5,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pumps broken but great products,Product is great. I love the smell and how it makes my hair feel. The only issue is that the pumps were broken so I have to remove the tops and squeeze it out. Just a hassle. Maybe buying in store would be better.
6,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"Really wanted to love this but the fragrance is too strong, it makes my hair straw like and you have to buy it in these huge bottles so you pay for the quantity."
7,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bad pumps,"A friend of mine had this stuff and the product is amazing and smells so good. Unfortunately this specific set of the product has defective pumps. I could not for the life of me open the shampoo pump and ordered a replacement. The replacement came and both pumps weren‚Äôt opening. I got some help and was able to finally open them, but this batch definitely has bad pumps."
8,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Matcha Green Tea Shampoo & Conditioner Dual Pack, 15.2 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Pump Doesn't Work!,I found out this is a common complaint--the pump doesn't work!

0,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Linseed Chia & French Plum Volume Boost Dry Shampoo, 7 Ounce, 2 count, with Naturally Derived Ingredients",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, negative was personal preference","So it was difficult to put 4 stars for this instead of 5, as I really loved using it and I love the NYM brand in general. It did it‚Äôs job well. However, there was one huge downside. I‚Äôll write the positives first. This worked absolutely incredibly as a dry shampoo. Made my hair look incredible and I liked the smell. It worked better than other dry shampoos I used. True to their brand, it is a very dependable product. In a pinch, it‚Äôs a life saver.Downside - and this is more personal preference, but it is a deal breaker for me. It made my hair more difficult to brush through. And where I typically have really soft, fine, feathery hair, that was really frustrating for me. It definitely thickened my hair a lot when I needed to use it. I have a job where I was super active and would sweat a lot which made my hair greasy and dirty looking in a day, so I definitely need a dry shampoo while working. Tried this because I try to stick with natural hair and skin products. Made my hair look great, but the feel of my hair and the coarseness when I brushed were not okay with me, especially where I hate pulling my hair up/back.But, the point is to make greasy/oily hair look clean. It definitely did that."

This one ranks in the bottom. It made my hair so dull and dry and lifeless. So much powdery residue even after shaking the can for a while then spraying, brushing and blowing it out with the dryer. I couldn‚Äôt even get the brush through my hair after using it. Bought this on a whim bc the two pack was a decent price but I‚Äôll definitely go back to my tried and true brand I purchase at target. The only upside to this one is the scent isn‚Äôt terrible. Won‚Äôt buy again."
2,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Linseed Chia & French Plum Volume Boost Dry Shampoo, 7 Ounce, 2 count, with Naturally Derived Ingredients",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Great,"I usually use the Not Your Mother‚Äôs volumizing dry shampoo but decided to try this out for the natural ingredients. I feel like it dried my hair out and weighed it down a lot. It also got matted and tangled easily and the texture was pretty stiff. It does absorb oil, so works as intended in that regard. Otherwise, not my fav and I‚Äôll go back to the original."

I get a good 5 days more of not washing my hair. Time saver. Huge time saver.,"I know that sounds bad, but I try to follow the no poo low poo shampoo method. I have been extending periods of washing my hair, for 20 yrs. It started, as a time thing. First every other day, then once a week, then every 2 weeks and so on. I then read baby powder, but I had none, so I used corn starch. It did make my hair less shiny, but it absorbed the grease. My aunt hardly washes her hair and she has hair like a teenager. I don't know how I stumbled onto this product, but boy am I glad I did. The day before it arrived, my hair was bad. Very bad, due to the hot weather. I decided to wait a day, to try this product, knowing that probably nothing but a good wash could help.  I was wrong. I got another 5 days out of not washing my hair and it looked good. Great even. Purchased another one for my friend, for her birthday. This is a must have. Not 5 stars. 10.."
0,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Royal Honey & Kalahari Melon Dry Shampoo, 14 Ounce, with Naturally Derived Ingredients, for all hair types, 7 Ounce (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Most Amazing Dry Shampoo EVER!,"I have probably tried over 20 different dry shampoos over the years- high end, low end, baby powder, cornstarch- NOTHING worked. I have dark brown hair that tends to run on the oily side, and is also relatively fine. Most dry shampoos just weigh down my hair and make it look even greasier than it was before! I have tried Not Your Mother's ""conventional"" dry shampoos and honestly I hated them; they were the worst offenders in terms of making my hair look worse, PLUS they knotted up my hair. However, this Naturals line is incredible! I used the unscented version of this for a long time but then could no longer find it in stores or online for a reasonable price, which made me upset because it was the best I had ever used. This stuff is even BETTER! The tapioca and rice flour makes a very very fine mist, which doesn't weigh my hair down and still absorbs oil way better than any other dry shampoo I have ever used. And the smell is INCREDIBLE! I do have to use quite a bit of this if my hair is looking greasy, but this dry shampoo is very buildable and doesn't leave a white chalky residue in my hair either. I used to have to wash my hair every day, that's how greasy it was, but now I can go three days or more with this dry shampoo.  I also like that it has 97% naturally derived ingredients; it makes me feel better about putting it on my scalp. I hope they never stop making it because I will buy it forever!"

I‚Äôve only used it once and it‚Äôs the worst dry shampoo I‚Äôve ever used.Just a few sprays around my part and I looked like I dumped a pound of flour on my head. After rubbing it in for a whhhile, I felt a thick residue of buildup - worse than $3 hairspray level buildup. I added an extra star because the smell is *fine* (not my favorite but doesn‚Äôt make me gag)So at the end of the day - my scalp is itchy, my dark brown hair has a white glow at the scalp, and I can‚Äôt even run my fingers through it at the top.This is the first review I‚Äôve ever written but I feel *passionately* disappointed, so hopefully it prevents someone from wasting their money."
2,"Not Your Mother's Naturals Royal Honey & Kalahari Melon Dry Shampoo, 14 Ounce, with Naturally Derived Ingredients, for all hair types, 7 Ounce (Pack of 2)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for greasy hair,"I have really fine oily hair and im typically one of the people that need to wash my hair everyday or I look terrible.. this brand is my favorite for getting my oily hair to look clean and light. I've tried every single one that this brand offers, and they all smell great and they all work the same. They do leave a light color ""frost"" on your hair, but I use my hand and kinda rub it in and do a tease motion and it works great."

I found it actually works a little better with my brown hair than the original NYM's dry shampoo spray.  It still absorbs the oil as well but is easier for me to work in so you can't see the white powder on my brown hair.

I decided to get this one. For the most part it is amazing, the small isn‚Äôt to strong, it does what it is supposed to do, butttttt it flakes a little bit. The other stuff I use by the brand does not do this. I don‚Äôt hate it if I do it the night before. I still recommend getting this for a back up."

0,Not Your Mother's Naturals Clarify & Detox Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Activated Bamboo Charcoal & Purple Moonstone - Remove Hair Impurities & Build-Up,5.0 out of 5 stars,üôÇ,"I have been using thhis shampoo and conditioner for a few years now and it works really well on my hair which I do not plan on switching. I have medium type of thickness hair that is slightly wavy and straight and gets oily fast but this helps keep my hair less oily. I use it once a day. Generally speaking with all shampoos that I have used if I dont wash my hair everyday, my scalp gets itchy. Which may just be my scalps fault not the shampoos. Even though it is charcoal it won't strip your hair; it leaves it nourished. Also the price was what I would have paid for in stores so I am glad I found it for the same price."
1,Not Your Mother's Naturals Clarify & Detox Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Activated Bamboo Charcoal & Purple Moonstone - Remove Hair Impurities & Build-Up,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells good pumps difficult to start,I purchased this kind as well as the tea tree at the same time. All of the bottles are difficult to get the pump started on. Not sure i will buy the tea tree again however this one i probably will.It is a great clarifying shampoo. Works well to clean hair.Make sure when shampooing you only use product mostly on scalp and very little on ends as with other shampoos. This one containing charcoal can cause it to be even more drying on ends as it deeply cleanses. Overall i am happy with the actual product just not with the pumps. It doesn't just pop up but needs to be pulled up while holding the bottle. Sounds picky to complain about but it can be tricky for my kids to use and took some time to even get the pump to start working. The first time i used it i ended up opening the bottle rather than using the pump because it wouldnt start and had to get it started after my shower rather than waste water. I hadn't expected to have it be difficult to start.As a product i do recommend it. Just be sure to get the pumps started before getting in the shower.

My scalp and top of my hair can get oily very quickly because it‚Äôs thin but my hair is long and the ends are dry as is.. and I‚Äôve only found a few products that‚Äôs don‚Äôt make it as oily.. THIS MADE IT SO DRY!!! More hair than normal came out in the shower, my scalp started to burn/tingle, my scalp still doesn‚Äôt feel right like 16 hours later and my hair feels so much worse I‚Äôm so, so upset. 10/10 do not recommend."

28,Not Your Mother's Naturals Clarify & Detox Shampoo and Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Activated Bamboo Charcoal & Purple Moonstone - Remove Hair Impurities & Build-Up,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pros and cons,I like the product but not the packaging. In terms of the product it feels like you are washing your hair with the shampoo and not washing shampoo from your hair so that is the biggest reason I liked this product. I don‚Äôt feel like I have extra product sitting on my hair and I use less with this new one. In terms of moisturizing and softness vs. my old personal choice Tressamae (or however you spell it lol) it feels equal to in regards of moisturizing but in terms of softness I think it‚Äôs less than but that‚Äôs bc I don‚Äôt think there is extra product just sitting around in my hair making it feel like it‚Äôs soft. And the activated charcoal scent in the black bottle has kind of a mineral smell but not a bad one it just isn‚Äôt really scented. But the packaging! Ugh. I received my first set a the conditioner pump would not pump at all and I paid like $20 I would expect the product to be able to be extracted from the bottle properly! So they Amazon sent me a new set and bam! The shampoo bottle nozzle was completely broken off! Ugh it was so frustrating. Like please why can‚Äôt I just get a set that works!

But somebody PLEASE tell me how to pop the top? I spent at least 10 minute struggling with this in the shower before I whacked it it off the tub a couple times out of frustration. Thing finally popped up but what a headache. And what's funny is the product was leaked out from the top not being screwed on tight. Good product but they need to fix the bottle.UPDATE: I have been using this for a while and quickly started to notice that it seemed like i was shedding more hair than usual. So for a week or two I went back to my old shampoo/conditioner and my hair seemed fine. Went back to not your mothers again....and hair was covering my shower floor. I wanted to like this for its smell and squeaky clean but I think what ever chemicals are in this is too harsh for my hair.
1,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great,Nothing irritates me more than when you buy an item with a pump and the pump doesn't work.  The shampoo and conditioner are very thick and hard to distribute through your hair. It smelled good but the smell doesn't last very long. Also after washing my hair it felt very dry and damaged.  I only used for a little over a week. I will probably just use this stuff to shave my legs or something. I would definitely NOT recommend this product. Not worth the money.
2,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Lightweight Shampoo/Conditioner,"I‚Äôm really happy with this shampoo. I was looking for something that cleansed well and moisturized without weighing my fine hair down, and this does it for me. My only complaint is that it took me days to get the conditioner pump to work correctly."
3,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the product.  Hate the pump.,Great shampoo and conditioner.  Smells good.  Detangles my knotty hair.  Love it. But I hate the pumps. One pump broke so we have to take off the top and the teens never put it back on so it dumps and gets water in it. The other pump takes a few seconds to pop back up.  A bit irritating.  Could be because both shampoo and conditioner are really thick- which I love.  I have already bought again.  Hoping pump is an oops.  I love all the products I have bought from ‚Äúnot your mothers‚Äù so I‚Äôll just hope my next pumps work better.
4,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),5.0 out of 5 stars,Bounce and Non-Oily,"I love the way my hair feels after I wash it. There is some bounce and I can go a couple of days between washings because it doesn't get oily. The scent threw me off a little the first time or two, but now I don't really notice it. It reminds me of a powder I used to smell on older ladies who wore Avon perfume when I was a kid. Overall, 5 stars."
5,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),2.0 out of 5 stars,Sent different set,"Wish I could review this scent/combo, but we were sent the Blood Orange & Black Currant set. We were literally out of shampoo & conditioner, so we kept it. The pumps were both broken (we just used our empty bottle ones), and I feel like the shampoo is too thick & doesn‚Äôt pump properly. Long story short, I won‚Äôt ‚Äúbuy‚Äù the blood Orange set again and hope if I order this, this one is actually sent this time. (We love the Apple Blossom & Green Tea‚Ä¶maybe we should just stick with that). ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
6,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,Expired and very dehydrating,"Returned after a few uses, because my hair went from soft to dry as straw. I started wondering if maybe it was expired, and so I took a look at the bottle. The company who sold it took white out and covered everything up. I scratched it off and did some research and realized that it was, in fact, expired. Nice try trying to fool customers, though."
7,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe not for dry prone hair,"The product is good and smells great. I tried it because it is recommended for curly girl hair. However, my scalp and hair tend to be dry, and this product seemed to dry it out more."
8,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair Loss,"So, I‚Äôm a big fan of NYM products and this is the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced hair loss from their products. My curls aren‚Äôt happening anymore and my break is either breaking or just falling out."
9,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this for my hair,5 star for no harmful ingredients to my hair. I have thin hair but the conditioner leaves hairy so shiney and light. Will but again and again.
10,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchase this,Cheaper then target and love the way it smells. Makes my hair feel very soft
11,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,Smell good,"These clean my hair and smell great, but the scent is STRONG. If you are scent sensitive these are not for you because it lasts for days. I have oily hair and I find myself needing to wash sooner using this set than other brands, but it feels clean and moisturized each time I wash. This particular duo may be better for normal to dry hair. I would buy this brand again in another combination to try next time for myself."
12,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,Inconveniently Difficult Shampoo Container,"The shampoo is really thick so it doesn‚Äôt really even come out like at all, for my thick hair. I use a decent amount of this shampoo to actually be able to lather it, but this container doesn‚Äôt work wonders for the shampoo.What‚Äôs inside the bottle is a dream!!! Moisturizer, and after a months use my hair has grown more than it did on Function of Beauty!! That and the scent is very strong but I love the orange!!! üíñ"
13,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,I received the wrong shampoo and it was nothing special,I got the wrong kind. I ordered the aquatic mint or whatever and I got the Sicilian orange one‚Ä¶ I figured I‚Äôd give it a go since I ordered it to our new house while moving & on the road. I didn‚Äôt have the energy after driving cross country to do yet another Amazon return. Sooo I suppose I‚Äôm reviewing the orange one‚Ä¶ I do not suggest it‚Ä¶. Doesn‚Äôt smell great and has done nothing for my hair. Invest in a more quality  duo‚Ä¶
14,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,Pumps don‚Äôt work!!!,"Both pumps wouldn‚Äôt open. Super annoying! They are in my shower with the whole lid off, just so I can get to the dang product. Which isn‚Äôt even that good. I find it drying, the smell is just ok. It is not worth the hassle of sending them back. I‚Äôll never buy their products again though."
15,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice Scent, Good Moisture","According to my wife: Nice smell and with long hair, can easily brush out with no tangle after a shower. Does it‚Äôs job with moisture. The shampoo has a super nice lather. The pumps SUCKED. Had to dig through the recycling to get the caps of the previous shampoo and conditioner and replace."
16,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,Clean and soft hair,"This has a great scent, cleans, and doesn't strip your hair of moisture. I have fine, thin, wavy hair and it worked great for me."
17,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,Pumps are Broken,"I called the manufacturer who said they‚Äôd send different pumps that are being replaced on future bottles, but after a month, they have not arrived.I love these products, but until they replace the broken pumps, you‚Äôll need an alternative way to get the shampoo & conditioner out."
18,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice products!,"I used this shampoo and conditioner for the first time last night and the smell was great! Made my hair feel really clean and healthy, when I wake up my hair usually looks greasy since I have such fine hair, but this morning it looked great üòä the only thing I don‚Äôt like is the pumps, they are a pain in the butt to pump for some reason."
19,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),2.0 out of 5 stars,Love these products!,"The shampoo has a broken pump and when I write to return it or ask for a new pump, they want me to travel nearly an hour to return it!! I will just deal with it..."
20,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the shampoo, hate the pump","I absolutely love these products, however, this the second set where the pump on the shampoo doesn't work as well as the conditioner pump. I think the product is too thick for the pump. Maybe they need a more robust one?"
21,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),2.0 out of 5 stars,Pumps dont work and the scent is aweful,I bought this because of the price and the saying is you get what you pay for.  The pumps dont work and the scent is aweful unless you want to smell like a wet dog all day.  I didnt find this to be very moisterizing as well.  I am going to take a loss and throw this out and order something different.
22,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,No,"My hair never really felt clean but I figured maybe that was just bc I‚Äôm used to using cheaper products. But then my scalp started breaking out, which has never happened in my life. I stopped using the shampoo but even with just the conditioner, my shoulders are constantly broken out. Never happened before in my whole life until using this product. Also the pumps suck, but I feel like that‚Äôs been covered."
23,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),3.0 out of 5 stars,Received different product than ordered; like items received. Bad pump.,"I like the shampoo and conditioner I received (Sicilian blood orange) rather than the mint that I bought. Furthermore, although the product is nice, the pumo on the shamppi is terrible. I can only pumo once before it gets stuck or something. Could just be a bad bottle; I'd try again."
24,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great smell, horrible pumps","The shampoo and conditioner smell great, but these pumps on them are trash. I got 9ne use before they stopped working which is super inconvenient. I'd rather they just trade it for a squirter top."

28,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),5.0 out of 5 stars,"Shipping problem, great product","The product is wonderful. The shipping was terrible. For one thing, this is mislabeled in the warehouse, resulting in receiving the wrong set multiple times. Second the pump was damaged and doesn‚Äôt actually pump."
29,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells wonderful!,"Smells wonderful!!! Only issue I have is that the pump is very difficult as far as typical pumps go. I've gotten other scents from this brand and they were fine, so it may just be a little defect in certain bottles. Shampoo is thicker than most so that could be the reason why as well."
30,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),3.0 out of 5 stars,Shampoo & Conditioner,I loved this at first and it smells great but I noticed a lot more fall out while using this.

34,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful smell,I should‚Äôve paid attention to the other review about the smell.

100,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,Scent is too strong for sensitive noses,"This review is only for the shampoo in Aquatic Mint. Initially the scent is nice but it was overbearing for my sensitive nose. I have long thick hair so I tried to rinse it out as much as possible but it was so strong on the first day that it gave me a headache. I assumed it would eventually dissipate. Three days later and I'm still waking up with headaches from the strong smell in my hair. I finally washed it out with vinegar and a different shampoo, but won't be able to use this again."
101,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful packaging and product,"Shampoo and conditioner are mediocre, but even worse are the pumps on the bottles. They are terrible. Will not purchase from this brand again. Not impressed."
102,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice!,The products are wonderful but it was difficult to initially unlock the pump tops so we could use the products. We bought two sets and they were both problematic to open.
103,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice smell, that's about it","The smell is nice, the shampoo lathers well and cleans the hair. That's about it. The conditioner is a joke. It does nothing, and is really only good for using as a shaving cream. Would not recommend and will not repurchase."
104,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,Scent is relaxing,I received this instead of the Blood Orange shampoo and conditioner but im excited to try these.

106,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),2.0 out of 5 stars,Nah,It has nothing to do with making your hair softer. Hair gets so stuck that your hands can't go thru to wash properly. Also gives dehydrating feeling.
107,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),4.0 out of 5 stars,The caps broke immediately but the product is excellent,Using Not Your Mother's product for about 4 months has given me so much new hair and it's so much fuller and has so much more body. The shampoo does not larger as much as regular shampoo so you have to use a little more. Just shampoo your scalp. The conditioner is great but I don't use it on scalp. I'll never use another product
108,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money.,"The pump on the bottles are stupid. They smell good but the scent doesn't stay in your hair after you rinse it out. And if you have even the slightest dandruff, you'll regret using this. I've used the NYM Blonde Moment shampoo and loved it, so I thought I'd try more of their products and I wish I hadn't.Serious waste of money."

116,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommended for Colored Hair,I had recently had my hair highlighted and my stylist suggested this brand because a lot of the commercial brands will actually strip the color right out and I didn‚Äôt want to waste all that time and money I had spent. I usually go to Ulta but I didn‚Äôt have time to slip there so I just ordered on Prime since the prices were comparable. Excellent shampoo and conditioner. It has held the color in my hair and also keep its soft and shiny.

Yet it was comparable in price so I tried it. Neither pumps to the bottles work, and yes I know how the pumps on different shampoo bottles can be different or difficult.

125,Not Your Mother's Naturals Aquatic Mint Blue Sea Holly Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each),1.0 out of 5 stars,Wrong description,I didn't like it at all.
0,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult to open,The smell is to die for and my hair feels amazing. But somebody PLEASE tell me how to pop the top? I spent at least 10 minute struggling with this in the shower before I whacked it it off the tub a couple times out of frustration. Thing finally popped up but what a headache. And what's funny is the product was leaked out from the top not being screwed on tight. Good product but they need to fix the bottle.UPDATE: I have been using this for a while and quickly started to notice that it seemed like i was shedding more hair than usual. So for a week or two I went back to my old shampoo/conditioner and my hair seemed fine. Went back to not your mothers again....and hair was covering my shower floor. I wanted to like this for its smell and squeaky clean but I think what ever chemicals are in this is too harsh for my hair.
1,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great,Nothing irritates me more than when you buy an item with a pump and the pump doesn't work.  The shampoo and conditioner are very thick and hard to distribute through your hair. It smelled good but the smell doesn't last very long. Also after washing my hair it felt very dry and damaged.  I only used for a little over a week. I will probably just use this stuff to shave my legs or something. I would definitely NOT recommend this product. Not worth the money.
2,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Lightweight Shampoo/Conditioner,"I‚Äôm really happy with this shampoo. I was looking for something that cleansed well and moisturized without weighing my fine hair down, and this does it for me. My only complaint is that it took me days to get the conditioner pump to work correctly."
3,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,I like the product.  Hate the pump.,Great shampoo and conditioner.  Smells good.  Detangles my knotty hair.  Love it. But I hate the pumps. One pump broke so we have to take off the top and the teens never put it back on so it dumps and gets water in it. The other pump takes a few seconds to pop back up.  A bit irritating.  Could be because both shampoo and conditioner are really thick- which I love.  I have already bought again.  Hoping pump is an oops.  I love all the products I have bought from ‚Äúnot your mothers‚Äù so I‚Äôll just hope my next pumps work better.
4,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Bounce and Non-Oily,"I love the way my hair feels after I wash it. There is some bounce and I can go a couple of days between washings because it doesn't get oily. The scent threw me off a little the first time or two, but now I don't really notice it. It reminds me of a powder I used to smell on older ladies who wore Avon perfume when I was a kid. Overall, 5 stars."
5,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Sent different set,"Wish I could review this scent/combo, but we were sent the Blood Orange & Black Currant set. We were literally out of shampoo & conditioner, so we kept it. The pumps were both broken (we just used our empty bottle ones), and I feel like the shampoo is too thick & doesn‚Äôt pump properly. Long story short, I won‚Äôt ‚Äúbuy‚Äù the blood Orange set again and hope if I order this, this one is actually sent this time. (We love the Apple Blossom & Green Tea‚Ä¶maybe we should just stick with that). ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
6,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Expired and very dehydrating,"Returned after a few uses, because my hair went from soft to dry as straw. I started wondering if maybe it was expired, and so I took a look at the bottle. The company who sold it took white out and covered everything up. I scratched it off and did some research and realized that it was, in fact, expired. Nice try trying to fool customers, though."
7,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe not for dry prone hair,"The product is good and smells great.

If you are scent sensitive these are not for you because it lasts for days. I have oily hair and I find myself needing to wash sooner using this set than other brands, but it feels clean and moisturized each time I wash. This particular duo may be better for normal to dry hair. I would buy this brand again in another combination to try next time for myself."
12,"Not Your Mother's Not Your Mother's Naturals Sicilian Blood Orange Smooth and Soften Shampoo + Conditioner Set - 16 Oz (1 Of Each), 32 ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Inconveniently Difficult Shampoo Container,"The shampoo is really thick so it doesn‚Äôt really even come out like at all, for my thick hair. I use a decent amount of this shampoo to actually be able to lather it, but this container doesn‚Äôt work wonders for the shampoo.What‚Äôs inside the bottle is a dream!!! Moisturizer, and after a months use my hair has grown more than it did on Function of Beauty!! That and the scent is very strong but I love the orange!!! üíñ"

I ordered the aquatic mint or whatever and I got the Sicilian orange one‚Ä¶ I figured I‚Äôd give it a go since I ordered it to our new house while moving & on the road. I didn‚Äôt have the energy after driving cross country to do yet another Amazon return. Sooo I suppose I‚Äôm reviewing the orange one‚Ä¶ I do not suggest it‚Ä¶. Doesn‚Äôt smell great and has done nothing for my hair. Invest in a more quality  duo‚Ä¶

Super annoying! They are in my shower with the whole lid off, just so I can get to the dang product. Which isn‚Äôt even that good. I find it drying, the smell is just ok.

But then my scalp started breaking out, which has never happened in my life. I stopped using the shampoo but even with just the conditioner, my shoulders are constantly broken out.

Initially the scent is nice but it was overbearing for my sensitive nose. I have long thick hair so I tried to rinse it out as much as possible but it was so strong on the first day that it gave me a headache. I assumed it would eventually dissipate. Three days later and I'm still waking up with headaches from the strong smell in my hair. I finally washed it out with vinegar and a different shampoo, but won't be able to use this again."

My ‚Äúslightly curly‚Äù hair went very very curly after just one use of the shampoo, conditioner and curling cream.  What a difference good products can make.

I don‚Äôt think this will give you curly hair if yours is straight but if you have a slight curl and want to see what happens, give it a shot!  I will definitely be purchasing this again!"
2,"Not Your Mothers Naturals Curl Defining Hair Care Set, Tahitian Gardenia Flower and Mango Butter, Shampoo, Conditioner and Curl Defining Cream",3.0 out of 5 stars,Worst scent in the history of scents.,"I should have listened to some of the other reviews. For starters my hair actually loves these and given how temperamental my curly hair is, that's huge.. But.. The scent of this stuff.. Just why?? It is the most unpleasant thing I've ever smelled in a hair product. I tried to power through it because my hair was loving it, but every now and then I'd get a whiff of it and nearly gag... It's like cherry cough syrup mixed with black liquorice.. Who in the product design thought this scent would be remotely OK?? How did this product make it all the way through development without someone in the company going ""hey guys this is horrible"".It's really a shame because I can not stress enough how wonderful the product is otherwise. Unfortunately it's just not worth it for me, the smell is just that bad."
3,"Not Your Mothers Naturals Curl Defining Hair Care Set, Tahitian Gardenia Flower and Mango Butter, Shampoo, Conditioner and Curl Defining Cream",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff but cheaper by far elsewhere,"I found these items afterwards in Shoprite MUCH cheaper. But, I have type 2C curls and hands down these products are the BEST system I have EVER used (and I have tried everything during my quest). One of the best things is you don't need to load the combing cream on. My hair is shoulder length (dry) and I use total about the size of a dime (half when just towel dried and the other half to finish when 80% dry). Gorgeous! No frizz all day!"

5,"Not Your Mothers Naturals Curl Defining Hair Care Set, Tahitian Gardenia Flower and Mango Butter, Shampoo, Conditioner and Curl Defining Cream",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for long hair!,"These products have much going for them. They smell delicious (more fruity than perfumey)  and keep my curls smooth and bouncy. However, if you have long hair, beware. The bottles have very small pumps. Along with the fact that the consistency of the product is similar to honey, wtf? Push down, get less than a thimble full, wait 10 seconds for the pump to rise and repeat 12 times. You could remove the pump and pour but it's messy and why should we have to? Did no one product test this? It's good but not good enough to be delayed and frustrated every time I wash my hair."

However, this product did not define or smooth my 4B/4C hair texture.  My wash and go and twist out with this product were dry and frizzy. Perhaps a different hair texture would have better results.  Also the product has a unique, strong scent which dissipates quickly after drying."

Recently realized I have curly hair, and this is a good product for a first timer, trying to learn curly girl method.Bc of the way the bottles seal, they will likely arrive sticky with a little leakage from the pump tops. Just rinse, the bottles aren't damaged, just poorly designed for shipping.Otherwise great product line!"

10,"Not Your Mothers Naturals Curl Defining Hair Care Set, Tahitian Gardenia Flower and Mango Butter, Shampoo, Conditioner and Curl Defining Cream",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wash day favs,I have finally found my wash day favs. I have been transtioning for 3 years now and I havent been able to find wash day products that my hair likes.

I liked the smell in the bottle. I liked the smell when I used the product on my little sister. I then used the product on myself, and I hated the smell. Somehow this smell did not mesh with my body chemistry at all. It was bad enough I had to reshower with something else. I‚Äôve been using the blue one (coconut water and sea kelp) for months with no issue, but thought I would give this a go since I have curly hair."

I‚Äôm disappointed.,"I love this product! I just used it! My hair is usually so weighed down by products but not with this! The only think I will say is that I did not receive the cream. I‚Äôm really disappointed. I wanted to try it too, which I why I ordered it. The problem is that I can‚Äôt return it because I‚Äôve already used it. I just want the cream too! So I‚Äôm changing my rating to be lower because they won‚Äôt just replace the cream. I‚Äôd have to return the product for a full refund. That‚Äôs frustrating."

It works well on my hair and my daughters. It has a pleasant scent. I am unhappy with how it arrived. One of the pumps was broken and  taped on. So I needed to switch them around.

I think the price is fine, as far as naturals go. The pumps did not work well, so I have open bottles sitting in the shower, which bothers me a lot. I have purchased these from whole foods, and those pumps were fine, so I‚Äôm hoping it was just a fluke. Same price in store, also. The fragrance is quite strong for me, but I am super sensitive to fragrances, and I‚Äôve definitely smelled stronger! I actually like the pink set for curly hair best. The fragrance is better and it leaves my hair shinier and more nourished. That one I got for my daughter, then I ended up using all of it!"

0,"Not Your Mother's Naturals High Moisture Smoothing Cream (2-Pack) - 8 fl oz - Coconut Milk & African Marula Tree Oil - Lasting Frizz Control, Natural Flexible Hold",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful moisturizer for non porous hair.,"I have thin, curly hair that does not like a lot of protein. It loves coconut milk, but not coconut oil. This leave in was wonderful. It's still easy to overdo it if I use too much, so I am careful with the amount. Leaves hair soft and helps with frizz, although for a decent hold, use a gel on top."

1,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First time use - good results, bad price","***Edit***I'm editing my original review because of something I just learned. Being new to CGM and the different products, I didn't realize that the price on this product was higher than it should have been. While visiting my local Walgreens, I found the exact same brand and sized bottles, 16 Oz, for $8 a piece. This seller is gouging customers by charging $30+ for the set! Absolutely unacceptable and while I will definitelycontinueusing the product, I will never purchase from this seller .***Smells really great without being too strong. After my first use, I was very happy with the curl outcome and will continue using. My only complaint is regarding the packaging. The pump is way too short and doesn't give enough product at one time. The product itself is great."
2,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Description says 16 bottles, but only got 2","This description said you would get 8 shampoos and 8 conditioners. So I paid the huge price for it. When it came, there was only one shampoo and one conditioner, and both pumps on the bottles were broken off. The description clearly says 16 bottles, and I would never have paid so much money for two bottles. Infuriating"
3,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and great value!!,"I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is so soft and moisturized after using it. I also love the scent!!! 10/10 recommend - great product foe the price.After following the curly girl method for about a year, I‚Äôve come to a routine where I wash with the shampoo, rinse, rake conditioner through my hair, brush conditioner, and squish to condition (leaving most of the conditioner in my hair). I love the results! I won‚Äôt go back to any other shampoo I‚Äôve tried before.I hope this helps!!"
4,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product but the pumps could be A LOT better,"I have wavy hair and I have been embracing the texture recently and using products that amp up the curl factor. I really love this shampoo/conditioner set. It smells amazing and it brings out my curls. My only issue is that the conditioner pump was broken when it arrived. I have to just take the lid off and squeeze it out during my showers. It wasn't worth it to me to try and send it back but it is an annoyance. The pumps themselves feel pretty cheap so I am not surprised that one failed before it even arrived. That being said, I do really like the product itself and I will probably continue to buy it, hopefully the next set works properly."
5,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly girl method approved,Have been trying to do the curly girl method and these to products are approved and make my hair look great. I can get beautiful clumps of curls without having yucky buildup on my hair.
6,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,...,Item description clearly states 16 COUNT.  Only recieved 2. Never would have paid 34 dollars for this product.  It is a very good product but not good enough to be mislead by seller in description.
7,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not ""natural ingredients"" and shampoo strips all the moisture","I'd skip the shampoo and find a more moisturizing one if you've got curlies. I'm unsure what I expected, it says natural but it's ""natural"" meaning, nah, bb this is all chemicals with a nice scent.It smells nice but I'm pretty sure I just spent $40 on drug store product. The shampoo completely strips my hair to the point it feels like straw and the conditioner works well...but would it work better if the poo didn't strip? Probably. Is it thick? I guess? Feels about the same as anything.I'm disappointed and I'll probably move this along to someone else."
8,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing no protein,"So this shampoo and conditioner is great for people who are protein sensitive and need a lot of moisture. That is not me. I need a decent amount of protein in my routine and 2 months after purchasing my hair was over moisturized and lost a lot of volume. This is definitely a case of my hair not responding well to a good product and not that the product is bad. I would recommend this to anyone who is in protein overload or is protein sensitive, this is just not for me"
9,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great curl defining shampoo and conditioner!,"I have wavy, frizzy hair. When I started using this shampoo and conditioner I was a skeptic. Each time I wash my hair with Not Your Mother‚Äôs Naturals Curl Defining products I get luscious curls without frizz. It‚Äôs magical! I‚Äôve never liked my hair down and natural but now I love it! My curls are so pretty and I no longer feel as though I have to wear my hair up in a ponytail to mask the kinkiness and waves."
10,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,So worth it!,Besides going to the salon to get your hair done I swear to you it's the best shampoo and conditioner I ever bought üòå I'm so unbelievably happy with how my hair feels after a wash.. Also this is a great foaming shampoo unlike most where it feels like it just sits there. This feels like it goes right to my scalp making it feel oh so good... I could really go on and on but Give it a try you won't be disappointed I promise you.. i got the set for Curl Defining
11,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,Conditioner is weak,"The shampoo is really nice, lightly floral and fruity scented, slightly moisturizing.The conditioner is a flop, the consistency is a lot thinner than most conditioners. It feels like water and is barely even useful to detangle my hair in the shower. I tried letting it sit in my hair for a few minutes while washing up and it kinda just washes off really fast without feeling like it did anything. Found myself struggling to detangle my curls in the shower which is bad for a product meant for curly hair.Would recommend if you have thin of fine hair  since it's light weight and non greasy. Unfortunately if you have curly hair I'd recommend just getting the shampoo and finding a different conditioner."
12,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Did nothing for my curls,"In fact, this made my hair much worse. I have more split ends than I‚Äôve ever had. It just doesn‚Äôt moisturize in a good way. In the shower it feels nice, sure. Feels like my hair will get moisture. The conditioner is really heavy, but once rinsed out it gave my hair a sort of heavy and dry feeling. I have very wavy asian mixed hair. The smell is nice, but would not buy again. The amount of buildup this combo gave me was insane. I usually wash my hair every 3 days, but needed a daily wash with this."
13,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading description! Not as advertised!,"This ad is fraudulent and misleading. It clearly states a 16 count which means 8 shampoos and 8 conditioners. I received two items. $35 for two bottles of over-the-counter shampoo and conditioner which retail for about $5 or $6 a piece, is price scouging. I love this product, but I will not pay astronomical prices for it. The seller is completely unethical, completely misleading and this should be taken down or updated immediately."
14,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only stuff that works on our hair,"I have had annoying to handle curls/waves all my life and being married and having to cover my hair... I'm grateful lol bc i hated dealing with it. We have two toddlers with very beautiful,curly hair. Their hair gets knotty and this brand has a detangler which is the only effective detangler we've found, so i tried this and i don't even need the detangler most times. This makes their curls so bouncy and defined. Love this brand"
15,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,conditioner has AMAZING slip !!,I don't usually ever write reviews but this product is AMAZING !! I have 3b/3c hair and have never  detangled my hair so fast and easily as with this conditioner. I haven't tried the shampoo yet but I am super excited for my next wash !! Definitely recommend this brand and product for ALL hair types !! also cgm approved :))
16,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of a let down,"So many people following the curly girl method have recommended this shampoo and conditioner that I had to try it. I just wasn't impressed. It left my waves flat and lifeless. Also, I expected this stuff to smell amazing. The scent of the shampoo was very faint floral and the conditioner lacked a scent but somehow managed to smell bad. It's almost as though they forgot to put the scent in the mixture before bottling it. What a let down. I only used it a few times before throwing the bottles away."
17,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Super greasy hair,The product has a great smell and the shampoo works pretty well...it's the conditioner that's the issue.  There is no happy medium...if you don't rinse enough then you have this greasy weird residue in your hair that looks like you didn't wash it. If you rinse too much then it is like you have no conditioner at all. It does not work for my hair at all. I can't stand the feeling of being able to still feel the conditioner in my hair like gel.
18,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I have a lot of skin allergies and so there really isn't that many shampoos i can use. I had used another shampoo in this brand but the price had tripled so I found this set. It smells so good. I don't have curly hair at all - it's very straight but idc. Imma gonna use it anyways. Ha
19,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great everyday wash,Working in a hospital and having curly hair is a difficult balancing act when it comes to frizzy dry hair. I love the smell and fact that I can fully wash my hair everyday without it drying out or getting all frizzy. Nice light scent too. Also if you follow a low poo/cg method these are perfect.
20,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for thin curly hair,Just started my curl journey to better my curls and create healthier hair..well this product got me off to a great start! It is lightweight and allows for my thin hair to have more curl without all the heavy product weighing it down which was causing my curls to be non-existent. I bought this product one year ago and I am just now needing a new bottle. A whole year for one shampoo/conditioner bottle... definitely a great value for my money. Yes I am washing my hair about every 3-4 days. The smell is faint and not too strong for those wondering and I have a super smeller nose so it doesn't bother me at all. Great product! Super approved!

Smells great takes a little more to get it lathered but works good. The conditioner on the other hand smells terrible and it's always right after I start rinsing.

47,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"Expensive price for two small bottles. The scent is overly sweet (almost like bubble gum or candy). I purchased on scent alone, and the fact that this brand is cruelty-free.

Cheap packaging and to prevent the fluids from leaking they put packaging tape around the bottles.

101,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Great
102,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for fine-textured hair; good alternative to silicone,"As you'd expect from NYM, it's a well-formulated product. Pleasant to use, smells nice, etc. The conditioner leaves a good occlusive film on the hair and is great at controlling winter static and frizz. I would say it's a medium-heavy conditioner because it takes a LOT of rinsing if you don't want a heavy film, and I've taken to thinning it with water before applying it to my ends because it is just Too Much for my fine-textured hair. Even so, it weighs my strands down pretty badly and makes my curls look really terrible, so I don't use it on days when I wear my curls naturally. I would only recommend it for people with stiffer hair strands and probably a tighter curl pattern.If you like the way silicone conditioners affect your hair, this is a good alternative. The quaternium ingredient provides a very similar slippery feel to the hair and would help make tangles etc more manageable. The advantage is there is no build-up, the effects wash out even with sulfate-free shampoo. However, if you do not like the way silicone conditioners feel in your hair (as I don't) this is not the product for you. It makes my hair feel like plasticy barbie doll hair in exactly the same way dimethicone does. Yuck!"
103,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,CHUNKS of hair falling out!,DO NOT BUY THIS! I lost over 50% of my hair from this product! I am devastated! I had beautiful thick hair and within a month of using the shampoo and conditioner all my hair began falling out IN CHUNKS!!!! I barely have any hair left. You can see through my hair and I have thinning and balding throughout all of my hair. This product was the only think that changed in the month of us. My hair is thin and at this point I may have to shave my hair off. I am not being dramatic. I have cried everyday since discovering this was the issue. I stopped using this product and within a week the hair loss stopped!
104,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pump WTH? Shampoo the bomb,"I love this shampoo. The price doesn't bother me if it does what I want and I like the smell. I read reviews about the pump and thought, ""ok, dumb. Review the product not the pump"", but OH MY GAAWD the pump is the worst. How is anyone suppose to get shampoo out of it? I had to take an old squeeze lid and replace pump. Just a tip for the next person. Shampoo 5 star, pump -1, bringing my review down to a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
105,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,I thought my hair was fried,"I bought this shampoo so I could stop using drug store brands. I loved it! It made my hair soft and smelled so nice. But when my hair dried, it had a weird texture and felt like hay. I thought maybe my hair started to get fried from hot tools or maybe dying my hair too much. I changed my routine and couldn‚Äôt figure out why my hair texture changed over night. I couldn‚Äôt style it, it would be clumped in knots seconds after brushing through, it was heartbreaking. I decided to use a different shampoo one day, and walla! My hair was back to normal. I threw this shampoo out immediately after."
106,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work well for 3c hair,This left my curls pretty flat. Did not moisturize very well. I have ringlet curls and I do not need heavy moisturizing but this was so light that my hair would be frizzy just hours after dry. I also do not like the scent. It barely smells like anything at all and doesn't last either. I would not buy this again.
107,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, horrible pumps.

108,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,No Bueno.,The pumps suck.

110,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Grimy & curl enhancing ish,I've always had soft and silky hair. After a severely short hair cut 2 years ago it has started creating these spiral curls. I have been trying curl embracing products to try to help encourage the curl with my silly hair.I've only used this product 3-4 times but my hair feels dirty and grimy all of the time now. It's impossible to brush after when dry and constantly tangles now. These were never problems that I had before.I'm not sure what to do with this product but I don't think I will be counting use anymore.

130,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Conditioner (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Rancid shampoo and plastic conditioner,"I wish I was allowed to return this item, but apparently when I ordered it as a subscription you can't return things. I opened it up and the shampoo smells rancid. Definitely not anything floral or tropical that I was expecting. The conditioner (which should smell the same) smells like plastic or latex. Again, not floral, tropical, or even good. I'm hoping it's a bad batch I was given that was expired, since I've used other NYM products and not had this problem. Guess I'll go to the drugstore and buy it in person where I can smell if it's gone bad. I certainly won't buy from this supplier again."

1,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,"First time use - good results, bad price","***Edit***I'm editing my original review because of something I just learned. Being new to CGM and the different products, I didn't realize that the price on this product was higher than it should have been. While visiting my local Walgreens, I found the exact same brand and sized bottles, 16 Oz, for $8 a piece. This seller is gouging customers by charging $30+ for the set! Absolutely unacceptable and while I will definitelycontinueusing the product, I will never purchase from this seller .***Smells really great without being too strong. After my first use, I was very happy with the curl outcome and will continue using. My only complaint is regarding the packaging. The pump is way too short and doesn't give enough product at one time. The product itself is great."

So I paid the huge price for it. When it came, there was only one shampoo and one conditioner, and both pumps on the bottles were broken off. The description clearly says 16 bottles, and I would never have paid so much money for two bottles. Infuriating"

I also love the scent!!! 10/10 recommend - great product foe the price.After following the curly girl method for about a year, I‚Äôve come to a routine where I wash with the shampoo, rinse, rake conditioner through my hair, brush conditioner, and squish to condition (leaving most of the conditioner in my hair). I love the results! I won‚Äôt go back to any other shampoo I‚Äôve tried before.I hope this helps!!"
4,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product but the pumps could be A LOT better,"I have wavy hair and I have been embracing the texture recently and using products that amp up the curl factor. I really love this shampoo/conditioner set. It smells amazing and it brings out my curls. My only issue is that the conditioner pump was broken when it arrived. I have to just take the lid off and squeeze it out during my showers. It wasn't worth it to me to try and send it back but it is an annoyance. The pumps themselves feel pretty cheap so I am not surprised that one failed before it even arrived. That being said, I do really like the product itself and I will probably continue to buy it, hopefully the next set works properly."
5,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly girl method approved,Have been trying to do the curly girl method and these to products are approved and make my hair look great. I can get beautiful clumps of curls without having yucky buildup on my hair.
6,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,...,Item description clearly states 16 COUNT.  Only recieved 2. Never would have paid 34 dollars for this product.  It is a very good product but not good enough to be mislead by seller in description.
7,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not ""natural ingredients"" and shampoo strips all the moisture","I'd skip the shampoo and find a more moisturizing one if you've got curlies. I'm unsure what I expected, it says natural but it's ""natural"" meaning, nah, bb this is all chemicals with a nice scent.It smells nice but I'm pretty sure I just spent $40 on drug store product. The shampoo completely strips my hair to the point it feels like straw and the conditioner works well...but would it work better if the poo didn't strip? Probably. Is it thick? I guess? Feels about the same as anything.I'm disappointed and I'll probably move this along to someone else."
8,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing no protein,"So this shampoo and conditioner is great for people who are protein sensitive and need a lot of moisture. That is not me. I need a decent amount of protein in my routine and 2 months after purchasing my hair was over moisturized and lost a lot of volume. This is definitely a case of my hair not responding well to a good product and not that the product is bad. I would recommend this to anyone who is in protein overload or is protein sensitive, this is just not for me"
9,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great curl defining shampoo and conditioner!,"I have wavy, frizzy hair. When I started using this shampoo and conditioner I was a skeptic. Each time I wash my hair with Not Your Mother‚Äôs Naturals Curl Defining products I get luscious curls without frizz. It‚Äôs magical! I‚Äôve never liked my hair down and natural but now I love it! My curls are so pretty and I no longer feel as though I have to wear my hair up in a ponytail to mask the kinkiness and waves."
10,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,So worth it!,Besides going to the salon to get your hair done I swear to you it's the best shampoo and conditioner I ever bought üòå I'm so unbelievably happy with how my hair feels after a wash.. Also this is a great foaming shampoo unlike most where it feels like it just sits there. This feels like it goes right to my scalp making it feel oh so good... I could really go on and on but Give it a try you won't be disappointed I promise you.. i got the set for Curl Defining
11,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,Conditioner is weak,"The shampoo is really nice, lightly floral and fruity scented, slightly moisturizing.The conditioner is a flop, the consistency is a lot thinner than most conditioners. It feels like water and is barely even useful to detangle my hair in the shower. I tried letting it sit in my hair for a few minutes while washing up and it kinda just washes off really fast without feeling like it did anything. Found myself struggling to detangle my curls in the shower which is bad for a product meant for curly hair.Would recommend if you have thin of fine hair  since it's light weight and non greasy. Unfortunately if you have curly hair I'd recommend just getting the shampoo and finding a different conditioner."
12,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Did nothing for my curls,"In fact, this made my hair much worse. I have more split ends than I‚Äôve ever had. It just doesn‚Äôt moisturize in a good way. In the shower it feels nice, sure. Feels like my hair will get moisture. The conditioner is really heavy, but once rinsed out it gave my hair a sort of heavy and dry feeling. I have very wavy asian mixed hair. The smell is nice, but would not buy again. The amount of buildup this combo gave me was insane. I usually wash my hair every 3 days, but needed a daily wash with this."
13,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading description! Not as advertised!,"This ad is fraudulent and misleading. It clearly states a 16 count which means 8 shampoos and 8 conditioners. I received two items. $35 for two bottles of over-the-counter shampoo and conditioner which retail for about $5 or $6 a piece, is price scouging. I love this product, but I will not pay astronomical prices for it. The seller is completely unethical, completely misleading and this should be taken down or updated immediately."
14,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only stuff that works on our hair,"I have had annoying to handle curls/waves all my life and being married and having to cover my hair... I'm grateful lol bc i hated dealing with it. We have two toddlers with very beautiful,curly hair. Their hair gets knotty and this brand has a detangler which is the only effective detangler we've found, so i tried this and i don't even need the detangler most times. This makes their curls so bouncy and defined. Love this brand"
15,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,conditioner has AMAZING slip !!,I don't usually ever write reviews but this product is AMAZING !! I have 3b/3c hair and have never  detangled my hair so fast and easily as with this conditioner. I haven't tried the shampoo yet but I am super excited for my next wash !! Definitely recommend this brand and product for ALL hair types !! also cgm approved :))
16,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of a let down,"So many people following the curly girl method have recommended this shampoo and conditioner that I had to try it. I just wasn't impressed. It left my waves flat and lifeless. Also, I expected this stuff to smell amazing. The scent of the shampoo was very faint floral and the conditioner lacked a scent but somehow managed to smell bad. It's almost as though they forgot to put the scent in the mixture before bottling it. What a let down. I only used it a few times before throwing the bottles away."
17,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Super greasy hair,The product has a great smell and the shampoo works pretty well...it's the conditioner that's the issue.  There is no happy medium...if you don't rinse enough then you have this greasy weird residue in your hair that looks like you didn't wash it. If you rinse too much then it is like you have no conditioner at all. It does not work for my hair at all. I can't stand the feeling of being able to still feel the conditioner in my hair like gel.
18,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I have a lot of skin allergies and so there really isn't that many shampoos i can use. I had used another shampoo in this brand but the price had tripled so I found this set. It smells so good. I don't have curly hair at all - it's very straight but idc. Imma gonna use it anyways. Ha
19,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great everyday wash,Working in a hospital and having curly hair is a difficult balancing act when it comes to frizzy dry hair. I love the smell and fact that I can fully wash my hair everyday without it drying out or getting all frizzy. Nice light scent too. Also if you follow a low poo/cg method these are perfect.
20,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for thin curly hair,Just started my curl journey to better my curls and create healthier hair..well this product got me off to a great start! It is lightweight and allows for my thin hair to have more curl without all the heavy product weighing it down which was causing my curls to be non-existent. I bought this product one year ago and I am just now needing a new bottle. A whole year for one shampoo/conditioner bottle... definitely a great value for my money. Yes I am washing my hair about every 3-4 days. The smell is faint and not too strong for those wondering and I have a super smeller nose so it doesn't bother me at all. Great product! Super approved!

Smells great takes a little more to get it lathered but works good. The conditioner on the other hand smells terrible and it's always right after I start rinsing.

The scent is overly sweet (almost like bubble gum or candy). I purchased on scent alone, and the fact that this brand is cruelty-free.

Cheap packaging and to prevent the fluids from leaking they put packaging tape around the bottles.  For whatever reason it leaves a chemical odor and the stickiness from the tape does not leave the bottle.  Quality does not match the price.

100,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Defines curls so good!,I used this to wash my hair the day after I received it.

101,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Great
102,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for fine-textured hair; good alternative to silicone,"As you'd expect from NYM, it's a well-formulated product. Pleasant to use, smells nice, etc. The conditioner leaves a good occlusive film on the hair and is great at controlling winter static and frizz. I would say it's a medium-heavy conditioner because it takes a LOT of rinsing if you don't want a heavy film, and I've taken to thinning it with water before applying it to my ends because it is just Too Much for my fine-textured hair. Even so, it weighs my strands down pretty badly and makes my curls look really terrible, so I don't use it on days when I wear my curls naturally. I would only recommend it for people with stiffer hair strands and probably a tighter curl pattern.If you like the way silicone conditioners affect your hair, this is a good alternative. The quaternium ingredient provides a very similar slippery feel to the hair and would help make tangles etc more manageable. The advantage is there is no build-up, the effects wash out even with sulfate-free shampoo. However, if you do not like the way silicone conditioners feel in your hair (as I don't) this is not the product for you. It makes my hair feel like plasticy barbie doll hair in exactly the same way dimethicone does. Yuck!"
103,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,CHUNKS of hair falling out!,DO NOT BUY THIS! I lost over 50% of my hair from this product! I am devastated! I had beautiful thick hair and within a month of using the shampoo and conditioner all my hair began falling out IN CHUNKS!!!! I barely have any hair left. You can see through my hair and I have thinning and balding throughout all of my hair. This product was the only think that changed in the month of us. My hair is thin and at this point I may have to shave my hair off. I am not being dramatic. I have cried everyday since discovering this was the issue. I stopped using this product and within a week the hair loss stopped!
104,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pump WTH? Shampoo the bomb,"I love this shampoo. The price doesn't bother me if it does what I want and I like the smell. I read reviews about the pump and thought, ""ok, dumb. Review the product not the pump"", but OH MY GAAWD the pump is the worst. How is anyone suppose to get shampoo out of it? I had to take an old squeeze lid and replace pump. Just a tip for the next person. Shampoo 5 star, pump -1, bringing my review down to a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
105,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,I thought my hair was fried,"I bought this shampoo so I could stop using drug store brands. I loved it! It made my hair soft and smelled so nice. But when my hair dried, it had a weird texture and felt like hay. I thought maybe my hair started to get fried from hot tools or maybe dying my hair too much. I changed my routine and couldn‚Äôt figure out why my hair texture changed over night. I couldn‚Äôt style it, it would be clumped in knots seconds after brushing through, it was heartbreaking. I decided to use a different shampoo one day, and walla! My hair was back to normal. I threw this shampoo out immediately after."
106,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work well for 3c hair,This left my curls pretty flat. Did not moisturize very well. I have ringlet curls and I do not need heavy moisturizing but this was so light that my hair would be frizzy just hours after dry. I also do not like the scent. It barely smells like anything at all and doesn't last either. I would not buy this again.

108,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,No Bueno.,The pumps suck. And the conditioner was like glue.. it wouldn‚Äôt come off! My time in the shower was literally doubled. Only positive thing I can say about this product is that it smells really good.

110,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Grimy & curl enhancing ish,I've always had soft and silky hair. After a severely short hair cut 2 years ago it has started creating these spiral curls. I have been trying curl embracing products to try to help encourage the curl with my silly hair.I've only used this product 3-4 times but my hair feels dirty and grimy all of the time now. It's impossible to brush after when dry and constantly tangles now. These were never problems that I had before.I'm not sure what to do with this product but I don't think I will be counting use anymore.

It makes it easy to cowash, very moisturizing and lots of slip! It smells good but very strong and does triggers my headaches. It don‚Äôt stop me from using it though! That‚Äôs how good it is."
130,Not Your Mother's Naturals Curl Definition Shampoo (2-Pack) - 15.2 fl oz - Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter - Moisturize and Enhance Curls,1.0 out of 5 stars,Rancid shampoo and plastic conditioner,"I wish I was allowed to return this item, but apparently when I ordered it as a subscription you can't return things. I opened it up and the shampoo smells rancid. Definitely not anything floral or tropical that I was expecting. The conditioner (which should smell the same) smells like plastic or latex. Again, not floral, tropical, or even good. I'm hoping it's a bad batch I was given that was expired, since I've used other NYM products and not had this problem. Guess I'll go to the drugstore and buy it in person where I can smell if it's gone bad. I certainly won't buy from this supplier again."
