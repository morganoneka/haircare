   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"
1,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"I have thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and this product didnt do anything for me. It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."
3,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,1 product  Serious curl definition,Very great product for naturals the best I’ve ever tried.
4,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It worked! I have bouncy curls now!,"I never thought I could just let my curls air dry and be done, but with this hair mask that is very much possible! I’m so happy with my purchase! I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"
5,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,ZERO STARS - WORST. SMELL. EVER. And no way to get it out of hair.,I shampooed my hair six times with anothe product and cannot get this horrific smell out of my hair. God help me.
6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Day 1 styling,"Love the hold, definition, and shine it adds to my hair on day 1. If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."
8,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This is now my favorite product. It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."
9,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite hair mask (type 3c/4a/4b hair),"The hair mask is AMAZING... im not a fan of the smell and it does linger in your hair (reminds me of the Aveeno lavender baby lotion) ... BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This actually works !,"So I have the worst dry hair. Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."
11,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,HOLY GRAIL HAIR PRODUCT,"THE HOLY GRAIL CURLY HAIR PRODUCT, PPL!!Everyone go buy this - and then go back and buy it again for anyone you love. This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but didn’t deliver,"I am trying to find something less expensive than Kinky Curls custard. Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."
14,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product.,I have issues with odors ; My friends know not to come around me with smelly ( perfumes soaps deodorant etc.)  this has a nice clean smell and does not linger.
15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."
17,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells amazing, great hold and shine","This stuff is great! I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"
18,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Coco Creme EXCELLENT Product!,I love Carols Daughter products and was happy to see the launch of the Coco Creme line.  I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.
22,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best find for my kinky curls, after 40 years of searching!","I had stopped buying products since nothing seemed to work for my kinky, white-girl curls. I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"
23,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only Carol's Daughter Product I use,"I've purchased Carol's Daughter products in the past and many of them were average, for me.  Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."
25,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous,Been using this product for years Never leave home without it!
26,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Left My Hair Dry & brittle,"After first applying Carol's Daughter Coco Creme to my damp hair I could feel my hair turning hard.  I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."
27,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My Favorite Hair Mask,"I love this deep moisture hair mask for my dry/damaged curly hair. I apply this to my hair every time I wash it, which is usually 2-3 times a week. I leave it on for at least 5 minutes to really moisturize my hair. I love the smell and it makes my hair soft, silky and shiny."
28,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,All that your curls need!!!,"Just amazing!!!!! I've been looking for something like this for so long and I finally found it. This leave in conditioner is perfect for my curls, it softens and moisturizes my hair and the smell  OMG just divine!!! I'm proudly going to say that this is my new creme and I will be trying more of their other products for sure."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."
30,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like old spice, but my hair feels great!","I’ve used the original hair milk in the past and really liked it, so I decided to try the coco creme hair mask.This does not smell like coco or cream or any combination of the two. The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."
31,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rinse Out Type of Hair Mask,"Some of these reviews people been talking about how it doesn't make their hair curl talking like they think it's a leave in conditioner cream. This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."
32,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Winner Hair Gel,I have been trying so many curly hair gel products after mine was discontinued and this one is it! It goes in smoothly. My hair doesn't feel crunchy but looks and feels soft without the frizz. What sold me is my hair doesn't feel gross and tangled when I take a shower after using it. So glad I found a replacement product. Winner
33,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful product! Super dry hair problem solved in first use.,"Since my hair started going gray it has become unmanageable and I’ve been struggling to figure out how to care for it. It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."
34,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Only styling product you need! Goodbye hair spray.,"My curls are so happy! After using Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo and conditioner I used this styling butter. This was the only product I used and there's absolutely no frizz! Very thick butter so a little goes a long way. I pat my finger tips onto the butter and rub into my fingers, and then through my hair. I am a fan!"

When properly moisturized, he has a head full of big gorgeous curls.  Finding the right product for him has been difficult.  So happy to have taken a chance on this mask after reading reviews.  He uses it as a conditioner and as a twice a week overnight mask.  Phenomenal stuff.  Dont hesitate."

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or this is just a bad batch but it’s horrible."

This product is made up of great natural ingredients. It has helped my hair grow and reduces the damage and breakage of my hair compared to the silicone products I was using before. This will forever be my new shampoo and conditioner. It’s healthy and affordable.

We tried these products on a whim and ohemgee. Detangling my girls hair is so fast and easy. Her hair feels soft. This is an amazing product plus it smells great!
39,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Calling All Curly Girls!,"This is an incredible, deeply moisturizing leave-in. It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips. Then I did the same thing at my roots surrounding my face. But the greatest thing was that I didn't habe ti do or add anything else to get defined curls and waves. This is my new go-to. I also bought the conditioner and I am buying the shampoo next."
40,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft and curly.,"I'm still feeling this out but I think I like it.  I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

I am obsessed w the Black Vanilla shampoo & conditioner,  so I decided to try this one and it was like the total opposite.My hair turned out feeling like hay, wouldnt style easily, nor detangle well. Also my scalp was left feeling so dry and itchy I had to run serum through my strands and it was STILL dry...And frizzy and dull!I recommend the Black Vanilla moisture products."

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming. The intensity of the chemical smell plus coconut  did reduced overnight but not enough. To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

Hair is soft when using this. I’ve used this a month now in addition to other products because I don’t like my hair poofy. 1 jar does last me a month with every day use, a little goes a long way with this product. 4 stars because of the price and I can’t give 4.5."

My hair went from mostly moisturized to frizzy, DRY (it actually began to crackle and break), my curl pattern became kinky instead of spirals. This isn't for dry hair. This isn't for anybody's hair, really."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.  I will also be trying the Coco Crème shampoo and conditioner."

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

I can even use it without a conditioner(I try not to!), and it still tames everything down.For me it's worth it, and I hope they never stop making it.

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

Its very moisturizing my looked amazing after i used it. But Oh. My. Gosh. The smell is infuriating it gave me horrible headaches and lasted for days. I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

It isn't overpowering once you wash it all off but when you have it on it feels excessive. I use it about once a week or every two weeks and I really don't find much of a difference in my hair, it gives *some* moisturization but I prefer other masks I've tried."

It's soft- it makes my hair Softer and it's super Moisturizering. For anyone like me who doesn't know what to use on your hair, go to a natural hair salon and get a hair consultation. They're usual free. It's okay to ask a professional. And there is a difference between this - a pudding- the hair Milk (also a great product) a cream."

Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

620,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."
627,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",#1 HALL OF FAME,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,"This conditioner is supposed to be helpful for ""extremely dry hair,"" which is not the case for me--mine tends toward oily.  But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."
628,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thick, coarse, dry, wavy/curly, highlighted hair.  I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."
629,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this curl gel! I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."
631,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I love this! It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I have to say that it worked fantastically.  I used it every day after I got back from the beach or pool, and my hair has stayed soft and pliable.  No noticeable sun, salt or chlorine damage.  I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It kept them defined and smelling good all day. Haven’t noticed any flaking. However, if you use a lot in one section, the curls have like a firm-crisp feeling, but not crunchy, just firm. It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

This one is heavenly!  When you have curls, you don't want heavy products.  This mist smells amazing.  I love how lightweight it is.  I sprayed this on my clean hair, once while damp and again while dry.  My curls were not sticky or stiff, but shiny and smooth.  While I do not have very dry hair, I felt that this mist added a nice amount of hydration to my hair.  I will definitely use this as a refresher for my curls on days that I do not wash my hair.

645,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

The scent of the product is amazing it smells really good. The gel is light weight and does not weigh down hair. The gel cream is a little tacky or sticky when applying but that feeling goes away. I use this product on my natural hair and my weaves and it works well. Also I love the size of the jar you get a lot of product to last you a little while depending on how much you apply.

While I still have frizz, I feel like I'm able to have more days where my hair is down versus it being up in a bun or in a ponytail. I love the smell of the spray and I also like how much product is in the bottle. I'm able to use this to refresh my hair throughout the week or for what I need additional moisture added to my hair. I would definitely get this again because of how much I've been enjoying my curls. I also like how long the mist is when dispensing the product into my hair; one spritz goes a long way."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

I have a 3c/4a hair type and I like to use after I apply my products. i don’t section I just spray right on top and where I feel I need it but mostly focusing on the roots and ends. I even like to apply it at the end of the day after I take it out of my protective styles. It helps aid in my dryness. It takes my curls to a new level of definition making them less frizzy and last longer in my wash and go process. I would love to try more from this line!
651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while.

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

But I love the product so much that I can put up with the smell. I put a good amount of gel on my wet hair as it is long and curly. It sure is gel...slimy and all. But it works. I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

Was hoping this would be perfect for my hair, but when it arrived I realized how strong it smelled....If you read the ingredients list, ""Parfum (Fragrance)"" is surprisingly high up on the list (appears before the stabilizers and all the good fruit extracts), and you can really tell. This stuff has a very strong, sharp artificial scent that, for me, is a total turn off. I'm sensitive to strong fragrances and won't be able to use this at all. So bummed!"

I have super dry, thick, frizzy hair and it works great. I was so glad to finally try their sulfate-free shampoo too. I have been using Deva-Curl NoPoo Shampoo and it works great, but I like to change up my shampoo and not use the same one all the time. This Coco Creme Shampoo feels like it cleans my hair, but doesn’t dry it out at all. I only wash my hair about twice a week, so this bottle lasts a long time for me. You only really need one squirt for medium length hair. Smells great too! Love it!"

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

I don’t have very curly hair so I need product to make the curls happen. I love the smell of this — kind of like coconut.

Even after just one use you can see and feel the results. My hair looks so healthy and has a shine that it didn’t before. This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

My hair is so naturally dry I don't even rinse the conditioner out; I just gently work the conditioner down to my ends and squeeze out the conditioner with the excess water. This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo. The pump is handy. I prefer for my conditioner to have a pump so I can measure each time I use it (3 pumps). I don't know who Carol is or her daughter, but they make some pretty good hair products for curly hair."

The smell of this mask is amazing.  It has a sweet, coconut fragrance that lingers long after rinsing the product out of your hair.  The mask itself is very thick and silky feeling and absorbs quickly into the hair.  Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.  Every time I have used this mask, it has left my hair feeling nourished and smooth.  It also brings a bit of shine back to my hair.  Great product that is made in the USA."

Rhassoul Clay

   shampoo and conditioner for months now, and I really like those.  This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent.

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly. Carol’s Daughter has become by far my favorite line of shampoos and conditioners."

As it has thickened it gets so dried out if she does not condition and wash it everyday. I don't think hair should be washed that often. I wanted something that would help. She has been using this for a couple weeks and I have noticed a softening. It has a coconut, vanilla scent that just smells amazing. I wish it had more natural ingredients, you shouldn't have to pay a price like this for an ingredient list like that. It is nice and thick and lathers well and is ok for color treated hair."

But don’t hold that against the company! If you have dry, damaged, processed hair, this conditioner is a lifesaver. It is probably one of the only hair products I’ve used that has resulted in a visible improvement in my hair. I have long highlighted hair which has never been the healthiest from years of color. Using this conditioner regularly for the past few weeks has made my hair look healthier and shinier. Even the ends (currently way overdue for a trim) are less split. And it smells like heaven!

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours. So the idea of a moisturize and conditioner in one was enticing. But the problem with this product is that it contains alcohol, and that, as most people know, dries your hair. So it is counter intuitive... the benefits of the coconut oil get erased by the drying factor of the alcohol. Oh well."

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.) My thick, curly hair absorbed it well enough, though the product is a bit thin. My hair, once dry, looks nice, but I have difficulty with the wet comb-through.  With a conditioner that works well, I can comb my wet hair easily.  So this product is a bit of a disappointment."

Some, like this conditioner, I like less than others.My hope was for a light cocoa butter-ish smell and that it would work for my daughter's leaning-toward-oily hair. Sadly, the scent is very strong and sickeningly sweet (I do have sensitive sinuses) while it enhances the oiliness of her hair. She only used it a few times before we had to stop. I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

It does contain coconut oil, milk, murumuru and mango butters, which hydrate and nourish the hair. It has a light and refreshing coconut scent. In addition, this wonderful shampoo comes in any easy-to-use pump bottle for your convenience. It is fairly priced for an excellent, concentrated shampoo.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."

780,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Working great,Ideally I was hoping to find a fully vegan shampoo for curly hair but since I've had a good experience with the Carol's daughter hair honey I thought I'd give this a shot and it does seem to give my hair some needed moisturization and others have said my hair looks more voluptuous so guess it's a keeper.

827,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dry after effect on hair,It has a good slip and gave good curl definition . But after I crunch out the cast it leaves my hair feeling dry not soft. I did try using less. But still get the dry texture. Not for me. 🙃😕
828,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST CONDITIONER,"This has been by far the best conditioner I have ever tried. I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Quenching Deep Moisture Hair Mask for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Hair Mask for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

La consistencia del shampoo es un poco espesa y con muy poco es suficiente, el acondicionador está muy bien y deja un agradable olor."

This and the Monoi Carol’s Daughter masks are really good. Don’t get the almond one though. It’s thick, and it makes your hair silky! If you have frizzy hair, you’ll still need something for your ends when your hair is dry, like Schwarzkopf for Ends."
0,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok.... the smell and thickness are 🤭,I typically like Carol’s Daughter’s oils. My go to used to be the Sacred Tiara until it was discontinued. This is just ok. It has great ingredients but it smells like dirt. And the smell lingers. It’s thicker so it does make my hair oily. Don’t think I will get this again.
1,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair loves this!!,"Since this product is unscented it will sort of amplify whatever you already have on your hair; This has such a gentle sweet smell to me, I almost can't describe it. My hair absolutely loves this product! Very moisturizing, nice viscosity to work with, and easy to get down to the roots! My hair has grown half an inch in just a month, which is amazing to me. You won't regret it!"
2,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible horrible smell,"I liked the rest of the ingredients in this, so I took a risk and bought a bottle. Tried it at home and immediately started gagging from the strong smell. It's a very strong peppery-fruit fragrance and it does not go away. I disliked it so much that I had to shower after trying to wait two hours for the scent to dissipate. I would advise using another hair oil since the fragrance is too strong in this one."
3,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to get past the scent,"If you can handle the scent, it works at keeping most of my frizzies away. It is very overpowering to me.  I first tried it on my scalp, and it was just too greasy at the roots with dryness in the ends. I have a lot of hair, but I just use a tiny bit in the palm of my hand (maybe a little more than a pea-size amount) and work it through starting with my ends and blending, blending, scrunching. It works best for me if I wash my hair later in the day, and when it's still a little damp, put on the product and wrap it in a loose bun all night. This photo is first thing in the morning after I let my hair down from the bun."

After three days my scalped felt like it burn sometimes. I havent put it on since and its been about 2 days, my scalped still feels like it burns in some areas. The dry patches are still there but i suspect they are chemical burns. This might not happen to everyone, recommend trying a small area for a couple of days to make sure its okay to use."

6,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than argon oil,"I have very thin hair strands and a ton of it. No matter the humidity in the air, it is frizzy and poofy.  I have been using argon oil for the last few years and it worked fine. This product, however, seems to work much better and more so the day after washing my hair. On wash day, I use a little more than the diameter of a pencil eraser (chin length hair), rub my hands together working my fingers around scrunching/smoothing where needed and I let my hair air dry. The next day and a day after, just a tiny bit is needed to tame the frizzies and soften the waves. This oil seems lighter than the argon oil hence any slight overage didn't cause major strand clumping.  The scent is nice and isn't overwhelming, at least with the amount I use."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The smell is not pleasant,"Decided to throw this item away; the smell/scent is not what I want on my hair. So I did not use it based on the odor/scent. It was difficult trying to wash the smell/scent off my fingers.  I would not recommend this product based on the item description. I am sure that all of its ingredients truly benefit the hair, Also, I could not determine what hair texture or hair type this products is beneficial for.  No hair product should leave a lingering smell that is unpleasant to smell."

I had long frizzy, 3a/3b hair and for the longest I didn’t use anything other than conditioner and gel! I’ve tried a lot of different things, but this smell combined with the way the products feel on my hair and scalp are amazing. My curls feel light, bounce and SHOCKINGLY stopped breaking off and splitting my ends. The moisture loss problem has also stopped, so after I had to do a big chop because of my damage, this stuff and scalp massages have my hair growing like sea weed.This stuff smells like the body oil OSEA so if you don’t like lemon mixed with seaweed, sunshine and sea salt smell, just take a hard no on this… you will smell like summer and I guess that bothers some people!Love love love this stuff."

Buy it all uou won't be dissatisfied."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair fell out,"So excited to get this product because of the reviews, used it as soon as it came. A few hours later felt the back of my head and a patch of my hair had fallen out. The product did not have a protective plastic seal. So not sure if it is the actual product as produced by Carol's Daughter or if the oil had been replaced."
11,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Makes hair oily and doesn’t smell great,"I have natural thin crazy curly frizzy hair. I was hoping this would help control my frizz (atleast a little) and not make my hair look oily. It so hard to find a good product. I was hopeful for this to work for me but it wasn’t what I hoped for. It smells horrible, doesn’t help at all with my frizz and it makes my hair super oily. I know when you use oil you use just a small amount but any amount of this just makes my hair smelly and oily. I wish this would of worked."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a loooong way,"It does help with scalp itchiness with my braids but it has an overwhelming patchouli-like scent. After I applied this to my scalp, all of my hair was oily within 10 minutes. I have very long, bleached and color treated straight hair. Even after I shampooed, my hair had an oiliness to it. This is probably best for very coarse and dry hair."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry hair,"I had been searching a LONG time for a moisturizing oil to use after I wash my hair. My hair is extremely dense, 3b-4a. It gets dry easily as I’m pregnant now and my hair is just way drier than it’s ever been before. I normally do braid outs. I use this oil on my scalp after I finish my braids and every other day as needed while my braids are in. It keeps my hair moisturized and shiny and healthy. It also smells really good. I’m happy with it and I’m going to continue purchasing this oil."
14,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells awful,"I was so incredibly excited to try this. Especially after I had just discovered the Mimosa pomade which smells like heaven. What I was looking for was an oil for my dry scalp that wouldnt make my hair look greasy but was moisturizing. So far it appears to be helping with the moisture issue which is awesome. But the smell of it...its strong and it lingers. It is very peppery, like peppery dirt is how I'd describe it. Its got to be the cumin in it which I'd hoped wouldn't be noticeable but it overpowers the other products in my hair and for the rest of the day all I can smell is that peppery dirt smell. I even put some drops of peppermint oil into it (which honestly that stuff is so strong it could overpower most smells) and it didn't help at all. Unfortunately I'm gonna have to look for a new oil even if this one does what I was looking for."
15,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Chemical Burns on hairline and scalp.,"I wanted to like this product, in fact I bought a secind bottle after finishing the first until I realized it was the reason for my scalp and edges developing red splotches like from a chemical burn (I know bc I used to relax my hair and have suffered chemical burns before). After halting use in my other creams and oils this was the last thing, and after I stopped use the red patches went away around my hairline. It definetly has a strong spice smell to it (the ginger) and it is possible for vertain herbs and spixes ro burn your skin, My scalp was just too sensitive for it I suppose. It did moisturize my scalp and hair, but the burns wrapped it up for me. Onto the next I suppose. I wouldnt use it on a child or for someone with sensitive skin."
16,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for locs,This oil was the best thing to happen to my locs but then comes thieves/maintenance repairs and now I have to order more. I guess my Carol's Daughter hair milk styling foam will have to do for my retwist. Oh no it's running low lol but I have enough for this Saturday night. ; )
17,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight moisturizing oil, reduces shedding","I have fine, dense, Type 4a-4c hair.... and my hair LOVES it. I actually like the scent, and It's moisturizing but not a heavy oil. And the best part?! My shedding has reduced significantly."
18,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,I cannot tolerate the smell,"I don't understand how some are describing the smell as perfume and pleasant. It stinks! I hate it. It has a strong ""dirt"" or cigar smell that never goes away until I rewash my hair. I will never buy any of the goddess products again. The shampoo and conditioner also smells like this. A waste of my money. In the trash all 3 will go."
19,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the scent for me,"I like the ease at which the oil comes from the bottle but the scent....I really don’t like the scent. I should have thought of that since it has cumin seeds in it and I don’t like the smell of cumin, but I was focused on a getting a good oil. I will say, I don’t smell it today after using it on my daughter yesterday."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too strong a sweet perfume-y scent that is difficult to get over!,"I have used this only once so far. The bottle is small. The oil consistency seems ok. I am hoping it will deliver results. Too early to tell. I am not finicky about scents but man, this is just way too strong and sweet and perfume-y even for me and I can't seem to get over that. I might look to dilute it with other oils like sweet almond oil just so the scent becomes bearable. I had heard about the brand but now I will be careful buying anything from this brand. If you are someone who is sensitive to scents, stay away from this oil. I don't think I will order this again."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,GOTS TO BE THE BEST,"I have severe dry skin, scalp issues .. and Lord knows what else.

22,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great feeling,"This oil works very well and absorbs into my scalp very well. I don't like oils that sit of top. I have locs, so I am very careful not to use certain products that may make my hair flake. I don't have to apply this very often, which is another positive."
23,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the smell,Definitely not a light oil. Will weigh down your hair immediately. I haven't used on the scalp yet. Had surgery on my head about 6 months back and it traumatized my scalp causing extreme hairless. I bought the oil for the ends and to eventually run on my scalp to stimulate regrowth. It is greasy but it is oil.
24,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this hair/scalp oil!!!,"This stuff is just what I was looking for! I've tried all the others, and none come even close to this product. I love the smell and texture of this oil, worked into my hair and scalp and felt instant relief from dry hair and itchy dry scalp, also tamed my curls just right!!! Very light and pleasant, not heavy, not greasy! I love it!!! Thank you"
25,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good oil for moisture,I didn't care for the 7 oil blend oil at all. It didn't seem to really moisturize my hair much at all. The scent is okay. It smells like a pencil. I wouldnt buy this product again. Its definitely pretty pricey for a item that didn't seem to be great at all.
26,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works on thin curly hair,I have been using this product for a few days now and it has left my hair soft and manageable every time!!

27,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,"I use this product on my locs when retwisting and it did wonders for my scalp and hair. I initially hated the sweet smell but I realized that after the sweet smell subsidied, I could smell hints of castor oil which I like. My scalp itches alot and this helps with the itching. It's a good product. Money well spent!!"
28,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Scent too strong, hard to wash out, broke skin out","I found the fragrance offensive, too strong and fake. It feels light and easy to apply, however it broke the skin out around my hairline and does not wash out easily leaving my hair limp. Not great for fine hair or anybody acne prone."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,"This is my 2nd time ordering this oil. I started my Loc journey almost a year ago & wanted to try an oil by a familiar brand. It smells great, last for a long time (use 2 - 3 times a week). Does not weigh my hair down.  Great product if you have locs."

I usually oil my hair after my shower, let it soak, then brush and all other oils work with my thick long hair.

41,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Works but smelly.,My hair was pretty dry with the sun. Left this on for a day but had to wash out. The smell is very strong. Feels like someone blew smok right into my hair. That being said it did leave my hair hydrated and better than before. And it’s just oils so I think I will add lavender or something to it that smells better.
42,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Superior blend of all the right oils!,"I bought this product for my son and me, because we are both new to Locs and needed a nourishing oil for our crowns.  Carol’s Daughter has a superb mix of healthy, organic ingredients.  It is all at once easy to apply to our scalps, moisturizing (not sticky or waxy), and smells wonderful.  Now the whole family uses it!  It also feels great supporting a small business that started right here in BK, as well!"

This has brought my scalp back to life and helps provide moisture even when I have a weave in. Usually weaves would leach moisture from my scalp or it was difficult for it to penetrate deep enough.

It had this artifical herbal scent. It also was not very moisturizing. I use the L.O.C. method for my child's hair and had to mix this with a thicker oil for it to do the job. I would suggest buying something naturally scented from a different brand.

243,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My fair is straight, fine, and especially tends to fly away during the cold dry winter months.  I color my hair but I don't perm it.  I'm also getting older (late 50s) and hair doesn't get any better with age.  I chose this because it's for weak, breakage-prone hair although it's applied to the scalp and then massaged into the scalp and hair.  I like the results of using this although I'm still learning how much to apply.  I started with just a few drops on my scalp and then a few drops more.  It seemed to take a while to get it properly distributed through my hair and I'm not sure it ever reached the ends which are just below my shoulders.  I may have to modify how I apply it to include the ends.  Still, this has nicely tamed my flyaways and unruly hairs so my hair looks much better.  I like the wholesome ingredients which include sunflower seed oil, olive fruit oil, jojoba seed oil, coconut oil, black cumin seed oil, castor seed oil, flax linseed oil, soybean oil, and the other ingredients to keep this stable.  The oil does have a bit of a yellow cast to it but with the small amount needed, there's no impact to that.  I rate this at 4 stars because of the oil's wholesomeness and it works. It's just a bit of 'trial and error' to figure out how to properly get this distributed through my hair for the correct effect without excessive oiliness around the roots."
244,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally reversed my post partum shedding!,"Add this to a quality cold pressed castor oil, and it will change your life in just a few weeks. Better than any prescription product. Life changing for my post partum shedding. My hair was falling out in CLUMPS 3 months after giving birth. I started putting a few drops of both castor oil and the goddess oil on each temple where the hair was receding (I keep them separate, don’t mix together in same bottle).  About 17 days later, and tons of baby hairs are regrowing. That bald spot is almost completely filled in. I also put just the goddess oil all over my scalp (has an applicator tip) at the same time and I do this process about every 2 days. The goddess oil is super light and will be absorbed by morning. It won’t be visible but you’ll still need a shower. It smells AMAZING. Very, VERY happy with the success! Thank you Carol’s Daughter."
245,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This oil is great to moisturize natural hair and your scalp. My husband stopped using relaxers about a year ago and just did a big chip, taking off about 4 to 5 inches of the old relaxed hair. It has been a lot of trial and error to find products to keep his hair moisturized and feeling good since stopping the relaxers and going natural. He has very thick, very dense 4c hair that is very dry. This oil helps a ton. The scent isnt bad. More of a light, natural scent. Doesnt take too much work to wash it out, but does protect against drying it out too much when washing."
246,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This hair oil is oily!It’s recommended to use this after shampooing and conditioning on damp or dry hair.I washed my hair as normal but didn’t use the same brand as the hair oil.After towel drying my hair I used the tip of the bottle to apply this directly to my scalp.The oil is easy to apply - there were a couple areas I applied a little too much and I had some dripping down my face/neck.I personally don’t enjoy the smell of the hair oil.It’s recommended to leave the oil in and style your hair as usual - my hair turned into a pile of grease near my scalp! Luckily it was a cold day and I could wear a stocking hat as I didn’t have time to rewash my hair.In the future I will use this as a treatment before shampooing. Then use shampoo and conditioner to wash the oil out.My scalp had been itchy prior to using the hair oil and after using my itch was minimized significantly.**If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below."
247,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Is it me or is it the oil?,"I notice this entry seems to have conditioner, shampoo and hair oil; to clarify, I received the hair oil via Vine.Looking more carefully at the product, it seems like this MAY be intended for those with curly/natural hair. My hair is thick and wavy, going past my shoulders, but it is not the coarse texture you might find in natural hair. So please keep this in mind when reading my review.As stated above, I have past the shoulder length thick hair which has been professionally relaxed, professionally colored. It can dry out quite easily, so adding oil is essential to keep the ends from breaking. I've tried many a hair oil, from rose serum to argan to moroccan, so when I saw this, I figured I would give it a go.The instructions say to apply to the scalp; I've had experience in the past with applying oil to the scalp and feeling greasy until my next shower, so this time, I was VERY conservative with how much applied. I barely squeezed the tube and only put some in three areas: part, left and right side of my head. Then I really got in there and massaged it into my scalp.The smell is quite pungent and not exactly pleasant. I've tried Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Leave in Conditioner, and while I liked the results of the product, I struggle to use the product up because of the smell. This oil leaves me with the same feeling - I absolutely have to apply a scent to cover up this oil.I've used this nearly a week now (I know, I know, you need like a month to see if there are results), but I can't say I see much improvement. Is that because I didn't need the improvement or because it's not working for me? You be the judge.Obviously, I'm going to keep trying this out, but I doubt I would continue buying this. I have a good slew of products already at my disposal; however, maybe this will work for you, especially if you have a coarse hair texture."
248,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I like the applicator top for this oil. It makes it easy to apply directly to my scalp, or I can put a little on my fingertips and rub onto my scalp. If too much is applied, then it will make your hair very oily. The scent is not overbearing it actually is pleasant and light smelling. Great for dry scalp. Recommended."
249,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This oil is designed to be used after shampooing and conditioning. My fine hair has become dry and prone to breaking due to overprocessing. I have reversed the process since it makes my roots oily and it has an odd spicy aroma, more like a salad dresding or spice rub than a hair care product. I massage it into my scalp at night, put on a shower cap and go to bed. The next morning I shampoo and condition. Hair looks healthier and shiny and feels gookd. My scalp has definitely shown improvement. It was dry and itchy and is much less so."
250,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,this stuff is magical,"okay so, i’ve been using the goddess strength hair and scalp oil for about 2 weeks and i’m in love. for reference i’m biracial (black and white) with 3B/3C hair texture. i was having A LOT of scalp issues and i was about to go to a dermatologist about it because it was bad. for months (like at least 4) chunks of my scalp would flake off in the center of my head and leave scabs, hurt like a mother-, and i’ve tried hair oils, masks, leave in conditioner, natural remedies, EVERYTHING AND NOTHING WORKED. tried Carol’s Daughter and my scalp is healthy no flakes, no scabs,no nothing. My hair smells amazing and i have less breakage after washing. My hair is strong, shiny and healthy. it even seems longer but i’m sure that’s all in my head. trust me try this and you won’t be disappointed."
251,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,I actually take black seed oil daily for the benefits that it helps me with. It’s considered the “cure all but death” supplement.It will probably be the worst tasting thing you take on purpose but it’s amazing.This hair oil actually has it in it and you can definitely smell it in the product. Keep that in mind when you’re applying it to your scalp.I did get some relief when I applied it on my scalp especially with the ever so changing temperatures and weather that we’ve been having here in Florida.You will want to spritz your hair afterwards to mask the smell of this hair scalp oil.
252,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"WHOA, this stuff smells STRONG!  It actually smells pretty good. It kinda smells like candy, like sort of like a fruit snack or licorice, a little spicy scented, yet sweet. But the fragrance is simply too powerful! I only put a few tiny drops on top of my head to test it, and I kept smelling it everywhere I went for the rest of the day. I think if you used an efficient amount of this, that it might knock some people down if you got too close. I might suggest that you dilute this in your own carrier oils!!!Another thing that I don't feel comfortable with, is that this is not advertised as containing hexane free castor oil and as someone who has many years of knowledge and experience with natural health and skin care, it is my understanding that it is very important to use only hexane free castor oil!"
253,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for dryness,"We have an elderly aunt who lives with us. She can't do a lot of things for herself, including hair care. She doesn't like to shampoo very often, and you'd think that would lead to oiliness, but it's just the opposite for her -- her hair and skin gets dry and brittle. So we massage this scalp/hair oil into her skin and hair in the morning a few times a week. She has issues with itchy scalp and dry hair and this helps her. She doesn't scratch as much and her hair looks more natural. The price is good for what you get.The oil does have a natural, kind-of-nutty fragrance, which isn't a scent you'd normally associate with hair products, at least in the USA. It's not a bad smell, though, and doesn't really linger long, but I figure I'd better mention it."

It is a problem a lot of times to just keep it looking somewhat healthy. I do not have curly hair, but my daughter has type 3a. It has been a big learning curve to take care of her hair and keep it curly instead of frizzy. Hair oil is critical. This one is a little heavy for every day use for type 3a, but it is awesome when we do what we call oil braids. We put her hair oil in, braid her hair, and leave it for a day or two. Then we wash, condition, and voila...looks amazing! We usually do this once per week, and he hair looks amazing. We just used this one for the first time, and we love it. It smells wonderful, too. The bottle is HUGE and will last for a really long time. I am thrilled. Great hair oil!"
255,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is easy to use, just a small amount in your hand and apply to scalp and pull though to ends.  Adds a nice shine to your hair and leaves it , at least for me, extra soft.  The scent is pleasant and fades rather quickly so you don’t smell it all day long.  You can warm this up a bit before putting in your hair and it feels lovely..  I had no scalp / skin irritations, rashes, etc. when using."

It’s very effective, but when the jar ran out, I looked to see if the company made anything else for dry mature hair like mine.  This scalp oil is wonderful, and just like the mimosa pomade, only a tiny bit is needed to add shine, texture and moisture.  I like that it can be applied to dry or wet hair—both ways make my hair feel and look good again.  It takes some practice finding how much is right for your hair though—too much will make hair look greasy.  Just the right amount makes hair look healthy and more vibrant.  The added bonus with both products is the wonderful fragrance."

I couldn’t figure out why my hair was thinning, I tried everything to figure out. I’ve been using carols daughter products for over a year. I decided to switch my hair products to see if that fixed my hair thinning problems, after using a different brand of shampoo my hair began growing and I experienced way less fall out. I believe it was Carols daughter products making my hair thin very quickly. Please do not buy!"

I didn't care too much for the light scent of the oil, and this is just me, but I didn't enjoy slathering the oil onto my hair and scalp. It was an extra step beyond shampoo and conditioning that I just don't have much time for, although it did a great job of making my hair feel healthier though.  If your hair requires extra treatment, this would work well for you."

I used this product after washing, conditioning and drying my hair and my scalp felt like it was in heaven! The oil has a very nice smell. It isn't greasy and is light weight. My hair has a nice sheen to it and doesn't look dry like it normally does after blow drying.  Plus my scalp is nice and hydrating. This is my first time ever using this brand and I am very impressed with this product so far."

Conditioners leave my hair matted so I avoid them.  This scalp oil is meant to be used after shampoo as a leave in treatment.  I knew that wouldn't work for me but I got the oil to use it overnight.  It smells great and is silky to the touch.  I leave it in overnight, shampoo, rinse and I'm good.  My hair isn't matted instead it is moisturized and shiny.  I'm going to need more than the one bottle!"
262,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Use it as a hair mask and then wash it out!,My daughter has super curly hair that turns frizzy and breaks during the winter unless treated properly. This bottle is basically hair oil with a light pleasant smell. It is however very greasy the first time I used a tiny amount on her hair and it ended up a greasy oily mess. The best way to use it is to put it in like a hair mask for ten minutes then wash it out using regular shampoo. When I did this my daughters lovely curls came back!

I found a way to use it: I apply it before bed and massage it well into my scalp and roots, put on a shower cap and then wash my hair thoroughly in the morning. I believe it's making my hair stronger and moisturises my scalp, but I can't say that I love it."
264,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,smells awful,Deep regret at purchasing this.  This smells like a tobacco barn.  Like a tobacco pipe or chewing tobacco.  All I can think is this must have been scented by people who are too young to remember smoking and non smoking sections and how awful restaurants and planes used to smell.  Or by smokers.  My hair smells like a spittoon and even using a highly scented shampoo hasn't gotten rid of it.

She showers, washes her hair, dries it, and then when her hair is fully dry, my wife puts in the scalp oil blend. It is gentle on her scalp, it minimizes flaking, and gives her relief from the itching. If you're looking for a scalp oil blend for dry scalps, I can give 7 Oil Blend Scalp Oil a strong recommendation."

My hair, which is naturally very long and thick, had started to get very dry. And no matter how much leave-in conditioner I used, the dryness wouldn't go away, and the breakage continued. Then I discovered this product and decided to give it a try.My hair has never been so well moisturized! This oil leaves my hair shiny and silky smooth to the touch without being greasy/oily. Lots of people complain about the smell, and I too, found the smell of this oil to be a little too strong when I first started using it. But I've grown used to the scent now, and hardly notice it anymore. Plus, the scene lightens up after use; it doesn't linger in your hair forever.Highly recommended."
279,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This oil is perfect with the proper regimen.,"Having 4C hair is usually a struggle when it comes to finding the right products, especially when you have low porosity hair. I normally make my own oil but I haven't had the time lately. Store bought oils are usually either really heavy and my hair won't process them, it will be greasy and brittle at the same time. The other oils are too thin and watery, this one worked perfectly for me. I combine it with the Coco Creme Coil enhancer, and it leaves my hair feeling soft, smelling really nice, and very easy to manage."

They have either changed the recipe or the product I recieved had gone rancid. It was not its usual buttery color but rather a stark white. The consistency was that of the kids play slime. It did not have its usual soothing vanilla scent. It was more of a chemical vanilla. I stopped using the Black Vanilla shampoo last year for the same reason guess this product is off of my shopping list also.

I've decided that although the formula might have changed, it still had some positive changes on my hair. Morning after and my hair looked shinier and softer (although didn't felt thag soft, just looked). It also had a nice scent left on it. My hair is dyed (wasn't in the past), straight and fine.---I was first introduced to this product a few years back when I found it at my local TJ Maxx. After the first try, I fell in love. The smell was fantastic and I could immediately see a difference after using the product as directed in the back label. I purchased it through Amazon recently, but even the color of the product itself was different (before was more of a darker cream color and now was much closer to a white). It still smelled good but not as great as before, it was a much lighter scent. Regarding results, my hair was left smelling nice and vanilla-y but I can't tell any difference other than that, whereas before I could tell how soft my hair became from using it. Perhaps a change in formula caused this considerably different experience."

It actually kind of felt like straw after i rinsed it out. I will use up the container since i purchased it but i will not buy again. There are way better deep conditioners for the same price point.
7,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good! But I still prefer Sacred Tiare,"Scent: I tried this because vanilla is my all-time fav scent. Unfortunately, the smell isn't as amazing as, say Warm Vanilla Sugar from Bath and Body Works. But, it's def not bad. And it's not a super strong smell, so I don't think it'll offend anyone but the most staunch vanilla-haters.Softness/Shininess: My main concern for my hair is improving luster. I figured this would be about the same or better than Sacred Tiare (my intro to Carol's Daughter products). I have 2B hair (with some 2A and 2C) that's not terribly dry, but it does get somewhat frizzy and dull randomly. Sacred Tiare was a godsend for my hair; it made my hair super shiny and super soft after 1 use. This product hasn't had quite the same magical effect, but it has made my hair shinier and softer than if I hadn't used the product. I think I would need to use a lot more of this or leave it in a lot longer (not sure... I'll try both) to get the same results as a tiny bit of Sacred Tiare.Overall: I will be keeping this jar, but I won't be buying it again. I will go back to Sacred Tiare once I finish with this."

10,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,My Favorite Conditioner,"My hair can't be without this conditioner.  I use it every other time I wash my hair so I don't get build up. I hand comb to dry my straight, frizzy, damaged hair and this stuff has good slick to do that. I shampoo, leave this in for a min 10 minutes, rinse, and use argan oil afterward. I give a lot of credit to the wheat germ oil in it. I've always used conditioners with that ingredient in them.This also works for my friend who has fine, super curly hair. She doesn't like weight, so she washes it out completely. An all over wonderful product for our frizzy hair."

15,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,It worked!,Ok.  Call me impressed!  I love the scent of these black vanilla products.  I tried the travel size shampoo and leave in with no results.  I tried the hair milk.. Nothin.  I tried this smoothie expecting failure.  At last I was wrong.  Small bottle for the price.  Weird texture and I only had to use a lil.  Goes on smooth. I parted my hair in the center and each side into quarters. I put on a platic cap I kept it in overnight.  My hair was soooo soft it was unreal.  I have 4b/c low porosity natural hair.  I think if I add a heat cap the results will be even better. My hair was volumimous yet smooth.

252,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Deep Conditioner,"For the price, this product is very hard to beat. I've used a lot of high-end conditioners and this is on par with many of them. My hair is caucasian, thick, color treated many times over, almost halfway down my back, and in need of a trim. My ends are pretty crispy, but I hide it pretty well with all my various smoothing products. (My hair takes forever to grow and trims only seem to make the problem worse.) The consistency is creamy and thick and even on my long hair, I don't use very much so I expect this container to last a while. I don't notice any significant fading of my hair (currently light blondish reddish copper). I have been using this in conjunction with the Black Vanilla shampoo and they pair well together. Since my hair is dry, I use this as my regular conditioner (I usually wash my hair about twice a week).The scent is a warm, creamy vanilla...if you remember the original Glade vanilla scent from back in the day, this is pretty much that scent exactly. It isn't too noticeable when it dries, which I prefer when it comes to sweet smells like this in my hair.I squeeze the water out of my hair in the shower, massage this in to the lower half of my hair, and let it sit while I do all my other stuff, occasionally rubbing it in to help keep the hair from getting too cold and closing the cuticle. My hair is very silky when I rinse it out, and after drying and straightening it's very soft and healthy feeling. My ends are still slightly dry so I do use a tiny dab of a smoothing treatment on my very ends after styling as a finishing touch, but I could get away with just the hair smoothie if I needed to.For even better results, put a shower cap on after massaging this into your hair and use the hair dryer for about 5 minutes, then let sit until the hair starts to cool and then rinse out.This is a friggin' bargain for the results, and I especially appreciate that the formula is not loaded with waxes and dimethicone which just coat your hair to give the illusion that it's healthy / shiny while blocking real conditioning ingredients from being able to penetrate the hair shaft, leaving your hair in increasingly worse condition. This contains a lot of natural oils and cocoa butter that would benefit pretty much everyone of all ethnicities and hair types except those with super greasy hair. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to others as a great deep conditioning treatment."
253,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"My beautiful 16"" silky hair quickly became a 10"" mane of ...","A few hours ago, I purchased this product at my local Sally's Beauty Supply store. Since last November I had been experimenting with different colors on my hair because of emotional trauma I am still currently going through. I often use my hair as a getaway.So, wanting to get away as dramatically as possible, this past March I went from my natural African-American black hair to a honey-blonde on my own. I had always done my own color jobs and they have turned out perfectly, but the bleach is what sent my hair into ruins. My beautiful 16"" silky hair quickly became a 10"" mane of hard, dry, split ended, frustrating hair as it broke off terribly. Everyone has asked if I cut my hair, and I just lie and reply the affirmative.Anyway, after seeing a random advertisement for Carol's Daughter on Facebook, and coincidentally clicking on a link to their webpage, I decided to try this product. Seeing as I was close to shaving my head, I knew I couldn't go wrong. After wetting my hair and applying the smoothie throughout it, then putting on a plastic cap, I let it sit in my hair for about 3 hours. I washed it out and then co-washed with my normal conditioner. I blow dried and straightened my hair, and I have to say it doesn't even feel like the hair I woke up sadly to this morning! It's actually shiny and soft and...bouncy! My hair hasn't been bouncy since March! It almost feels like my hair that I had back in November. As I continue to use this product, I will update my review in about a month or so as I use it to deep condition every week until then. I have to say, this hair smoothie may just be my hair savior in a jar!"

My hair was looking drier than normal even after conditioning.  I thought I would try this and have used it for a few days now as a leave-in conditioner and what a difference.  I use just a little, rub between my hands and apply it to towel dried hair.  It does not weigh it down.  My hair was immediately soft and shiny after just day one.  No static from the very low humidity and my hair looks and feels great.  I have not tried it as a rinse out conditioner but as a leave in it works great."

I also do not have to use a ton of it to get the desired results, the 8oz goes along way. I give extra bonus points because I really like the smell."

I love the way it feels on my hands as I apply it to my freshly washed hair.  I let it sit in my hair for about 30 minutes and when I rinsed it out, my hair looked beautiful (shiny) and was really moisturized.  I much prefer this over the Argan Oil that I (wasted my money on) purchased last month.  This will be my new staple for deep conditioning my hair!  I purchased this from my local Target.  Give it a try! Thank you Carol's Daughter!  A success!"

262,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dang near perfect,"I found this brand by accident while on a work trip and didn't want to travel with a half empty bottle of shampoo. This is a line that smells amazing, the hair smoothie works miracles on the first try (after a horrendous dye accident that destroyed my hair and made it so dry), and is decently priced. My only complaint is that you have to use a bit more shampoo at one time than normal shampoos, but it always feels clean and looks shiny so it's definitely not a deal breaker. I hope this line never dies out."

281,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,TL;DR: Turned my bird lady hair into something presentable!,"I was very pleasantly surprised. I had frizzy, extremely dry hair that stayed dry at the ends no matter how much conditioner I slathered on. I occasionally would put oil on my hair to control the frizziness and static, but I don't like how my hair feels after using it (greasy, heavy, etc) so I don't use it much. I searched for what seemed like hours for the right deep conditioner (because apparently there are a million different types, and they all do different things) and I came across this and decided to just give it a go. I mean, it can't get much worse, right?When opened the package, it was sealed up and nothing was spilling out, so that's a good sign. I noticed that it definitely had a shea butter or coconut oil consistency, and I wasn't sure if this would be a good thing or a bad thing. The smell is fantastic. To me, it smells like a candle; my husband said I smelled like cookies. After my shower, I decided to just go for the kill and skip using it as regular conditioner: I put it on the ends of my damp hair and put on a shower cap and turned on my blow-dryer. I sat on my bathroom floor blow-drying for 10 minutes, and after the 10 minutes was up, I rinsed well and went about my day.I noticed that my hair dried slower than it normally does and that it felt a little sticky, but it wasn't uncomfortable. After it dried, I could tell a difference. My normally frizzy and tangled hair was really silky and soft.  Like, TV-level soft and smooth. It didn't knot as easily, and I even noticed that my natural wave was more prominent. I really like this stuff. I think I'll continue to buy. And the best part: I smell like cookies!"
282,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Use as Hair Gel,"I am in the military and have to slick my hair back in uniform. Using the hair gel is tough on my hair and frankly feels gross. So I use this to slick my hair back and it works really well. I have to put on a helmet throughout the day and there's never any flacking like with gel. Also, i use this when I'm styling my hair and need something to keep my flyaways down I use this and only this. Great product, It's a different formula now than when I started using the product, which I think the old version is way better the new formula still gets the job done."

The shampoo made my hair feel brittle, the spray conditioner did the same, I threw it away. I just tried the smoothie the other day, because I know that sometimes different products in a line work better than others. It was wasn't good to, or for my natural hair. The product sat on my hair, opposed to melding with my strands. I did not use very much. I had to wash it out. If it works for other's natural hair, or processed hair, good on them. This is not a product I will ever be buying again. I really dislike wasting my money."

I'm really sick of Carol's Daughter constantly changing the formulas for their products. I use alot of their stuff and it's gotten to the point where whenever I order something I have no idea what I am going to get. They've also changed their leave in and replenishing oil multiple times as well as the shampoo and conditioner.I just received this product in the mail and it smells like literal water with a barely noticeable hint of vanilla. My last bottle smelled fantastic. I'm not sure whether Carols Daughter altered the formula, or if the seller diluted it, but something is different and I am reluctant to put it in my hair."
1,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,They have changed the formula!!!,"This new oil is dry and drying. It does not add any moisture to black hair. It's is just a super thin layer of chemicals with an approximation of the original scent. I was expected to get moisturizing hair oil. This is is not moisturizing at all, even though the packaging is the same. Do not get the array of chemicals in the spray bottle. You will be better off preparing your own formulation with almond oil, vanilla, coconut oil (liquid form), and some calendula oil. This is not really Carol's Daughters as we knew it many years ago. So, for long-time lovers of Carol's daughter, this product false packaging and false advertising, and it not prepared for natural African-American hair texture--maybe weaves or braids, but not natural hair."

I went off product description and reviews. If you're getting this for moisture know that it in itself is NOT a moisturizer! This is a SEALER! It has lots of oils that will SEAL moisture in your hair but that's it. There are ALOT of cheaper sealers. I use 100% virgin/unrefined organic coconut oil, or Extra virgin, organic, olive oil. This WILL NOT provide moisture. Water is not even listed in the ingredients! You can not have moisture without water. Water= moisture, oils=seal in moisture. A real moisturizer ALWAYS has WATER listed as one of the top ingredients. The people who have had success w this are probably using it after they shower, or when their hair is wet. This would work to keep the hair moisturized after applying water, but if you spray this on dry hair it will do nothing except add shine bc of the oil. That's not adding moisture."

Way too costly for the amount, let’s begin there. But it’s not a fine mist like sheen at all. Comes out in streams, which applies way too much product for your hair. It gets weighed down, and defeats the purpose of clean, flowy hair. Nice scent, but this is the reason many still use aerosol sprays.. for the evenness of application."

I love the black vanilla shampoo and conditioner, (though it does leave my hair heavy so I either use them separately or use conditioner only on the bottom of my hair). This stuff smells just like it, but I simply cannot use it. It's very oily and not the type of shine or mist I was hoping for. It makes my hair too greasy no matter how little I try to use. I've even tried spraying it on my fingers and doing it that way... yeah, no. But, it would likely be great for other hair types (mine is fine and dry). As would the shampoo & conditioner."

188,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"No Parabens, No Mineral Oil, No Artificial Colors, No Petroleum and it smells DELICIOUS!","This is one of my daughter's favorite hair products. She has 1/2 relaxed and 1/2 natural hair, as she's growing out her relaxer. Her hair was bra strap length, but as she's been growing out her relaxer our hair dresser has been cutting more and more of the relaxer out of her hair. Also, because we're not experts at this type of transition, some of her hair was falling out because we weren't taking care of it properly.Now we know how to wash, condition and brow dry it so it doesn't fall out as much.One of the requirements of natural hair is oil. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! According to the hair dresser, there is never enough oil that's too much for natural hair. We're slowly learning that she's 100% correct. We use moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, we use a heat protectant spray before blow drying and then we use a sheen to give additional moisture to her hair.She uses it in the morning after she's styled her hair and at night before she puts her bonnet on her head. You don't have to spray a lot, just a few squirts will do. It gives her hair a nice sheen and it smells delicious!The best part? No Parabens, No Mineral Oil, No Artificial Colors, No Petroleum.Honestly, I wasn't sure if the formulation of Carl's Daughter's products would change after they were bought out by a large company. I'm glad to see they're staying true to their roots (pun intended) and keeping their products as natural as can be."
189,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have waist length,  color treated, natural wavy hair.  I'm also almost 58 so I have age related thinning and brittleness to deal with too.  My hair looks great when I just let it air dry but once a  comb or brush touches it: POOF!  Frizz city!I have used various anti-frizz products but didn't really like the way they made my hair feel.  This product makes my hair feel soft, look shiny and smell great.  I love this so much I cancelled my subscription to Fekkai glossing cream. I was initially afraid that this would make my hair too greasy since my hair is in the normal to fine range and anybody with fine hair knows how ""deadly"" oil can be, laying waste to many a hair style.  Not to worry.  Now, I just spray a little of this in my hands, rub them together, then rake my fingers through my damp hair.  Once dry I can brush my hair without frizz, just shine."
190,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I decided to give this a try because I had heard Carols Daughter had some great products. I also knew CD was originally for AA hair, but the description said all hair types and I thought they might be branching out with this product. I gave it a try on my straight white girl hair and it was just too heavy, so I gave it to my biracial sister who has type 2&3 curls on her head of fine hair. She ends up straightening her hair and finds the Black Vanilla Moisture leaves her hair soft and shiny. She does not feel that it is heavy.  She said it gives enough weight to tame fly aways and keep her smooth.  It also works great when she pulls her hair back in a ponytail to work out. The fragrance is very strong (but nice) and could compete with your perfume."
191,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for maintaining curls between wash days,"I absolutely love this stuff! I have type 3B, springy curls that are more frizzy and dry than kinky. So it's always a struggle to find something that's heavy enough to moisturize my curls but light enough not to weigh them down and make them greasy. This works well for days 2 - 5. I spray it on at night, do two strong twists, put on a silk scarf and then untwist in the morning for soft, shiny curls. I have no complaints. I'm really glad they carry it at Target bow. It's more affordable and accessible than when they only carried this line at Macy's. I hope people will continue to buy it. The smell is gentle and not at all overpowering like some natural hair care products. I plan to use this on my daughter's hair when she is a little older to keep it soft and manageable."

193,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My ends are a bit fried after bleaching and dyeing, and since this says it works on all hair types, I decided to give it a try. It smells amazing, the scent isn't too strong but it does stay with you for a while. And it REALLY does give a lot of shine. Use sparingly. You might want to try spraying a little in your hand or on your fingers if you're targeting a certain area. But yes, it does indeed give a nice 'sheen' to the hair and does seem to help moisturize (not surprising considering its oil ingredients). The bottle should last a long while. Just be aware that there is a scent to it if you're sensitive and might be a trial period if you're going to be spraying it on (just try a spritz or two at first)."

Since my waves are fine, it's too much to spray this directly on my hair, so I use one spray in my palm and then smooth it over my hair.  It adds a lovely shine.I didn't realize before ordering this that it does contain silicone (in the form of cyclomethicone), so if you're following the Curly Girl Method, I'd suggest using 

Carols Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Pure Hair Oil, 4.3 Ounce

   instead.  The Pure Hair Oil has similar ingredients, but no silicone."

It smells nice, but the scent is light.  The sprayer functions well, but I do tend to spray it onto my hands and distribute that way.  A little helps a lot.  I do find it takes a while to absorb into my hair, so I typically apply it at night.  Adds shine and hydration and helps my hair look healthier."
196,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For reference, I have baby fine hair that gets oily at the scalp line and is dry on the ends and at times snaps easily. The instructions on this oil type spray, say to spray on dry hair. If I do that, it makes my hair look very oily and limp. It works much better on my fine hair if I use it while my hair is wet and then spray only 2 sprays and pick it through. The best thing about this spray is the pleasant and sweet almond and vanilla scent. I would not recommend this for very fine hair like mine, it isn't bad but, I think this would work better on coarser and much drier hair."

I had not tried it before so I jumped at the chance to give it a try. This spray was a little more greasy than I expected. I have fine hair, so it is easy to weigh down. I realized I needed to use less. It doesn’t take much so use sparingly. It does give an shine to the hair and has a nice smell."

It helps keep it from drying out as I use a blow dryer and flat iron daily. It also makes a good texturizer. This formula is less greasy and it sprays a fine mist over large sections. I use it sometimes before I use the flatiron or after I'm done I will use it if my hair seems dry. My hair gets soft and shiny but doesn't look oily. This can be used on any type of hair.

I tried it on my husbands hair, he's 3C and it made him look glossy :) also, the next morning, it was still moisturized. Kind of on the greasy side, but maybe I sprayed too much.I have 4 C hair so of course the effects will be different. It more so kept it moisturized than shiny.

Otherwise, this didn't moisturize my hair at all.  I have thick, curly, dry hair.  It left my already dry hair even drier and feeling like straw.  Also, it made it really hard to comb through when wet...almost like I put powder in my hair.  Anyway, I will continue to use it, but only lightly as a hair fragrance."

Was looking for a oil to moisturize my scalp and locs.  I used this product for 3 days and it broke my scalp out.  It smells great but it is very greasy and it caused my scalp to become very irritated and itchy.  I think I had a allergic reaction to the oil.  I stopped using it and my scalp had patches of dry skin and scabs.  I’ve never had my scalp itch so bad.  You can see how red and irritated my scalp was and this was after 3 days of using oil.

I've been using organic oils on my hair for the last year and a half bc I live in Spain and the water over here really is hard for your hair and scalp. I noticed a few months after when moved that I was starting to get dandruff, itchy scalp, and brittle hair. I was freaking out thinking I had head lice one week bc I couldn't itching. My husband was laughing at me of course so I decided to try different shampoos and oil treatments to help. I actually found this product while visiting my mom on vacation 4 months ago at Wal-Mart in cultural hair aisle. I grab it up while my mom was saying it wouldn't work on my hair. Needless to say a week after I bought it it worked wonders for my scalp.  At first I used it once a week for 10 min then I changed it up to twice a week for 30 .....still my scalp was getting flaky so I started reading online about adding heat to scalp for oil treatments for an hour once or twice a week. So now that I'm back in Spain I actually have to use this 2x weekly for an hour with heat and I use need oil hair mask once in between these two treatments. This vanilla hair oil is the only oil that actually gives my hair volume everything else I've tried makes my hair so oily I have to wear it up. The need oil treatments helps balance with the brittle issue locking in the moisture better and relieves my itchy scalp. Hope this helps you guys  and remember when traveling to different countries make sure to carry extra hair treatments....the water isn't like USA."

I wish I could just bathe in it because it smells so good.Edit 6/3/2020 - the formula has changed. The photo on the listing was changed to ""softening hair oil"" but I received ""replenishing hair oil"" which is still different from my previous bottle which reads ""pure hair oil."" I'm not sure why the packaging label differs so much but it's obvious they have been tweaking the formula. I noticed that looking at the ingredients several things have been added that are not updated here. According to curls bot, ingredients are still CG friendly.My hair likes this formula better. I am a 2b/2c wavy that had to really be careful with the old formula to prevent weighing down. I still use a tiny pea size dot but it seems to feel lighter on my hair, and is easier to distribute. My hair feels even softer than before and very moisturized. Many thanks to this brand!"

She has fine, small curls that sometimes break into waves. Lots of damage from heat tools and chemical processes, especially bleaching and lightening. She first put on damp hair, and was worried that it was too greasy. But as the day progressed, she loved how hydrated, shiny, and manageable her hair was. Her main issue with this oil is that it makes her hair flat and feels heavy. However, it’s not thick like honey, more like between olive and grape seed oil. She’s not crazy about the smell as she loves fresh, flowery scents - but I’m loving it. It’s more on the spicy and woody side. Decent amount of product for the price."

It smells heavenly, it moisturizes my thick, 4c hair and gives it a gorgeous shine. I love it because it doesn't leave my hair smelling like hair grease. I think they changed the formula some, because the scent seems a lot stronger- which I prefer. Its very good for seperating twists, bantu knots, or braid-outs. It does sit on your hair, keepong the moisture locked in."

I am obsessed.,"This product smells so good. I love this brand’s line of black vanilla products. Words cannot describe how good these products smell. Seriously.A little bit of this oil goes a long way. It is not to thick so it can be used everyday or as needed.If your on the fence, I would say go ahead and buy it. It’s hard to find hair products that smell like vanilla.Btw the product came full and in tact in the mail. The picture is after I have used the product for awhile."

It absorbs wonderfully, isn't too heavy, gives them a gorgeous shine, and is never greasy. I usually break out from oils used in my hair, but I haven't had any breakouts when using this product. I absolutely love the smell. I use it on my scalp as well as on the locs themselves. My locs are past my bottom, and one bottle lasts a month even when sharing with my husband. Highly recommend you give it a try!"

Great product!,"First i have to say read the directions! It says to apply to hair and let it sit for a few minutes then rinse and shampoo/condition and wash your hair. All the bad reviews are from people just putting it in their hair and leaving it throughout the day. It is meant to be used as a pre-wash!This product absolutely smells amazing!! Im obsessed with vanilla, the smell is really concentrated so from the bottle smells a little candle-like but after you put it in your hair it is pure blisss! And definately adds softness over-time."

About the same price, so pulled the trigger.  I  love this stuff so much - I mix it with conditioner (any kind) for my hair, and I use it all over my body in the shower after I rinse cleanser but right before I shave.  I put it everywhere, even places I don't shave, but I don't need a separate shave gel/lotion.  Rinsing off will still leave a bit on your skin which for me is excellent especially in the winter.  It also is amazing to put on right before I self-tan.  Just a little, not too much, and it almost acts like a primer for my tanning mousse or spray with bronzer."

The scent is gorgeous and I rub the excess oil into my hands and even dab a bit on my neck. It gives my natural curly hair a lift and it looks so healthy. This will now replace the mousse I've used for years.

It smells like the vanilla perfume I got at Claire's when I was 7. It's also quite greasy, and not very moisturizing. It's very disappointing to say the least, because with all the good reviews I expected much better. Will not be buying this line again, nor any of their oils.

Embracing my curls have been a journey, one that has brought a variety of products into my life and daily routine. I loosely follow the curly girl method, and am always happy to find cg approved products to try and was really excited to try this brand as it is new to me. I use this oil two ways. The first is as a weekly oil treatment, the steam of the shower makes the scent stronger and really nice. The second way I use it is off label, I put a small amount in my hand, warm it with my palms and use it to break the gel cast on my hair once my hair is fully dry post shower. I enjoy the vanilla scent and the way it lingers in my hair without competing with the other scents I use. Both ways I use this oil help keep my hair hydrated and my curls soft and ridiculously shiny without weighing my hair down or giving it an oil feel or look. Not every new product I try stays in my routine but this one definitely will be as I'm extremely happy with the results."

Just FYI in case you're migraine prone)The first ingredient is corn oil, but corn oil is not ideal for hot oil treatments.The best thing for hot oil treatments is coconut oil. In fact, if you are looking for oils for your hair, and can work with coconut, that's one of the most nourishing things you can use. The challenge with coconut is that it's hard/solid at room temperature (coagulates), so you need to keep it slightly warm, or if it's cold, use it like a wax/balm.For me, my hair gets frizzy along with conditioners, so I add a few drops of essential oils to my shampoo, then massage a few drops into my scalp after my hair is dry. It feels great, makes my scalp and hair look healthy with a nice sheen, and reduces dandruff significantly. It also helps hide grays.That's how I use this vanilla oil - a few drops in my shampoo. But it appears to be 95-99% vegetable oils, which might cosmetically add a shine to your hair, and maybe a little softness and a few nourishing vitamins, but it's not going to do a whole lot. I typically prefer essential oils.The smell is very strong, but fewer than approx 2 drops per application doesn't seem to bother me. Even if you're not migraine prone, I could never imagine using an ounce or two for a hot oil, it's very smelly.If you're looking for nourishing oils, there are a lot of inexpensive options (you only need a few drops): Try coconut oil, Argan oil of Morocco, or Almond oil, all of which can be used straight. For scalp stimulation and hair growth try a few drops of Cedarwood oil (should be mixed with a carrier, like 50/50 Almond oil, and also it's been called a masculine smell, it's going to smell woodsy and a bit musky). Or Chamomile oil will help repair damaged skin (also mix with carrier oil, and it's a subtle flowery smell)."

Smell is to die for!,I FREAKING LOVE THIS OIL! I stopped being a fan of Carol's Daughter many moons ago. She sold her company off and it just was no longer for African American hair. I ordered from that company when they were a little place in Brooklyn and all her items had to be kept refrigerated so I was there at the beginning. But then one time I used a product and it turned my hair into straw. So I stayed away from all of her items. BUT somehow in my all my natural hair product junkie tendencies I decided to give this one a try. This smells SO FREAKING AMAZING! And I love the oil mixture. It doesn't have soybean oil or some other odd mixture. I am HERE for the ingredients. Anytime I place this in my hair it's like people are much closer talking to me just to get a whiff of this scent. I smell it so I know others do as well. The smell isn't overpowering and I just enjoy it. And I am a product junkie and have laid my hands on many products but I have to say this top's it in hair oils.

Use the amount stated in the directions on the bottle because they are there for a reason. LOL  I, too, thought I knew better and had to rewash my hair to get some of the oil out because it looked greasy instead of styled.Carols Daughter also helped my split ends as well as the fly away hairs at my temple due to my wearing glasses.All in all, a great styling product that I recommend for extremely dry and frizzy hair.  Fine hair might not work as well.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine"

Judging by what they say, they are using this as a LEAVE IN hair oil! This product isn't meant to be used that way. It is a pre-shampoo treatment that can be used on its own or as a hot oil treatment. You're meant to put this in your hair just before you shampoo it out, or leave it in overnight. But it's not meant to be a styling product! If you have dry, brittle hair, rub this into your hair and scalp and let it sit for at least 30 minutes to an hour, then shampoo it out. It's amazing and will leave your hair soft and healthy!"

I tried Carols Daughter Black Vanilla (love that name) Hair Oil and used it like I do other hair oils. (I do not have a favorite brand in hair oil.) I add a very small amount to gently coat the roots of my hair and leave it on overnight. I do this about once, no more than twice, a week. The next day, shampooing the oil out of my hair is a snap and no residual. I've used the Carols Daughter's brand a few times and, it leaves my hair shiny and manageable.The Black Vanilla, though I love the name, and it has an appealing aroma, it is a bit strong for me. In fact, one night I had a little trouble falling asleep because the smell was so strong in my hair! Other than that, this is good stuff made with all-natural ingredients! If you are looking for a hair oil that will leave your hair shiny and soft, I would recommend Carols Daughter brand."

Massage into scalp and hair; shampoo.One day, my hair seemed particularly dry, so I put two drops into the palms of my hands and applied to my hair without shampooing.

Intoxicating. That's where the good news ends. I found it to leave my hair feeling heavy, oily and crispy. As in, the dryness wasn't mitigated by this oil as it is with others I use, which make it seem normal and healthy when I apply them.I will say that I'm not sure what to think about the ingredients. On the one hand, it's nice that they're simple and relatively natural. On the other hand, corn oil is thick and heavy, and I struggle to feel really taken care of by paying $80 quart for it, even if it does smell really, really nice. I thought about it, and if I loved that way my hair responded to it, I'd be more than happy to do it. But, since it fails that test, it's just high priced, exotic-smelling salad oil, to me. Can't recommend it."

She has gone on for years not moisturizing her natural locks.  She does not chemically treat her hair, she wears her hair natural.  There are a variety of oils for moisturizing, but she loves the smell of this.  I am Caucasian and use this as a hot oil treatment.  I take a small amount and transfer it to a small bottle bottle, cap it, put it in hot water, put the oil on my hair - a little dab will do ya - and wait about three minutes and rinse out.  I have fine wavy hair. I think it makes a fine hot oil treatment, maybe a little too heavy for my hair.  My step daughter really likes it, and we have gone through two bottles in a very short amount of time."

Just a tiny bit goes a long way towards adding shine and manageability to my locks. The scent is very pleasing, but doesn't overwhelm at all due to the small amount of product applied. My hair stays soft and easy to brush when I use this hair oil, I no longer have the need to use typical after shampoo hair conditioners. There is no greasy or waxy build up in my hair when using this oil either, it washes clean with shampoo while still leaving a lasting effect of soft, manageable hair.

I have short, silvery hair (that sounds better than gray) and it does seem to condition my hair in addition to the shine.  Gray hair has a tendency to lose its shine so I've been using different kinds of products to bring the shine back.  I use only a small drop and that's plenty which tells me these 4.3 oz. will last a long time.  That makes the cost only $2.21 an ounce....can hardly buy anything at that price.This does seem to me to do everything the company says  it will and it doesn't contain those ingredients we are told is so bad for us.  I don't even know what all of those named are so I guess I shall keep on living without them.  This product is worth your time and money so you can see for yourself what it does for your specific hair problems/needs.

This is my third time washing my hair with this product and feels so good and no breakage.  My only regret is that I haven't been using these products before.  Excellent,!!

It has the same lovely vanilla fragrance that I love in the other products in this line.I apply a liberal amount in my palms and rub them together then I apply it from my roots to my ends. I only wish it wasn't so expensive. I also wish that the bottle was larger.

0,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Wreaked of cheap almond perfume,"Ok, judging by the amount of positive reviews I wonder if there was something wrong with the product I received.It went on well and did an ok job of conditioning. Definitely not a deep conditioner though.What was brutally off about it was the smell.I read other reviews talking about it smelling like almond cookies. This smelt like cheap almond-ish perfume. Cheap perfumes give me the worst headaches, so did this.I thought it would dissipate after a thorough rise. Not even close, my hair wreaked. I’ve never had this happen with another product. I had to cancel plans, it was the worst smell. It took an entire day and a second rinse to go away."
1,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!! It works!!!,THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!! My hair is super dry and damaged. It was bleached 4 times within 2 weeks and was dyed twice. It totally destroyed my hair and made it extremely dry. I used this stuff ONCE (I did an overnight treatment) and it made my hair SUPER soft! It already looks and feels so much better and it smells so AMAZING!! It’s super great quality for the price and I will continue to use this stuff. I’ve tried tons of different hair masks and nothing I’ve used compares to this stuff
2,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved my hair!,"I have 3a curls. Before using this mask my hair was literally falling out in huge clumps in the shower, my drain was constantly clogged and my hair was always knotted. Within 3 uses (spread out over a week) the giant clumps stopped coming out and hair loss declined. After a couple weeks my hair looked shiny and felt soft. Now, I've been using it for months and shedding is a thing of the past. I can't believe I used to put up with so much dead hair!  Plus, it smells really nice, like almond extract. I can't recommend this stuff enough."
3,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible Product,"I wanted to find something for my curly hair and came across this brand. The scent is okay. But to call it a hair mask is a joke. I had to use heaps of it and it still didn't provide any moisture for my hair. I've tried almost the entire line of Carol's Daughter products (I bought it all at one time) and with each product, whether for skin and body, I've been sorely disappointed- especially for the price point. Shea Moisture is by far the superior brand. I even introduced several friends to it and they all ditched their Carol's Daughter products. Plus, Shea Moisture is black owned and provided relief to small businesses during covid. If you want luscious, soft, hydrated hair, I'd definitely recommend Shea Moisture. Stay far away from this brand."
4,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair has life now.,"Ever since I purchased this cream, it has made my hair more manageable and I get a lot of compliments. Let me explain my hair was bad when I tell you bad, my hair was breaking and falling a lot due to health reasons. I use this once a week, and keep it on my hair over night. I stated using this in the beginning of 2020 and my hair was not growing, looked dry and brittle. Ever since using this mask my hair feels amazing. I’m not just saying this so you can purchase it but it works for me. I won’t be trying any other cream for a while."
5,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Soothes and smooths dry hair,"I've used this product for about 2 months now.  I have dyed hair and it has heat damage from every day blow drying and styling.  My hair is also coarse near my temples where I am getting gray (boo!).  This stuff has really helped!  I use this every time I wash my hair.  I shampoo, then leave this product in while I do the rest of my shower, then rinse out.  I have not used it yet as a hair mask.  My hair is so much smoother and silkier.  It doesn't look dry and damaged like it did before.  A little bit goes a long way.  I've had it two months and I've barely made a dent in the container, although I do have chin-length hair, so longer hair will use more.  I think it smells really good!  This is definitely a keeper!"
6,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Good Especially for the Cost,"The Almond milk line from Carols Daughter is one of my favorites. The scent is very pleasant and the cream is very moisturizing. My curls are super soft after application. My only recommendation when you are conditioning is to make sure you allow the conditioner to stay on for 20 min instead of the bottles 5-10 directions to allow your to fully absorb the cream. What I love most about the line is that it is super inexpensive, especially during these troubling times. Great Buy!"
7,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,worked amazing on twice bleached straight hair,"I decided to bleach my hair twice in one day and of course my hair was parched! I looked around for a nice deep conditioning hair mask and I found this product. I had read a review from someone with straight hair and they said it worked well for them, so I decided to try it out. I also enjoyed that this company is a black owned business.I was having a really difficult time getting my hair to retain moisture but this product did the trick. I used it two days in a row initially, and now I use it every week or two and my hair is in great condition. I have no split ends and my hair is still shiny. I see some people who use this as an overnight mask. I leave it in until it starts getting a little dry and then simple wash it off in the shower. The smell is a little much when you use it first. However, once youwash it off it leaves a light baby powder smell!"
8,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great products,Scent is strong yes but leaves my hair so soft I can detangle my 3b—4b hair type just with mask alone. It’s my favorite. Giving 4 stars cause package came damaged and had to salvage as much as I could and transfer to another jar since lid was broken prob from tossing it around jeez maybe some tape or bubble wrap dear sender.
9,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but Not as impressed as I hoped I would be.","I like this product, but I don't love it like I thought I would. Sorry, Carol's Daughter. I was really hoping to love it, but lately the products I've tried have been less than what my experience was initially. I fear that the products are going downhill slightly. Still pretty good, but the price point may not warrant continuing with it since I've used other less expensive products that I love more. I may give a little more time and I'll revise my review if I feel differently after several more uses."
10,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the smell.,"I am a hairstylist who  during quarantine and needed a deep conditioning treatment and all the supply stores were closed. I settled on this. Smells great, very soft. Naturally curly fine but lots of it hair and it really moisturizes my curls. If I would be wearing my hair straight I would definitely not use days leading up to blow out.The smell of this lasts for a couple of days.I also use a drop on my dogs on bath day, they smell so good!"
11,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This,I just used this product for the first time today. I originally bought it for the scent because I love the smell of the spray leave in conditioner but oh my goodness I was immediately impressed with the slip and how it made my curls juicy and bouncy. waiting for it to go on sale again so I can stock up on it!!!
12,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great affordable product!,"I was searching for a new haircare line after using IGK and not being able to keep up on the cost of their products for the time being and stumbled upon this line, I have straight-colored blonde hair and this makes my hair look amazing! I will use this mask in my hair dry and leave it for a while to bring my hair back to life."
13,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Liquid gold,I was having the hardest time finding products that work for my sons hair (he has 4c hair) but this stuff is amazing. After the 2nd wash I could see his curls get looser and bouncier. I don’t follow the instructions. I leave it on 30 min before shower then rinse off co-wash or leave it in as a leave in conditioner. Scent isn’t so great but for the outcome it’s worth it.
14,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've stopped using relaxers, and as a consequence, my natural hair is a bear. It's hard to manage, but Almond Milk Ultra-Nourishing Mask has made the task easier. I wash my hair daily with the shampoo, spray with conditioner, and finish it off with the nourishing mask. My hair combs easily. No longer, is it an all out fight. My hair smells great, and it's soft. Highly recommend."
15,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My holy grail!,I will never wash my 4c hair without Almond Milk. It makes combing and detangling after a wash 100 times easier. Its Light scent and moisturizing properties make it essential to my every shampoo. I highly recommend this product especially if you have 4c hair.
16,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This stopped my hair from breaking off!,"I mix about 2 tablespoons of this mask with an avocado, molasses, and castor oil and I deep condition with the mixture overnight.  As a result, my hair stopped excessively shedding and my hair became soft and tangle free. The smell is intensely strong but I wash it out and add sweet smelling leave-in conditioners so the smell is not an issue for me."
17,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for 4c hair,This makes product makes my hair soft and not brittle and dry like my 4c hair usually is. The smell is just the icing on the cake and i will definitelykeep using this product
18,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money!!,"I tried this product hoping for a moisturizing deep conditioner but it did nothing. First, it smelled like chemicals or play-doh. After I rinsed it out my hair, my hair felt drier than it did after I had applied my regular conditioner and wasn’t any softer either. Extremely disappointing and not at all worth it."
19,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good co-wash for fine, 3b curls","I do a variety of things to keep my curls on course, co-wash, brush only in the shower, leave in conditioner and gel, buff at night...  This product is now firmly in the rotation, as my usual wash.  I use it on my curls several times a week.  It keeps them hydrated without weighing them down, and helps get that brush through in the shower.If only it came in an unscented version!  The scent isn't terrible, I just prefer to wear other scents, and I'd rather be able to have neutral scented hair."
20,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome moisturizer/conditioner,I have curly hair. I’ve fought the curls for years. I finally love my curls and I’ve had many compliments from strangers. I use this as a “leave in” conditioner  on my wet hair. It keeps my hair frizz free a very soft. I just ordered another jar even though mine is full. I don’t want to run out! I highly recommend this almond moisturizer!
21,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great intense conditioner with amazing scent,I love this conditioner I have fairly long hair that I do color regularly and I’m 55 years old so it needs heavy conditioning. My sixTeen-year-old daughter uses it also .her hair is extremely thick and needs the help of a good conditioner to be able to come/brush through it .the scent is wonderful!
22,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Gross Aroma,"Smells awful and the scent stays on your hair for days after rinsing it out.  It smells like a perfume my great grandmother would've worn, and if it weren't SO strong it wouldn't be so bad. It does moisturize really well--I'm just not sure I can deal with the scent."
23,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Brings my hair and scalp back to life,"I've finally found what works for my low porosity 4c hair 💗 I use this product along with tgin butter cream daily moisturizer, olive oil, & coconut oil and it works wonders I'd highly recommend signed RR=real review"
24,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy hair,"This product is amazing. I followed the directions - applied it to freshly washed hair with a little extra for the ends, and deviated a bit at that point because I got distracted. I left it on for 40 minutes before rinsing it out. My hair feels soft and healthy, and since I can’t get a haircut right now, I’m very happy to say that even applies to the ends"
25,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Effective,I have previously used the Black Vanilla Smoothie hair mask in this product line.  I have found this formula to leave my hair softer without being weighed down.  While the scent is nice (reminds me of the original scent of Jergens lotion ) I would prefer the scent to be less present after my hair is dry and styled.  Will continue to use.
26,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THIS!,"LOVE THIS !!!!!!! It has been the best treatment for my hair.

29,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works For Me,I have Rosa Diaz season 1 curly hair and this works great.

30,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not silicones be free,"This worked very well the first couple times, but then I read the ingredients and found that it contains phenyl trimethicone, a solicit that causes build up."
31,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for all multiple racial hair types.,the product feels very watery compared to the herbal essential products that I used all my life so far.

32,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great results, horrible smell","This product really moisturized my hair and left it feeling so soft but I absolutely despise the smell.

36,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Give it a try if your hair is dry 😁,I bought this years ago but didn't follow the instructions.  I purchased this deep conditioner followed the instructions and i love it makes my hair so soft and manageable.

40,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing!,"Love the almond scent, not too overpowering  and actually smells like an almond dessert! My hair is pretty soft afterwards, but may be too moisturizing as I end up having to wash my hair more often than usual."
41,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a LONG way on damp hair.,I wet my hair and use this as a leave-in Conditioner ..sometimes a Co-wash. The product is VERY moisturizing and makes my curls last longer in this heat. It's cheaper on here than the site so that's another plus. The almond scent is strong if your nose is sensitive. Just add water to your hair to tone it down. No big.
42,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Has Silicones,"Has silicone in it. I bought it because product description said no silicones.

120,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's ok,"It's fine what what is meant to do, but there are better products on the market."
121,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dry hair is hard to style. It breaks and sheds, and looks dull and frayed. It looks unhealthy, and can overshadow the healthy vibe you have going on elsewhere on your face – your skin, smile, teeth.My kids are old enough to call the shots on their hair, and they like wearing it natural. The smooth-n-hold pudding my son was using gave his afro volume, but left flakes in his hair. Additionally, over time, it matted and clumped in a way that wasn’t easy to pick out. Usually, when his hair reaches this point of no return, he reluctantly gets his hair cut.Carol’s Almond Milk Ultra-Nourishing Mask has a much lighter texture – almost watery, so be careful when opening the jar. A palm-sized dollop provides sufficient coverage for a full-sized teen afro. My daughter, who wears her corkscrew hair long, uses two dollops for crown-to-ends coverage. After shampooing or wetting the hair, rub the palms together, and work the mask into the hair – especially the ends. Wearing a  shower cap for five minutes allows the product to soak in and smooth out the dry parts before rinsing out.My kids love it. The almond smell isn’t apparent after being washed out. It’s a non greasy, non oily and light texture that really revitalizes dry hair. The wide-mouth jar design is a little unwieldy in the shower, and it would be nice to have this available in a pump-action container. Otherwise, a great product for natural hair."
122,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"First of all, this smells like the old time Jergans almond lotion my grandmother used to use. I love that smell and it makes me happy. Second, this mask is NOT for fine thinner hair.This comes in a jar filled with creamy almond smelling 'yumminess'. (Hey, if bigley is a word so is yumminess) The directions tell you that after you clean your hair, you apply this and let it sit. I left it long enough to finish my shower business. Wash it out and style. It's absolutely leaves your hair soft and for us over processed people that's wonderful. The sad part is, thin and fine hair will be weighed down really quickly. Even when adding product to help with volume, it's still too​ much.Enter my super thick curly headed children. I've always been at a loss because my children have my husband's thick curly locks. Not having that, everyday I learn how to deal with it. We go through gallons of detangler on a regular basis just trying to keep their hair from frizzing out and knotting up. I mean, these children have BIG hair. (Of course I would love to have it!) After washing their hair in the tub I applied this to the back 10"" or so and let it sit while they played. (I make them stand up to rinse as I don't want them sitting in this for extended periods of time. It may be fine but I'm over cautious) Their hair is not processed at all, just hard to manage. I have to admit, it's not bad on them. It does help keep the softness of their curls and def helps the brush out, even the next day. I still have to use some detangler but it is a little more well kempt.This isn't for me but surprisingly I've found a great use for it. After reading more about this company's products I will def try another more well suited product for myself."
123,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great fragrance and makes hair smooth and soft.,"I have thick long hair that's naturally brown, but was dyed blond for several years and then dyed back brown again. And now also dyed every six weeks to cover the grays that are popping up. Light or normal conditioners don't do much for me. I have to use deep conditioners to keep my hair soft, as well as prevent it from looking crispy since I also have to flat iron it to tame the thickness.Some hair masks and deep conditioners I've used don't absorb into my hair as well as it seems they should. They may be thick, but some seem to just sit on top of my hair rather than really feel like they are soaking in. This hair mask does get really into my hair. It feels like it's melting into it rather than staying thick on top of it.And the smell is wonderful. If you like the smell of almond milk, you'll love this because this fragrance of this hair mask is not at all subtle. It's a sweet scent that fills the shower and then lingers just a touch after you've rinsed your hair out.I've been using this every few days for about two weeks and it's kept my hair smooth and shiny, and very manageable."
124,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used a few Carol's Daughter products and so far this line is the best scented one.  Their products tend to be on the strong perfume'y side, which is great if you're going for that but I chose these because they sound a lot more natural than most and don't have things like parabens which means they allow my color to last longer.  That leaves me torn on this product.  It, combined with the shampoo from the same line, leave my hair feeling amazing -- something that is hard to pull off when you abuse your hair.  The scent isn't something I can tolerate regularly so I rotate my shampoo with the shampoo from this line, then as an occasional treat for my hair I use this with the shampoo from the same line.  For people not as sensitive to smells as I am, this would be a 5 star product.  For me it's a little less but still better than their Mirabelle Plum collection, which I really have a hard time tolerating the scent of."
125,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well on colored hair,"My daughter has recently been all about having her hair dipped. Which means, as she has brown hair, bleach first. In an attempt to help keep her hair from just snapping off due to the bleachy crispiness, we have been using this on the ends. It has been working quite well! It smells lovely, and is not too thick and gloppy. A small amount, worked in, is all that is needed - so this has been lasting quite a while. Even better, for our particular situation, it does not seem to be affecting the color in any capacity. So overall, this is a good option for those who want something that doesn't strip color, doesn't have all those nasty parabens and stuff, and smells delicious :)"
126,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My hair is very dry and chemically treated and has been for 15 years. I have tried many different conditioners. Most of them do not work on my hair.So far, I found 2 other conditioners that really make a difference with my hair and one is a Korean beauty product that I can no longer buy.Carols Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Hair Mask is, thankfully, another product that actually works on my hair. If I don't feel like letting this sit on my hair and rinsing I can just put this on after washing and leave it in. I just use a smaller amount. My hair is so soft after, I can't believe it's my hair.And the fragrance of this product is fantastic, I really love it. It's a light fragrance; I want it as a perfume!"
127,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Even works on fine, thin hair without weighing it down","Despite the ""homespun"" brand image, L'Oreal owns Carol's Daughter--- the formula is a standard hair mask/deep conditioner with softening qualities and standard industry ingredients; not so different than a hair conditioning mask from Biolage or Redken (also owned by L'oreal).It left my fine, frizzy, flyaway hair soft and fluffy without added weight or greasiness. It did not impart shine, and still did not fully tame frizz; i had to use a silicone serum to fix that. The softening qualities are great -- the smoothing/defrizzing? meh.Almond Milk, however, is very highly fragranced. Those with a sensitive nose may want to reconsider."
128,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This product smells wonderful (almondy sweetness) and makes my hair very soft, smooth and shiny after I use it as directed (i.e. Massage and leave in clean wet hair for 5-10 minutes, then rinse). However, by the end of the night it feels like my hair is like too heavy and not necessarily oily, but clingy to my head. I have very fine straight hair, so perhaps with this hair type it is a bit much if used as directed. I read another review that suggested using it just like a normal rinse right out conditioner for this hair type, so I will try that. I can imagine that this conditioner, when used as directed, may be better for curly or frizzy hair, to tame it down and make it softer and shinier."
129,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Deep Conditioning Mask Delivers Defined, Soft Curls","Deep Conditioning Mask Delivers Defined, Soft CurlsThis deep conditioning mask nourishes my dry, damaged hair more than just using the Almond Milk shampoo.  The pleasant fragrance is so dreamy and relaxing that I've included it in my Spa-Di-Dah pampering routine. This mask IS wonderful to use weekly or twice a month depending on your hair needs, but is a little TOO much for daily use even on my dry, dyed hair.Hair buddies have been raving about this product for over 6 months. Carol's Daughter brand products are available for VARIOUS hair needs. The trick is finding what will work for your hair and lifestyle. This is definitely worth a try for dry or damaged hair!"
130,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Strong fragrance which is wonderful for some and not so much for others,"I have wanted to try this hair brand for some time so was pleased to see it offered for a Vine choice.  I have shoulder length, color processed hair that is dry on the ends and that's where I wanted to put this product.I wish the jar was sealed for a couple of reasons.  One being that as I opened it I tilted the jar and almost lost the contents as I took the lid off. The other being I just feel better with a sealed bottle or jar, knowing that it was not tampered with, especially in a retail store.I am sensitive to fragrances and to me this smelled more powdery than of Almond Milk. I tried using it, but I just couldn't because of the strong fragrance."
131,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Large tub of emollient cream for the hair,"There is no seal on this large tub of very emollient cream for thick and full hair.  The scent is appealing and I'm tempted to use it as a skin cream i the shower because it is just too much for my own hair.  My daughter, on the other hand, with thick, long hair, is better suited to benefit from the formula.  The labeling is as simple as I like it, with no frills to distract from what's inside the tub.  I'm in favor of supporting small businesses, particularly women owned businesses, however this is not a product I would reorder or recommend.  Perhaps I would think differently had there been a seal on this tub to assure that there was no contamination."
132,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My hair is fine, straight and flyaway, and I am always looking for ways to counterbalance the damage done by blow-drying while helping it maintain volume. This has not ever been an easy task and is even less so as time goes on. This product makes my hair very soft and manageable if I apply it and rinse it right out as I would a regular conditioner, but if I leave it on my hair for the recommended amount of time, it weighs it down way too much. By the next day. my hair looks like it's plastered to my head. Since I do not like to shampoo daily, that was not going to work for me. So basically, I like what this product does but only if I do not use it according to directions.I'm super sensitive to smells which can also make me super critical of them. While I normally love the smell of almond-scented soaps and such, I find this scent is less almond and more powder-y, and reminds of the type of scents my grandmothers used to wear. Not much of the scent lingers on my hair after it dries which is too bad. I like to use hair products that make people say, ""Your hair smells SO good.""This product has all of the ingredients it says in the product description, but it has a lot more unpronounceable ones - almost twice as many chemically-sounding ingredients as the similar product I use (Fekkai's PrX Reparatives). I don't know if that is good or bad, because I'm not a chemist, but only mentioning it because I was surprised when I saw how long the list was. You can see the list in the magnified picture at the top of the product listing page.Bottom line: This product does what it says it does, it is just a bit too heavy for my fine hair to handle when used as directed. I really like how my hair turns out when I use it more like a quickly rinsed-out conditioner, so I will definitely give the Conditioner version of this product a try."
133,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For generations, people from South Asia have put almond oil in their hair. People from Greece and Italy use olive oil. People from the Middle East use argan oil. Others use coconut oil.This is basically the moisturizing power of those oils, but in an expensive cream.You put it in your hair, leave it for 15 minutes, and then wash out (like with The Australian Three Minute Miracle).This product certainly works, it smells nice, and is well packaged. If you have money to burn, buy this. If not, just buy a bottle of almond oil, apply a handful, leave on overnight, and then shampoo out. The benefits are the same.Five stars."
134,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Almond joy! Born in Brooklyn and made in the USA,"I’m having one of those hair moments lately where my hair feels dry and unmanageable even when I’m in the shower shampooing it. I’m noticing a weird trend in the shampoos I’ve been trying lately where no matter how long I rinse, I just can’t rinse all of the product out of my hair (including expensive Fekkai shampoos) and so I can’t add conditioner or my hair will be heavy and dull. Anyway, I decided to go buy a $1.99 Suave product at CVS and do a double wash like the old days to get rid of shampoo residue, which did the trick, and then try this conditioning mask over my stripped hair.Oh my goodness. It’s a miracle! My hair feels clean and light again. It was easy to manage with a comb, easy to dry and style with a flat iron, and most of all, it smelled amazing. Almond is one of my favorite fragrances for beauty products (along with lavender).This is a pretty hefty jar of product and because it’s not super thick, it’s easy to distribute and you only need about a tablespoon of it. Because my hair isn’t heavy and laden with shampoo residue now, I also don’t have to wash it every day. I can skip a day or two as my hairdresser insists I do (it took some getting used to but hair quality improves when you aren’t constantly stripping it as I have found it necessary to do recently). As for the claims of reversing damage, nourishing and protecting, I can say it definitely nourishes and protects. It improves condition as well but as for reversing damage, I’m not 100% sure that’s actually possible. My hair does look pretty amazing, though.Paraben and petroleum free AND made in the USA. I would definitely buy this product."
135,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best,This has to be the best deep conditioner I’ve purchased thus far.  I’ve been natural for about 5 years and just now finding products that works best for me.  I have Low porosity hair and this keeps my hair moisturized and very soft.  I definitely recommend and will be the only deep conditioner I will use from now on.
136,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the scent of this conditioner! The almond smell reminds me of the old Vidal Sassoon shampoo. But it's actually more than just almonds; there's also a hint of baby powder. Whatever it is, it's a combination that appeals to me, and it's different than the usual floral scents.This conditioner makes my super-thick, curly hair very soft. I only apply it to the bottom half of my hair, as I tend to have an oily scalp and don't need conditioner on my whole head. I would guess that it might be too much if you have thin, fine hair, though."
137,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Tames my frizzy wavy hair,"This leave in treatment works great. It does what I was hoping and expecting. I have long, thick, and frizzy wavy hair and have been looking for a good conditioning product without a bunch of harsh chemicals. The smell very gentle and not perfumey. Upon even the first use it left my dull hair very soft and shiny- it helped with the frizz.I do prefer this to have come in a squeeze or pump bottle versus jar as if I'm in the shower- it's hard opening and using this without getting water in the jar."
138,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Almond Milk Ultra-Nourishing Hair Mask,"I have naturally thick, curly hair and Carols Daughter Almond Milk Ultra-Nourishing Hair Mask is wonderful for moisturizing it. I use this as a leave in conditioner and it works great. It reverses hair damage like it promises, it smooths out my hair nicely and leaves it soft and the curls defined.It also smells so good and no parabens or silicones!I'll be trying out more of Carols Daughter hair products."
139,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Secret of Soft and Shiny hair,"I fell in love with this product the first time I used it. It smells delicious works wonders. My hair feel very soft and shiny. It is safe for color treated hair.I use it as a conditioner cause I do not have time to wash and style my hair every day, plus I don't like to use way too many products in my hair. I just shampoo my hair and keep the mask on for about 7-8 minutes and then rinse it off.I'll definitely recommend the product, from the price point of view also it us reasonable."
140,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Give It Time, It Works","At first, this product seemed to do nothing for my curly kinky hair, but after giving it several more tries (b/c i refused to give up on it due to the price)over the course of several weeks, I noticed my curls were softer, stayed moisturized longer, and my hair looks better overall. I'd say if u want to use this product, give it some time and then, hopefully, you will start to see good results like I did."
141,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not my fav,"I used this with 15 min of heat for deep condition. I was expecting for my hair to be soft and have some slip when rinsing out. I feel like my hair was slightly stripped, prior to using I used a hydrating shampoo which made my hair feel clean and soft. I had to use Aussie moisture conditioner to soften hair right after."

143,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My hair is fine and fragile. I often use hair conditioners targeted to ethnic hair, because they have that extra moisture my dry hair needs.This thick paste mask is perfect for any hair that needs deep conditioning. It left my hair softer without feeling too oily afterwards. The scent is light and hair just smells clean.Not a miracle product but very good."
144,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I love this stuff. I like how smooth my hair is for sure but I also like that k wear it to the beach or a park on a hot Sunday and it bakes conditioner in.  Just used it in the shower this morning - my hair looks and feels healthier.  I'm going to go do my damage by flat-ironing it to death....and can tell already it will do nicely, will report back my findings!"
145,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended for processed hair!,"This is a great product.  My hair suffers quite a bit of damage on a regular basis and was starting to look frizzy and frazzled unless it was completely coated in styling products.  After just a few uses, my hair is already looking far healthier.  The scent is not overpowering and my hair does not feel greasy after a treatment."

The moisture stayed nicely in my hair all week until my next cowash.  I'm not sure how it will work during the summer but for now this will be my go to deep conditioning treatment.
147,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my hair soft,"This hair mask works pretty well. I put it on and leave it on for a few minutes and then rinse. After a few uses, there was a noticeable softness in my hair. The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the smell is a bit on the strong side. It can get on my nerves a little bit. But that's the only negative I have to say."
148,"Carol's Daughter Almond Milk Ultra Nourishing Mask, 12 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Keeper,"Left my hair soft and my curls defined. Very moisturizing product. The consistency isn't too thick, but thick enough to feel like it's penetrating your hair. It smells delicious -- almost like cookies, haha.  I love that you can use it as a regular and deep conditioner. Only thing is, the product is much cheaper in Target. I got mine there on sale for $10.80; regular price is $12. I say give it a try!Oh, if it helps, my hair is a mixture of 3c/4a!"

But it wasn't long before the change in climate/water/food made my hair start falling out and breaking off like crazy. Just came back to the US and am trying desperately to correct the damage.  Using this hair mask and their leave-in monoi oil spray has helped my hair tremendously. It has helped stop the heavy fallout and breakage and really softens my stands without that slick, oily feel. And their products have a light, pleasant scents - not heavy perfume smells so this is a 10 for me."
1,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best out there for me!,"I probably use this more than I should, but it makes my hair so soft and it smells better than anything else I've ever tried (drug store, salon, or online bought). I use about twice a week, and keep in my hair for 10-15 minutes after showering, then rinse off, making sure it's completely off the top of my head but leaving a bit on the ends of my hair for added softness. My husband doesn't mind my hair in his face (well not really, but he will sniff my hair :)) at night because it smells sooo good. I don't even bother with any lotions or perfumes after showering, especially at bed time, because of the great scent (which doesn't go away!). I've been using this product on, off, then on again, for the last 3 years. On when I color my hair. Off when my hair is natural, but I do use the shampoo and conditioner by Carol's Daughter. I am a middle easterner with regular to thin hair thickness but can frizz, straight with some waves."

I don’t like the price but it works for my curly hair. It’s worth the money but I won’t be using it on the regular. 1 jar is usually good for one application because my hair is so think. I use it about every two months.  The sent is like a strong rose or flower smell or something close to it and will sometimes trigger my allergies.

I've used bedhead, chi, matrix, garnier fructis, pantene, ouidad, biolage - none deliver like this product.  My hair is colored and highlight, and I blow dry straight every week.  But I haven't used a flat-iron since September, I feel, because of this hair mask. Scent is awesome. Product is rich but not oily.  After shampoo I towel dry, apply from ends to root, and wrap in a shower cap or just put in a clip for 30 min - 1 hour.  My hair soaks it up like a sponge - NOT LIKE OTHER conditioning masks / balms that forms almost like a helmet of dried product.  After rinsing, I let hair air-dry a while and then blow out.  Hair is more responsive and styles quicker because it's healthier and ""behaves"". I use a heat protector and a touch of pure organic argan oil when blowing out.  The first picture is right after blow drying.  That night I put my hair in a bun and wrapped my head.  The next day I had soft natural big curls that held all day to Houston humidity.  Even the second day my hair still had a nice wave.  I am very happy with this product."

This strengthens your hair and gives it shine. I still need a leave in conditioner to moisturize my hair after using this conditioner. It is not the case with other products like deva curl. This is not an issue but I have 4A/4B hair that does not like too much product so I sometimes skip leave ins. However, I give this 5 stars for its hair strengthening , shine and scent powers. I use this once or twice a month or right before getting a protective style. Very good product for weak and fragile hair."

Within one use, I noticed a big difference in manageability and have recommended this to all of my friends all of whom have different hair types and also now love this product.Background: I have belly length virgin hair and am too lazy to do anything with it--including blow drying during freezing temperatures. My hair gets cut twice a year so healthy hair is imperative to my low-maintenance routine. This product has been a game-changer in the condition of my hair in between haircuts as well as for repair after more damaging processes. Although I mostly don't touch my hair, I sometimes I have to do crazy things to it for shoots and shows and the monoi oil somehow makes it healthy again. I will say that because I have fine hair, a Sephora representative had me try the Bambu deep conditioner and recommended this product to my best friend who has an afro. While I saw his point that this product is heavier, I found the previous product to be too light for any damage."

I used a lot of heat on my hair daily. I am biracial (white and black) and have naturally curly 3b hair. It’s fine but I have a lot of it. My hair is also color treated. This stuff worked like magic. I left it on my hair overnight and then rinsed out in the morning. It left my hair smelling soooooo yummy and very smooth and not frizzy! Now I used it in place of my regular conditioner. I love it!

It is a bit pricey (and the reason why I sometimes buy cheaper ""equivalents"" instead), but I have frequently come back after realizing that it's worth the extra money. It makes my hair feel healthier. I have course, thick, curly hair. This makes my hair shinier, healthier. It brings life to my hair and not only reduces breakage but helps with split ends that I do have. It is so much easier to detangle my hair after I use this product, especially after using it 2-3 times. I usually come back to this product when my hair becomes severely dry and unmanageable and after only 2-3 uses my hair is back to looking healthier."

I know swear by it and use religiously once a week.  Since I've been using it, I only have to trim my hair every once in a while.  I'm trying to grow my hair out so I'm avoiding getting too frequent hair cuts.  I also highlight my hair and straighten it about 3 times a week.  Before I used this, I'd get split ends and frizziness. This hair mas also helps calm frizz down.  I highly recommend this hair mask."

I loved the shine it provided and it help minimize my breakage.  When we ran out of the product, my stylist advised that she wasn't that impressed so we did not purchase a replacement.  Well, my spoiled hair reacted violently.  Within 2 weeks my shine was gone and my hair started shedding again.  My stylist and I tried multiple remedies, not thinking of the Monoi, to no avail.  After a month, I purchased the Monoi through Amazon and gave it to my stylist who insisted this was not the remedy.  Ha!!  It was!!!  Immediately upon the 1st reuse of CD Monoi Repairing Mask, my shine returned and breakage once again minimized.  Stock up Amazon, I will not go without this product again."

This is a must for hair that tends to run dry and frizzy or is chemically processed or color treated.  I have no more breakage or split ends.  Last time I went for a hair cut she said she didn't even need to take anything off the length it was so healthy.  That was a first and I know it was due to this deep conditioning treatment.

My hair dresser remarked on how good my hair smelled and it was day after I had used this product.

I just recently started highlighting my hair again and we know what damage that can do to our hair. I ordered it this time on amazon and I still love this stuff. I just recently got my hair done and the ends were dry and my hair wasn't as nice as before. I put this in for a couple hours even though it says only a couple minutes.

22,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great smell and feel, but lacks real potency","I ordered this product to try over holidays and on the whole was satisfied with the product's smell and texture which makes it ideal for detangling hair and as a deep conditioner after shampooing. In this review I want to make sure I mention that I've had limited exposure to Carol's Daughter hair products in the past so I wasn't sure if you would have different results when using the entire the product line for the Monoi products.That being said, I speak from the perspective of someone who used a Paul Mitchell's Awampuhi Shampoo typically before using this deep conditioning mask. I cannot stress how amazing this product smells. It's like a light floral and almost nutty scent that lasts hours after you've used it (I got many compliments from friends). The biggest issue for me is that after using this product, while it gave me a slight shine to my hair. It let my hair super dry and coarse. This may be a hair type problem I have curly type 4a hair. I found after using the product I had to layer on multiple layers of conditioner to get the silky smooth look and feel I wanted. I am continuing to use this product if only to make the up front financial investment ($26) worth it. I would advise against purchasing this item independently of the product line that may make a difference in how your hair responds to this hair mask. I would also recommend using it less than once a month as while it does pack a keratin-punch for hair, you wouldn't want to use it to often and get a hard straw like feel. I will say I did notice a small decline in hair breakage/shedding the next time I detangled/washed my hair."
23,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,MUST buy!,"3rd time re-ordering. A must use if you have hair like mine - thick, long, curly, and frizzy. Completely wilds out after the beach, hot weather, or a night out. Nothing works quite as good as this, not even other more expensive hair mask, and the only thing that makes my hair as smooth as the Monoi Mask is an oil treatment - which I have to leave on for hours and is heaps messier! I take about 2-3 months to use a jar, but that's because I use it so often."

Moisture!,I'm in love.  I colored my hair about a month in half ago.  Since then I my hair has been ultimately dry & brittle.  Tried several deep conditioners &/or masks.  This is the one!!! As I applied I saw a difference. I went under dryer for approximately 20 mins. As I styled my hair I notice less shedding of my hair.  The day after I still saw moisture in my hair.  This is definitely will be added to my hair regimen AND to my top 5 hair products!!!!

I have fine long blonde hair and I color or do the roots about every 3 mos. I was having a huge slow down in growth, as well, I was shedding big time. If my fine hair had a snag or tangle, forget it - a chunk of like 20 strands would come out. Haven't seen that since using monoi! Also, there is literally no hair on my comb after using now. I have been using this for 4 months. It's an easy to use system. Also, I discovered it from my mother in law who uses it, and she is black with straightened/permed hair so I'm pretty sure this works well for everyone, as the two of us have completely different hair types but we both love the CD Monoi products!"

I think it's hard to have naturally curly hair that is moisturized, healthy and shiny and this product goes a long way in helping make that happen. It's really simple to make a part of your regular routine too. I just put it on in the shower, throw on a shower cap, shave my legs and do my normal washing then take off the shower cap and rinse. You don't have to sit under a dryer for an hour for this product to do it's magic. It also smells great. I would recommend this to anyone with curly or dry hair. Also it's completely worth the money. Even with twice a week use and shoulder length hair I buy it about every two to three months."

My hair is past my shoulders now and this product has allowed it to grow by helping to minimize the breakage.

The label says that you have 96% less breakage after one use and it's true!  I have fine, highlighted hair and it keeps the highlights well conditioned but doesn't weigh my hair down.  I have also purchased the monoi shampoo and love it as well.  This is the only conditioner I will use.  I highly recommend it for anyone!"

124,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best conditioner ever used,"I'm an African-American woman with thick, natural 4b hair that hits around mid-back length when it is flat ironed.  The Monoi Hair Mask is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used on my natural hair.  After I wash my hair with As I Am Coconut Cowash I apply Monoi and leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse out.  My hair is a bed of well defined, super soft curls that can be easily combed out or finger combed.  If I'm doing my hair at home, I simply finger comb my hair (which, thanks to Monoi only takes a couple of minutes), apply a generous amount of SheaMoisture Curl & Define Milk and let it air dry.  My curls are defined, soft, and last until I am ready to wash them again.  If I am getting my hair professionally done, I take Monoi to the salon with me to use for my deep conditioning treatment.  My stylist loves it.  And because Monoi conditions so well, I experience significantly less hair breakage during the comb out process.  Carol's Daughter products are either a hit or severe miss for me, but the Monoi Hair Mask is definitely a hit.  I HIGHLY recommend this product for natural, Afro-textured hair.  The downside is the price.  For the price I think customers should be granted a bigger jar.  I get about 6-8 applications per jar; that said I apply the product very liberally, so others may be able to get a few more applications out of it than I do."
125,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite Carol's daughter product to date!,"I received this from a monthly natural hair subscription and I was really happy about that cause I wanted to try it since Moknowshair recommended this as an elasticizer. I have kinky, wavy, curly hair that sometimes experiences some droopiness so I like to add a really good protein treatment here and there.The good:Smell. This has a really light floral scent that I didn't mind. It wasn't too much of anything and it did not linger in my hairConsistency. This has a nice thick, creamy texture that is super rich and moist feeling. It went into my hair like a dream and absorbed really well. What I mean is that it melted into my hair with no problems which let me know that it was working.Slip: OMG, this has SOOO much slip! I had absolutely no problems detangling my hair after having it in a wash n go for a week. I did not detangle or moisturize for that entire week prior to application. (I have to make a note that I use a oil to pre-poo and I did not attempt to detangle until after I had sat for 20 minutes with this in my hair under a hooded dryer. I don't detangle until I let my conditioner do its job.)The bad:Not much, but I have to say that I was not impressed with the effectiveness at ""repairing,"" maybe because its a mask and not a deep treatment. I have used other treatments before that I can see the difference right away. This was not the case with this product.Overall: Despite not seeing results right away I would use this product again. It is not at the top of my list, but it is by far my favorite Carol's daughter product to date!"
126,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I feel slightly bad at lowering by one star, but here is why... the product works great, but the scent really is strong for the rest of the day, and I LOVE the scent of gardenia, but it was a bit overwhelming for me, and I'm not highly sensitive to scent.So, this is EASY to use, and for me, a little goes a long way.  I really concentrate this on the ends of my hair.  I wash and condition like normal, and about once a week I put this on the bottom few inches of my hair and take an extra long shower.I really have noticed an improvement in my hair, which becomes brittle in summer (playing in the pool with the kids and being out in the sun dry my hair) and winter (dry, cold air) months.  I've noticed less breakage and fewer split ends.  My hair is also not as frizzy.  I have naturally wavy/curly hair, and I have to be careful styling it in the morning or I get frizz, then I have to be careful getting caught in the wind or rain as that too will trigger frizz.  I do think this helps reduce frizz on those days when frizz is just not avoidable, which I love."
127,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Provides major moisture to dry hair,"I have fine textured blond/gray hair (not really sure how much is gray since I have it colored and highlighted) that has been getting dryer as I get older. It's nice because my bangs aren't greasy and plastered to my forehead by noon on hot days after being shampooed in the morning. But it also means that my hair is more subject to breakage and it's been getting a little thinner over the years. This is a very nice product because it adds a lot of moisture to my hair. I use it at night when I'm going to wash my hair in the morning. I take a small amount (it doesn't take much) on my fingers and rub it between my hands and then through my hair. A lot could be used, or a little, depending on how much conditioning I want. Then I go to bed and wash it out in the morning.Even with my hair pretty well coated, it took only a lather of my shampoo and then a repeat to remove it. I used a Suave brand shampoo. I was afraid it would leave behind oil and weigh down my hair, but it didn't. It seemed to absorb into my hair at night and wash out in the morning. My hair looks soft and styles easily with just a warm blow dryer. (I know, blow drying can damage hair, but it looks totally blah if I just let it air dry. I need the lift of the blow dryer.)This will be a good treatment to use a couple times per week for me. Adding a very small amount to dry hair would probably make it more manageable if I had coarser or thicker hair. The only downside I can see to this product is the rather strong Gardenia fragrance. I like a small amount of the fragrance but this is pretty intense. I would buy the product in an unscented version or perhaps a different scent (lemon? herbal?) if it were available. If not, I will probably buy this scent because I like the feel of the product and the way it performs."
128,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For me this is a very pleasant smelling, softening, detangling, protien fortifying, and breakage preventing mask conditioner for the hair. I haven't use the shampoo, or the regular conditioner yet that goes with this brand. I am used to paying around this amount for a higher end grocery store available product, so I might just do that and update this review.  I styled my hair right after the shampoo and conditioning. The shampoo i used is a medium priced product like this one. It is also a sulfate free product as the shampoo corresponding with this brand is. The styling went very well, and I actually got a compliment on my hair; though, I am not sure why since I didn't do anything to my hair but maybe muss it up a little bit with a blow dryer, which separates my waves a bit, and it makes them stand out more. I have very fine, and particularly fragile waves. My hair almost gets curly in the back, yet in front  I have a haircut that compensates for the lack of curl pattern. Yet my hair was very wavy when I used the product. Today, i used regular conditioner,  and my hair is so soft. My hair is relatively healthy, yet of course when it is fragile as it is, it is a concern to strengthen it. The fragrance, the ingredients, the results, all desirable for me. I will continue to use this brand for a while to see how I like it  as a set. It isn't necessarily a big deal for me to have a shampoo that works the best possible. What is a concern for me is how the conditioner works. So I could use an inexpensive shampoo really, and get similar results. I just want to try this line just the same. Worth noting, though, that if you put the lid directly underneath the jar, it will disappear into a space. I've had to fish it out with onlin Worth noting, though, that if you put the lid directly underneath the jar, it will disappear into a space. I've had to fish it out with knife.

129,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Second time's a charm,"Has a really nice smell, and a little goes a long way.  I have very thick 2c hair (wavy and coarse), color treated, often straightened, and several inches past my shoulders.  This hair mask is thick and easy to apply with no drips.  I used about 1/3 the amount I would use of regular conditioner.  it is easy to rinse out and did not leave a greasy feel or residue.  The first time I tried it I got out of the shower and waited about 10 minutes before returning to the shower and rinsing.  I was disappointed to notice little or no change in my frizzy, somewhat dry hair.  However, the second time I used it I just stayed in the shower and left it on for five minutes or so.  This time my hair was noticeably softer and less frizzy, requiring substantially less leave-in hair product than usual, even into the second and third days between shampoos.  Normally the second day after shampooing I have to apply a little more leave-in conditioner and flat iron some of the frizzies away, but I was able to brush my hair and just dampen/scrunch it slightly and wear it wavy again.  I really like this conditioner now and will continue to use it once or twice a week to keep my hair softer and  more manageable."
130,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have really damaged hair.  It has been bleached and colored and spent the summer in the pool.  My hairdresser said I would have to cut at least 3 inches off to get rid of all of the damage.  It has split ends and is breaking a lot.  Oh and I let a trainee stylist use a curling iron on my which further fried it as well as my scalp.  I have straight fine hair so the damage is really noticeable.I am not going to claim this is a miracle but after two uses (one per week) leaving it in my hair overnight, I have reduced the breakage and split ends.  It is still in bad shape but I think that it has really helped save my hair.  This does not leave my hair feeling greasy or cause it to be flat.  It is much more manageable My hairdresser was really impressed with the results.  I use a voluminizing shampoo and conditioner after using this overnight.  I couldn't find any directions for blonde hair so I am just guessing with how I have used other hair repair masks.  I think it is really made a difference in fixing the damage."

Unforntuely, the top had broken and seal had broken too during shipping, so when I got it, it was a gooy mess. I only marked down by 1 star for that reason, but still used the product and absolutely love it!! See my pictures.It's so funny, I thought I ordered skin cream and put it on my skin and loved it, LOL! Then realized it was hair cream so I washed my hair and let this sit on my hair for about 10 minutes...wow!!! My hair is normally very dry and broken ends, but this made my hair so lovely and smooth and soft. The scent is very intreging to me. It has a woodsie, yet feminine scent. I little bit perfumey, but lovely. I tend to like natural scents, or mens fragrances and this is wonderful!! I absolutely love it and use it as skin cream too. It you have oily hair, you probably won't like it, but with my dry hair and skin, I love it!!! My new favorite!!!"

The repairing hair mask is amazing and leaves my hair soft, healthy and smelling wonderfully. I put this on about once a week or every other week depending on how much I wash my hair (definitely more often in the summer because of how dry my hair gets from the beach water and pool chlorine). I leave it on after I shampoo for about 10-15 minutes and voila, my hair feels amazing! I definitely recommend this product for anyone struggling with dry hair!"

If you like gardenia, which I love. I have shoulder length hair that is pretty damaged from bleaching and dyeing. I'm half Asian with naturally very dark brown hair. I had it blonde for a while and now it's red, so that's a lot of processing. And I blow dry my hair after I wash it as well as using a flat iron to style it. I usually towel dry my hair and then apply this, wrap my hair up into a bun and secure with a clip and leave it in for about 20 minutes. Then I just rinse my hair under the faucet in the bathtub. It does keep my hair feeling pretty soft, but I honestly haven't noticed a difference in the way it looks. The thing I love love love about this is that the amazing smell lasts and lasts and lasts. I don't wash my hair often (about twice a week), and the gardenia smell is still there until the next wash. Overall, it's not a miracle product but I really like it a lot for the way it makes my hair feel and smell."

I have used it twice and my hair is noticeably softer, shinier and tangle free. I wash my hair as usual and towel dry it. Then  I massage the hair mask into my hair from roots to ends and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before rinsing it off. It also has a great, light floral scent that I enjoy.My only quibble about this hair mask is the packaging. The plastic tub feels cheap and flimsy. The lid seems pretty fragile as well. For the price and the performance, I would expect a little more solid and luxurious packaging.Overall, the hair mask is awesome and does what it says. It makes my hair silky, soft and manageable. I love the results I got from using it just twice so far. It is a little expensive but well worth it."

But based on the feedback from other reviewers in the past it sure seems expensive. Anyways, This does work reasonably well for conditioning your hair. It does render your hair soft and manageable. The smell is floral strong but pleasant. The minor quibble I have is the container! it does tend to be messy as the top lid sticks with the plastic seal. Overall I think this is okay product.

The effects are not as good as we had hoped, but it's still much better than many similar products that we've tried.

It gets such good reviews from others, and with the high price point, I kept thinking I was just not getting it, and that if I were to keep trying I'd find some that I love. Usually I love the perfume and hate the frizz it leaves (as in the case of a conditioning oil, a shampoo, and a conditioner); with this one, I hate the perfume (smells too strong, and sort of like 1970s Avon to me) and find that the mask has no particular conditioning properties. Too much money, and doesn't work for my Caucasian loose curly hair."

I have been using this product for the past 12 weeks (A little went a long way for me, I was able to stretch out 2oz over that entire time) along with Josie Maran Argan Oil and I am happy to say that while my hair is growing out past my shoulders it is not dry and I do not have nearly as many split ends as I usually do.  This stuff also smells AMAZING. I recommend it and I intend to buy more of this stuff for myself!"

I deep conditioned with carol's daughter monoi repairing mask for 30 minutes under a heating cap. Once my hair was dry it was crispy and hard.

It smells so good.My hair is very dry. I'm a blonde and I color my hair. I've also inherited dry brittle hair from my mom...I've used so many products and none seem to help. Than this came along!My hair looks great after one application.  So soft and shiny. I am so beyond happy.  I have long hair but I didnt have to use a whole lot. Work it on your wet hair real good and get the ends...I will get several treatments in this one jar. Also, if you look up pure Monoi oil, it's not cheap. Dont be fooled by oils mixed with coconut oil... the ingredients in this are high end and well worth the money!"
160,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Deep Conditioner!,"After regretting my spontaneous idea to perm my hair (haven’t done that in decades!!) my hair was completely fried. It felt like straw- none of my normal conditioners or serums were helping at all.I was desperate to find a deep conditioner to repair the dry brittle hair that resulted from the unfortunate outcome of the “beach wave” perm.This conditioner is like BUTTER. It’s thick, and a little goes a long way.Because my hair was so damaged, I first used it on my hair overnight.Now that the perm damage is long gone, I still use it once or twice a week depending on the “Florida Humidity” level. I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs an occasional deep conditioner or like me, had some serious hair damage.It’s not a conditioner you use every day, so don’t let the small-ish container fool you. It will last at least a month for medium length hair if used one or two times a week."

But the wonderful smell seduced me!  I am very pleased with the thick texture, and fantastic conditioning results I received as well.  My hair is 3b-c curly, I am Caucasian with a small amount of African heritage, so my hair is dry, frizzy/curly and fragile.

From the marketing, it looks like this product is meant for African-American hair. However, I'm white with completely straight, very fine hair (the exact opposite of typical African-American hair), so don't be scared away if you don't have curly or thick hair. This product works wonders for those of us with chronically dry hair. I've never been able to grow my hair past about 2"" below my shoulders because the ends just break off no matter what I do. But these products have changed that and my hair is now down below my shoulder blades. For the first time in my life I'm going to have to ask my stylist to take off some length!"

My hair was really dry and damaged due to the high heat and hard water. This was GREAT. I couldn't use it everyday because it was too heavy for my thin hair but once a week worked perfectly. Smells amazing too.

My hair is so soft after using this product.  omg I love this scent so much that I put a lil bit in my hair  in between shampoos.  This is a must have!  Would have given 5 stars but there are NO directions with this product. And white print on label blends right into gold label so it's difficult to read.  Maker's should consider a dark print maybe chocolate brown :o) for ease on eyes and legibility factor.  Come on Carol's Daughter, you gotta start putting instructions for use on your containers!!!  PLZUPDATE:  Found instructions/directions on BOTTOM of the container... honestly no one looks on bottom to find directions but they are pretty legible and easy to understand so gave 4 stars.  However still don't like the white print that blends into gold label on sides and back of container.  So if you are new to Carol's daughter products, look on the BOTTOM of the container/jar/bottle.  Have fun! ;o)"

There is no instruction on the product i.e. how long to leave it on your hair before you wash it out and how many times a week you should use it. I kept it on for about 10 minutes. It sure did make my hair smooth.

251,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best detangler mask less breakage of hair,"I love this product . I literally can wash my hair and finger detangle with using this mask. When i do take my detangle brush i have less hair in my brushm The longer you leave in your hair will love you!. I have coil 4c hair . Ive never had a product were a little on your roots to your ends; detangles to slip the coil nappy hair into silky  slip. It glides through. Ive used a lot of products in the past, nothing works like this mask.  I just wished the jar was bigger is my only complaint.  I also leave in some of the product and blow dry straight. My boyfriend  loved smelling  my hair. He said it was a rich smell."
252,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely Strengthens,"This mask is really intense. Did I notice less breakage after one use as the product claims? Yes I did, considerably! I'm sure with further use over time the effects are even greater. I have used the Monoi mask 2 different ways, following the directions on the product. I've used it for about 5 minutes, and I have also used it for 15 minutes with a cap, under a warm hooded dryer for an even deeper treatment. The only problem with the latter is it makes my hair very rough and hard upon rinsing, and I have quite a time restoring the softness. However, when I used it only for a few minutes, my hair feels pretty soft after rinsing. I do prefer deep conditioning so that's a bummer. This is the type of treatment I would use once a month or every other month for a really deep treatment, and to keep my hair strong. It smells like fresh flowers which is a pleasant and tolerable scent, but I am not a fan of it ( I do not like the smell of fresh flowers, I do not like them Sam I am). If you're thinking it smells like coconut, it does not. Overall, this is something that I will continue to use every now and again so it doesn't have to be perfect, it only has to be strengthening, as the product claims, and those claims seem to be pretty well supported given the instant results. I did not use the matching shampoo and the product claims 98% less breakage when used with the Monoi Shampoo.  I have medium textured, chemically treated hair."

I usually use drug-store shampoos, and conditioners; however, I have been using the Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, usually once or twice a week, for over a month. I can honestly say that I really like it!Each time I open the container, I am greeted by the most lovely, white floral scent (which I love). It may be a little on the strong side (especially for men), but if you like white floral scents, you will probably really enjoy it.To use this, I use two fingers to scoop out a little bit, rub that into the palms of my hands, and then smooth it over my head as I work it in to my hair. I leave it in my hair while I finish my shower routine (probably 5 mins. or so), and then rinse it out really well.I have thick, wavy hair, and this hair mask leaves my hair soft, tangle free, really helps to tame my usual frizz/flyaways, and makes my hair smell amazing for the entire day. (As a bonus, I find that just having this on my hands to smooth it on my hair, makes my hands noticeably softer!)Even at the price point that this sells for, I will most definitely repurchase this, when I run out."

I was even shocked that my brushes had less accumulation of hair on them.Monoi translates to ""sacred"" and this for sure has been a sacred repairing hair mask for me.  It smells heavenly and leaves my hair soft and silky smooth.  I plan on trying the entire line of Carol's Daughter Monoi products."

The scent is tantalizing and it really works to deep condition. She used the entire tub over the course of a month and happily extolled its virtues far and wide. She is not typically a fan of floral scents and this one is strong but she indicated she loved how her hair smelled all day with it. If you are scent sensitive you might want to pass - this one packs a wallop!  It had a fair amount of slip for a deep conditioner and washed out easily. No brittle or dryness encountered (can happen with products with too much protein in them)."

I have used MANY deep conditioning packs, including: Macadamia Oil Pack, Aussie 911, Wen Deep Conditoning, Moroccan Oil Deep Conditioner. NONE of them ever have come close to this stuff!

This product is amazing! If your reading reviews and wondering whether or not you should give it a shot, go for it:) The product is a little on the expensive at $32 when purchased in store, but I do know if you but it in stores or from the Ulta website you get a free Monoi shampoo and conditioner with the mask. All the products in this line work perfectly together so I would recommend purchasing it from an Ulta retailer. I'm Hispanic and have thick, medium-length dark hair. About a year ago I had a traumatic experience with a bad dye job and this product brought my hair back to life! Also, helps restore moisture if you use heat styling tools often. Must have, must keep :) Try it out!"
266,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Deeply Repairing Hair Mask with Monoi Oil Made From Tahitian Tiare Gardenia Flowers and Coprah Coconut Oil and No Parabens, 7 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I Really Wanted To Like This Conditioning Mask... :-(,"First let me say that I have relaxed/color treated hair.  This mask was recommended to me by a store rep along with the Black Vanilla conditioner for dry scalp & breakage issues.  The Black Vanilla conditioner was awesome!!!  This Monoi, not so much.  I used it after my wash for the first time today & sat under the dryer for a few minutes.  But after the rinse, my hair was SOOOO TANGLED!!!  The comb was barely going through my wet hair.  I tried using another conditioner/detangler, rinsing my hair some more & it was still tangled!  The sound of the comb going through my hair was so crisp & dry.  It was awful!!  I will be returning this in hopes of getting a refund.  I don't plan on using it again & it costs wayyyyy to much to just let it sit around.  I'll probably consider sticking with the Black Vanilla line & replace this Monoi mask with the Black Vanilla Smoothie as a deep conditioner.UPDATE: After drying my hair in rollers, it came out shiny & bouncy. However, my hair is VERY dry especially my scalp.  It just looks & feels dry/crispy.  Also, I was experiencing some INTENSE scalp itching.  I couldn't wait until it was time to get my hair done again to get some relief.  This may be a good product, possibly for a different hair texture like natural hair.  But it just wasn't good for me."

This item is on my ""must have"" list!I am African-American with tightly curled, un-permed (natural) hair.  Previously, after washing my hair, my hair would curl and tangle so tightly that it would take hours to comb. And, hair breakage was horrible.This product is a game changer.

This makes my hair easily detangle, smells like gardenia flowers. It is a tan color with a creamy, buttery texture. It doesn't exactly make hair shine, but is great for a leave in conditioner and makes hair even curlier. I liked the price for the amount that you get of 7oz. It doesn't weigh hair down and is not oily. This is perfect for any ethnic hair type or wavy/curly hair for non-ethnic hair. When I put it on my hair I instantly noticed the difference. I love this and plan to buy it for as long as they make the product."

I had little breakage which is GREAT for me...and NO KNOTS!! For those who said their hair was hard; this product has protein which hardens the hair as it dries. The deep conditioning process does not need heat for it to be effective. Just apply, wait, rinse, and enjoy!"

In my hair arsenal for sure. Following chemo, my kinky hair came back baby fine.  I was pretty scared my hair would snap from braiding or combing.

I am caucasian with bleachy blonde hair that is very dry & damaged. I was hoping that this project would help mend it, and in fact, I was kind of concerned that this product would actually be ""overkill."" I was disappointed. My hair was no more silky or detangled than when I've used cheaper deep conditioners from lines such as Garnier Fructis or Loreal's sulfate-free line.  I have no problem spending money on a good deep conditioner, and that's what I was looking for.  Maybe this product works better on other hair types, but I wanted to write this review for anyone with MY hair type who might be considering it: it just didn't work.On a positive note: the fragrance of this product is very, very strong when it is in the container, but it does not over-perfume your hair."

The products have been amazing for my damaged hair from heat, perms, coloring, and stress. My hair began seeing a change with the Monoi line but I still had a problem with some minute breakage at the ends.  I had tried Intense Repair Inner Strength System six months ago. But I did not see a rapid improvement as I did with the other Carol's Daughter Monoi products. So about two weeks ago, I was low on one of my Monoi products and decided to give this one more try. I am so glad that I did, the transformation was incredible. My hair literally grew one inch in two weeks time. Whereas my hair had only grown three inches from June to December when I first started using this line. I agree with others who have commented on this product that it does take some time to see results. However, you should see beautiful, luxurious, and healthy hair results if you are patient. This line and this specific product is great. My hair is being restored to the way it was when I was a child; thick, long, and beautiful."

2,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Intense Repair Inner Strength System with Monoi Oil and Taurine for Stronger Strands Reparative Treatment, 8.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I tend to have thin, frizzy, bleach blonde hair, and I need extremely moisturizing products especially due to the bleach. This smells really good, and it's a very thick product. At first I didn't think it was effective, then I realized I needed to clarify my hair with a shampoo. I use so many different products at times especially ones with oils, and I really need to use a clarifying shampoo at least once every two weeks. Once I did that, I could really feel how amazing this was. Every time I use it I leave it in for a couple of minutes and also use a wide tooth comb in the shower to comb it as well. My hair feels so much better with this, and when I rinse it off it still feels as soft as when I had it on. My hair soaked this right up, and is super happy with it. I've been using this almost twice a week, and basically whenever I shampoo my hair since I don't do it everyday. It's really helpful on my dry scalp too, and I massage it really well into it. Overall, this is definitely a really good conditioner if you are needing intense moisture. Sometimes products like this are hard to find. I do recommend."

I’m not quite sure why. But I like this one, and over several weeks’ worth of consistent use, I do feel like it’s helping to strengthen my hair.It’s easy to apply and rinses out cleanly. It smells lovely and my hair is alway super soft after use.The thing is, though, I don’t think I would put this in the “must have” category. At least not for myself. My hair is thick, naturally curly and color-treated. I only wash it every 4-5 days. Only this year, when Covid has prevented me from getting regular trims, do I really feel like my hair has become brittle. So this product is definitely helping, but the circumstances I am using it for aren’t permanent.If you have overly processed hair, or if it’s really dry, this is probably a great option. It strengthens hair without adding weight to it, which is great, especially for curls."

If you are familiar with it, then you know exactly how luscious it smells. Monoi oil is gardenia steeped in coconut oil (Tiare Flowers -Tahitian Gardenias- and Coprah Coconut Oil). The combination makes for a supremely gorgeous aroma. When I saw this Carols Daughter Monoi Intense Repair Inner Strength System I was curious how closely (if at all) it would have of the traditional Monoi Oil scent. So although this says it contains fragrance, it totally smells like my beloved Monoi Oil. I liked it for that reason instantly.As for a conditioner, I like it too. I really like when a conditioner/conditioning treatment is formulated to be effective with minimal leave on time. This says to keep on for at least a minute. So most times it is just a minute, sometimes a little longer. I find that my hair is conditioned, but not weighed down. Not frizzy. Just looks healthy. Not so conditioned that it compromises my waves/curls. It is meant to be used once a week, and it seems to be something that over time I will noticed more benefit. So give it a few treatments. But I love that I could tell nearly instantly that my hair was better.My hair: nearly waist length, medium course, semi curly/wavy, leans dry. I wash my hair 2-3 times a week, use this once a week. I don't do much else to it. I rarely style it, I don't dye it (yet).Since it is stated to be a ""once a week"" treatment, this 8 ounce bottle will last quite a long long time."
5,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Intense Repair Inner Strength System with Monoi Oil and Taurine for Stronger Strands Reparative Treatment, 8.2 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,I got this for my daughters who are mixed and needed some good ol tlc with their hair. Since we've been home their hair has been more dry and brittle than usual and I will def say in the process of using this you can see a difference right while the product is sitting on the hair. I let the product sit a little longer on my middle daughters hair since I used it as a way to comb thru her hair and making sure the product was distributed evenly especially since her hair is a lot longer and thicker. I will say this made combing thru her hair a piece of cake and there were some tangles closer to the scalp but I was able to comb thru it all in about 15 mins using this and once I washed it out you could tell it brought back some life to her hair. I used this in conjunction to their leave in moisterizer and curl gel but I will say I seen the most inprovement in using this product and this is way more inexpensive then the products we have used in the past so this will def be something we will be using again in the future.

I have short, dark, coarse and curly hair with many white hairs interspersed throughout, and am 33 years old. I wash my hair daily, so sometimes it needs a little bit of extra moisture to repair and smooth it down a little bit. This oil feels so silky soft in my hair, leaving it soft and calm the next day, and my scalp seems to enjoy the treatment as well. I have had zero adverse reactions to this oil, and it does not cause breakouts or clogged pores. It smells like a tahitian vanilla heaven, with a touch of sweet floral essence, and is truly beautiful for the sense of smell.I really do recommended this oil to you if you need some extra moisture, your hair will thank you!"

I have fine hair and usually don't use conditioner. I recently have been having issues with hair breakage because of my hormones and began trying everything! This has helped my hair break less and leaves it super soft! It also doesn't leave it oily the next day which was a concern of mine! It is the closest thing I have found to conditioner found in a box of hair dye!
8,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Intense Repair Inner Strength System with Monoi Oil and Taurine for Stronger Strands Reparative Treatment, 8.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I was expecting it to be a bit more like a thick hair mask. It's a good consistency for a squeeze out bottle, so that's good. It's not as thick as one you might find in a jar. It still conditions well, it just doesn't stand out as being really thick and moisturizing. I'm sure it's working more over time for repair. I leave it on for several minutes before rinsing it out. When used along with others in this line, I find there to be even better results...which I'm loving this line, they're favorites 👏🏼 Both my daughter, who is mixed, and mom (white, has curls too but a different hair texture than daughter) use this and it works nice for each. Reason for leaving off a star is wishing it were a little more like a thick hair mask."

I have super thick hair that is constantly frizzy and out of control.  I have tried several shampoos, but with little luck.  This shampoo is AMAZING! It smells really good and it lathers well, but you can still feel that it is leaving some of that ever-important natural oils.  It rinses cleanly, but I didn't even need anything after this.  I usually have to use conditioner and some kind of oil to tame my mane after washing it, but I just used this, a little bit of styling cream and got amazing results.  My hair was shiny, smooth, and beautiful and stayed that way for several days!"

I received it in a simple packaging without any damages or leaking product. It contains 8.2Oz of product which is pretty good amount specially for that price. I really like the smell, it's really decent and it's not strong at all to bother you so I think it's a good choice for people who are sensitive to smell. It's very effective, you can see the result even after one time using it although the better result will appear after at least several times constantly using it. It makes my hair super soft and silky which I really like about. You need to use it after you wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner, just apply a small amount of it and massage it from root till end of your hair and leave it for couple minutes then rinse it."

Like a tropical vacation, coconutty and flowery. I shampooed my hair and towel dried it and then applied a generous amount of the mask to my hair and made sure it was evenly applied.

My hair is damaged and dry from bleaching and I try to do my best to make it healthy between bleachings. This is a great treat for my hair to help it out."

I have thick, color treated hair that can be dull, limp and frizzy nearing the time of my next color treatment.

It is a thinner cream but is easily incorporated onto your hair. It has a very nice fragrance that isn't too strong, very pleasant. I recommend giving it a try."

It makes my fine long hair so silly smooth and moisturized without the weigh down. Smells absolutely amazing, like coconut and flowers. I use it once a week and it has really helped my hair from breaking as much. Especially as my fine hair tangles very easily and needs to be brushed several times a day to keep from knotting. Overall, great product. Highly recommended."

16,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Intense Repair Inner Strength System with Monoi Oil and Taurine for Stronger Strands Reparative Treatment, 8.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,The packaging is gorgeous. The set has a great smell but not overpowering like most shampoos and conditioners which is great cause you can tell they're focused on the results of the product and not the scent. This product added hydration to my hair and its a good price for a hair treatment. The smell was a little strange and I feel like you need to use to with the shampoo and conditioner for better results. The only issue is the conditioner is hard to get out of the container cause it had a little spout. So it takes some oomph to get it out.

We all have different textures, while mine is only slightly wavy, their hair is all curly.  I've noticed a nice improvement to all of our hair.

I applied this hair mask right after shampooing and left it in my hair for about 15 minutes before rinsing it off. Before rinsing, I did use a wide tooth comb (like I always do when I condition my hair) to detangle my hair. I found that while this product seems to have slip, it was really hard to detangle my hair with it on. I eventually got it detangled and rinsed the product out of my hair. When styling, my hair felt heavier than normal and had an odd sheen to it, almost like I applied oil but it didnt feel oily. I dont know. It just felt odd while styling my hair, too, like really heavy, not really moisturized, but it smelled nice. It just didnt work for me but I'm willing to give it another try on my next wash day and hopefully have a better experience. If that happens, I'll be sure to update my review, but as of today, its not a negative nor positive experience with this product."

I have 3B curls that need so much hydration. I was shocked to see that this comes with no seal at all. No plastic seal on the outside and no paper covering under the lid seems unhygienic to me. The directions are to put this on the hair after shampooing and conditioning and leave on for 10 minutes. This product is a weird, marshmallow-like consistency that you rub between your hands to ""activate"".  It is HEAVILY scented- a mix between a floral and chemical scent- despite being labeled that it's ""good for your hair"". After 10 minutes I washed it out and could immediately tell my hair wasn't as soft as it was prior to putting this on. It felt weirdly squeaky clean (if that makes sense) and upon combing with a wide tooth comb I could tell the softness and hydration I usually have just wasn't there.  It was as if I shampooed my hair but never followed up with a conditioner at all. The perfume scent lasted until I washed my hair again, drowning out even my perfume. As a deep conditioner this was absolute crap. My hair didn't feel or look any better and actaully felt drier after using this product."

I used this after shampooing and conditioning and then left it in for at least 10 minutes before rinsing. The consistency is really thick, and it was a little difficult to spread throughout my hair. It rinsed out, but left my hair feeling a little filmy and after doing my regular hair routine, I feel like this hair mask may have dried my hair out a bit rather than hydrating it and for my personal hair, it weighed it down and my curls were not their usual self. I also was not a huge fan of the scent, which was too strong for me. Overall, this product may work better for someone else's hair, but for me it wasn't my favorite."

This mask has a thicker yet fluffy type of consistency when putting on and I do think it felt moisturized a bit when just rinsed out. However, once my hair was dried I didn't notice too much of a difference and felt I needed to add a bit of extra moisture to my hair with my typical leave in conditioner. The scent was also on the stronger side, though that doesn't stick in your hair once dried aside from a light scent which I liked.Overall, I think this is a good mask to try, though for my specific hair type I'm not sure it'll be in my typical routine."

It started to feel quite a bit more dry than usual and became frizzy.In the end, this wasn't right for my hair...but it could be perfect for you.

I have severely damaged hair and thought i would give it a try. It does make my hair softer and leaves if feeling moisturized but this is a very heavy conditioning product that might not be suitable or all hair types. The scent is not very pleasant."

And I will use it like the mask rather than the pre-conditioner.  It just makes more sense...rather than washing it out with shampoo and wasting the product, I will just use it like a conditioner because frankly I think that is what it really is and is just packaged differently? Also, this has a nice woodsy vanilla scent."

Now I actually have to read the ingredients because you never know what you'll find these last several years. This product, ostensibly designed for African American hair, has two ingredients (at least) that do harm to our hair: silicone (in the form of amodimethicone) and isopropyl alcohol. Why?Furthermore, the beneficial ingredients are located in the second half of the ingredient list. The first half is nothing but fillers and junk like fragrance. At least it smells good???I do not recommend this product for any African American hair types. It may be okay to use on a wig."

2,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Ultra Shield Pre-Shampoo Treatment, Detangler for Natural Curly Hair, Made with Castor Oil, 10.2 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an interesting product. You apply it to your hair 10 minutes before washing and it's meant to protect it from being dried/stripped by your shampoo. They encourage you to use it in combination with the Goddess shampoo/conditioner, but I used it with my usual Bleu products from R+Co. It made a difference in the softness and manageability of my hair after washing. It smells and feels nice, as well. I had hoped this product would make for easier detangling (I typically comb my conditioner through after shampooing), but I still had plenty of snags, which was a little disappointing.Overall, this seems like a good addition to my regimen...I appreciate the extra protection it offers and the improved manageability.  I just wish it would have helped make my fine, easily tangled hair a bit easier to work through and resulted in less breakage (I had the same amount of hair in the drain after washing with this as I typically have)."

So, I was eager to try Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Ultra Shield Pre-Shampoo Treatment.I did not even know that a pre-shampoo treatment would mean so much. But it did make a difference in the results of my shampooing and conditioning. All I had to do was to put this wonderfully smelling pre-wash into my dry hair and let it sit for ten minutes. Then shampoo and condition as usual. It protected my hair from drying out and becoming unmanageable.It must be the castor oil, ginger, and cumin seed that are in this hair treatment. They protect and strengthen the hair. I do know that there a many fewer hairs in my comb after a shampoo these days!There are no parabens, petrolatum, artificial colors, or mineral oil in this formula.This is made in the United States."

I normally don’t do anything in terms of preposition except apply Olaplex #2 and scrub my scalp with a scalp scrub. But this puts the icing on the cake and I’m truly amazed at how well it prepped my hair for the shampoo process. It made the hair so much softer and I could feel that in the process of putting it in. What I found to be even more impressive was the fact that I did a purifying shampoo for the first shampoo and it still didn’t dry my hair out. This stuff is amazing. The scent is a little strong but smells good and isn’t long lasting. Made a huge difference in my hair and I’ll be getting more for my kids and myself. I will never go without this for sure.

It works well - but at the same time, it's about the same as competitor products as well.  The scent has been hit or miss from us - some people have liked it, others felt it smelled too strong and artificial.  So, your mileage here is likely to vary, like ours was.Overall, we'd certainly use this product again if the price/value was right.  But it's not above the competition in a way that we wouldn't shop around a bit, either."

My hair was so soft and smooth after using this. I used it after bleaching my roots and washed it out with my Olaplex 4 shampoo and it did wonders for me. It smells a little strange (not bad but not overly pleasant either) and it washes out wasily. Leaves the hair feeling very hydrate, detangled, and shiny."

I apply this to my damaged ends and let it sit for several minutes.  Then I shampoo my scalp and let the rinse water from that wash down to my ends.

But it wasn't long before the change in climate/water/food made my hair start falling out and breaking off like crazy. Just came back to the US and am trying desperately to correct the damage.  Using this hair mask and their leave-in monoi oil spray has helped my hair tremendously. It has helped stop the heavy fallout and breakage and really softens my stands without that slick, oily feel. And their products have a light, pleasant scents - not heavy perfume smells so this is a 10 for me."
1,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best out there for me!,"I probably use this more than I should, but it makes my hair so soft and it smells better than anything else I've ever tried (drug store, salon, or online bought). I use about twice a week, and keep in my hair for 10-15 minutes after showering, then rinse off, making sure it's completely off the top of my head but leaving a bit on the ends of my hair for added softness. My husband doesn't mind my hair in his face (well not really, but he will sniff my hair :)) at night because it smells sooo good. I don't even bother with any lotions or perfumes after showering, especially at bed time, because of the great scent (which doesn't go away!). I've been using this product on, off, then on again, for the last 3 years. On when I color my hair. Off when my hair is natural, but I do use the shampoo and conditioner by Carol's Daughter. I am a middle easterner with regular to thin hair thickness but can frizz, straight with some waves."
2,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,You got the Right Stuff for the value of your money!,This stuff is on the expensive side. I don’t like the price but it works for my curly hair. It’s worth the money but I won’t be using it on the regular. 1 jar is usually good for one application because my hair is so think. I use it about every two months.  The sent is like a strong rose or flower smell or something close to it and will sometimes trigger my allergies.

I have ""mixed race"" hair, and this product delivers for me.  I've used bedhead, chi, matrix, garnier fructis, pantene, ouidad, biolage - none deliver like this product.  My hair is colored and highlight, and I blow dry straight every week.  But I haven't used a flat-iron since September, I feel, because of this hair mask. Scent is awesome. Product is rich but not oily.  After shampoo I towel dry, apply from ends to root, and wrap in a shower cap or just put in a clip for 30 min - 1 hour.  My hair soaks it up like a sponge - NOT LIKE OTHER conditioning masks / balms that forms almost like a helmet of dried product.  After rinsing, I let hair air-dry a while and then blow out.  Hair is more responsive and styles quicker because it's healthier and ""behaves"". I use a heat protector and a touch of pure organic argan oil when blowing out.  The first picture is right after blow drying.  That night I put my hair in a bun and wrapped my head.  The next day I had soft natural big curls that held all day to Houston humidity.  Even the second day my hair still had a nice wave.  I am very happy with this product."

This strengthens your hair and gives it shine. I still need a leave in conditioner to moisturize my hair after using this conditioner. It is not the case with other products like deva curl. This is not an issue but I have 4A/4B hair that does not like too much product so I sometimes skip leave ins. However, I give this 5 stars for its hair strengthening , shine and scent powers. I use this once or twice a month or right before getting a protective style. Very good product for weak and fragile hair."
5,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best hair product I have ever tried,"This is the best hair product I have ever tried. Within one use, I noticed a big difference in manageability and have recommended this to all of my friends all of whom have different hair types and also now love this product.Background: I have belly length virgin hair and am too lazy to do anything with it--including blow drying during freezing temperatures. My hair gets cut twice a year so healthy hair is imperative to my low-maintenance routine. This product has been a game-changer in the condition of my hair in between haircuts as well as for repair after more damaging processes. Although I mostly don't touch my hair, I sometimes I have to do crazy things to it for shoots and shows and the monoi oil somehow makes it healthy again. I will say that because I have fine hair, a Sephora representative had me try the Bambu deep conditioner and recommended this product to my best friend who has an afro. While I saw his point that this product is heavier, I found the previous product to be too light for any damage."

I used a lot of heat on my hair daily. I am biracial (white and black) and have naturally curly 3b hair. It’s fine but I have a lot of it. My hair is also color treated. This stuff worked like magic. I left it on my hair overnight and then rinsed out in the morning. It left my hair smelling soooooo yummy and very smooth and not frizzy! Now I used it in place of my regular conditioner. I love it!

It is a bit pricey (and the reason why I sometimes buy cheaper ""equivalents"" instead), but I have frequently come back after realizing that it's worth the extra money. It makes my hair feel healthier. I have course, thick, curly hair. This makes my hair shinier, healthier. It brings life to my hair and not only reduces breakage but helps with split ends that I do have. It is so much easier to detangle my hair after I use this product, especially after using it 2-3 times. I usually come back to this product when my hair becomes severely dry and unmanageable and after only 2-3 uses my hair is back to looking healthier."

I also highlight my hair and straighten it about 3 times a week.  Before I used this, I'd get split ends and frizziness. This hair mas also helps calm frizz down.  I highly recommend this hair mask."

I loved the shine it provided and it help minimize my breakage.  When we ran out of the product, my stylist advised that she wasn't that impressed so we did not purchase a replacement.  Well, my spoiled hair reacted violently.  Within 2 weeks my shine was gone and my hair started shedding again.  My stylist and I tried multiple remedies, not thinking of the Monoi, to no avail.  After a month, I purchased the Monoi through Amazon and gave it to my stylist who insisted this was not the remedy.  Ha!!  It was!!!  Immediately upon the 1st reuse of CD Monoi Repairing Mask, my shine returned and breakage once again minimized.  Stock up Amazon, I will not go without this product again."
12,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best deep conditioner!,I love this stuff.  I use this weekly and the results are amazing.  My hair has never been so healthy.  I will be a user for life.  This is a must for hair that tends to run dry and frizzy or is chemically processed or color treated.  I have no more breakage or split ends.  Last time I went for a hair cut she said she didn't even need to take anything off the length it was so healthy.  That was a first and I know it was due to this deep conditioning treatment.

I purchase the entire Monoi line and I still experience breakage.  I continue to use the conditioner because it smells great and leaves my washed hair feeling soft but it hasn't stopped the breakage as promised.
15,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Brings hair back to life.,I bought this at sephora a year ago when I absolutely killed my hair and this stuff was great. I just recently started highlighting my hair again and we know what damage that can do to our hair. I ordered it this time on amazon and I still love this stuff. I just recently got my hair done and the ends were dry and my hair wasn't as nice as before. I put this in for a couple hours even though it says only a couple minutes. After I washed it out my hair was so soft even when I blow dried it. Definitely going to be using this as a mask at least once a week!

22,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great smell and feel, but lacks real potency","I ordered this product to try over holidays and on the whole was satisfied with the product's smell and texture which makes it ideal for detangling hair and as a deep conditioner after shampooing. In this review I want to make sure I mention that I've had limited exposure to Carol's Daughter hair products in the past so I wasn't sure if you would have different results when using the entire the product line for the Monoi products.That being said, I speak from the perspective of someone who used a Paul Mitchell's Awampuhi Shampoo typically before using this deep conditioning mask. I cannot stress how amazing this product smells. It's like a light floral and almost nutty scent that lasts hours after you've used it (I got many compliments from friends). The biggest issue for me is that after using this product, while it gave me a slight shine to my hair. It let my hair super dry and coarse. This may be a hair type problem I have curly type 4a hair. I found after using the product I had to layer on multiple layers of conditioner to get the silky smooth look and feel I wanted. I am continuing to use this product if only to make the up front financial investment ($26) worth it. I would advise against purchasing this item independently of the product line that may make a difference in how your hair responds to this hair mask. I would also recommend using it less than once a month as while it does pack a keratin-punch for hair, you wouldn't want to use it to often and get a hard straw like feel. I will say I did notice a small decline in hair breakage/shedding the next time I detangled/washed my hair."
23,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,MUST buy!,"3rd time re-ordering. A must use if you have hair like mine - thick, long, curly, and frizzy. Completely wilds out after the beach, hot weather, or a night out. Nothing works quite as good as this, not even other more expensive hair mask, and the only thing that makes my hair as smooth as the Monoi Mask is an oil treatment - which I have to leave on for hours and is heaps messier! I take about 2-3 months to use a jar, but that's because I use it so often."
24,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,So many products make promises. This one delivers. It's crazy expensive but yep I'm buying it again because it really works. Your hair will smell great look great and be visibly improved.

Very happy with the service; I would recommend it to all my friends. This mask smells amazing, the effect on the hair is nice; and last you for at least 5 applications. However i m still experiencing some breakage. Will keep using it and see."

I use it at least once each month, and find its moisturizing and conditioning properties to be absolutely wonderful!  I will continue using it and recommend it to anyone who wants to have soft, manageable, strong and healthy feeling hair."
31,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,nothing out there compares,"As always you can't go wrong with this. This provides moisture,strength and repair yo your tresses. No matter what hair texture you have, fine,straight,wavy,kinky or textured hair.... you will love this. The smell so lovely and it lingers so long."
32,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I gotta say this is a good conditioner and smells good,I gotta say this is a good conditioner and smells good. You always have to switch it up but I feel maybe this one is decreasing the breakage a little. I have terrible hair and its a bit better lately  this is lovely and luxurious anyways
33,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super moisturizing,The ends of my hair have been bleached probably 10 times in the last year and I use this mask every time I wash my hair.  As a result the ends of my hair are silky smooth.
34,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Smell!!!,"Amazing!!!Great smell, leaves hair smooth and, well it's too soon to say it has helped with the breakage, but I'm very pleased!!!I Guess after all, KimK was right, great product."
35,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Conditioning mask,This mask made my hair softer but was so heavy it made it so flat. It’s a nice smell but kind of overpowering after awhile.
36,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Softy,"Recommended by my colorist. Definitely makes processed hair softer and more manageable, and smells divine. It is rather expensive, so try alternating with Redken's All-Soft shampoo/conditioner."
37,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture! Moisture! Moisture!,I'm in love.  I colored my hair about a month in half ago.  Since then I my hair has been ultimately dry & brittle.  Tried several deep conditioners &/or masks.  This is the one!!! As I applied I saw a difference. I went under dryer for approximately 20 mins. As I styled my hair I notice less shedding of my hair.  The day after I still saw moisture in my hair.  This is definitely will be added to my hair regimen AND to my top 5 hair products!!!!
38,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works,"I use the entire system of products and my hair is in great condition. I have fine long blonde hair and I color or do the roots about every 3 mos. I was having a huge slow down in growth, as well, I was shedding big time. If my fine hair had a snag or tangle, forget it - a chunk of like 20 strands would come out. Haven't seen that since using monoi! Also, there is literally no hair on my comb after using now. I have been using this for 4 months. It's an easy to use system. Also, I discovered it from my mother in law who uses it, and she is black with straightened/permed hair so I'm pretty sure this works well for everyone, as the two of us have completely different hair types but we both love the CD Monoi products!"
39,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells wonderful,"I have thick, curly hair. I use this about once every 6 weeks or so and I leave it on my head for about an hour. Smells wonderful"

42,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reduce,This hair mask strengthened my hair and reduced shedding but not so much to hydrate the hair but I also did not use the monoi shampoo i used rosemary by carols daughter shampoo instead maybe that makes a difference.

50,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle Product for Curly and/or Dry Hair,"I am multi-racial  and have curly hair and I use this mask twice a week and every time after I do I get compliments on my hair. I think it's hard to have naturally curly hair that is moisturized, healthy and shiny and this product goes a long way in helping make that happen. It's really simple to make a part of your regular routine too. I just put it on in the shower, throw on a shower cap, shave my legs and do my normal washing then take off the shower cap and rinse. You don't have to sit under a dryer for an hour for this product to do it's magic. It also smells great. I would recommend this to anyone with curly or dry hair. Also it's completely worth the money. Even with twice a week use and shoulder length hair I buy it about every two to three months."
51,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best hands down! I usually don't write reviews but this stuff is amazing,I usually don't write reviews but this stuff is amazing. I didn't feel the difference immediately but after the 3rd go round my hair felt softer and silkier.

I recommend this conditioner to all of my family and friends and of course will be buying more

60,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but it's 2oz not 4 😩,This stuff works great. I bought this a while back and just ran out. When I went back into my account to place same order again I realized that my order history says I got 4oz but in fact I only received a 2 oz bottle.Hoping it was an innocent mistake on sellers part but will be buying elsewhere from now on as I am disappointed that I didn't get what I paid for.
61,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Use this and you will love your hair!,"I love this hair product.  I made the mistake of running out and then my local dealer in the city was out of stock to so I was thrilled to find this on Amazon.  This product makes my hair silky soft and really does reduce my breakage.  I'm African American (well according to Ancestry.com 53% African, 26% East Asian and 21% Caucasian) and I stopped relaxing my hair more than a year ago but did not cut it off.  My hair is past my shoulders now and this product has allowed it to grow by helping to minimize the breakage.  I use the Monoi shampoo first then put on the repairing mask and sit under a warm dryer for 20 minutes.  I then style my hair as usual.  I highly recommend this product."
62,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,True to Name,"It is a great product. I use it along with other monoi products, it has been very effective in stopping breaking and shedding, and helping with my hair growth."

The label says that you have 96% less breakage after one use and it's true!  I have fine, highlighted hair and it keeps the highlights well conditioned but doesn't weigh my hair down.  I have also purchased the monoi shampoo and love it as well.  This is the only conditioner I will use.  I highly recommend it for anyone!"

123,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,Unable to use item due to it being damaged
124,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best conditioner ever used,"I'm an African-American woman with thick, natural 4b hair that hits around mid-back length when it is flat ironed.  The Monoi Hair Mask is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used on my natural hair.  After I wash my hair with As I Am Coconut Cowash I apply Monoi and leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse out.  My hair is a bed of well defined, super soft curls that can be easily combed out or finger combed.  If I'm doing my hair at home, I simply finger comb my hair (which, thanks to Monoi only takes a couple of minutes), apply a generous amount of SheaMoisture Curl & Define Milk and let it air dry.  My curls are defined, soft, and last until I am ready to wash them again.  If I am getting my hair professionally done, I take Monoi to the salon with me to use for my deep conditioning treatment.  My stylist loves it.  And because Monoi conditions so well, I experience significantly less hair breakage during the comb out process.  Carol's Daughter products are either a hit or severe miss for me, but the Monoi Hair Mask is definitely a hit.  I HIGHLY recommend this product for natural, Afro-textured hair.  The downside is the price.  For the price I think customers should be granted a bigger jar.  I get about 6-8 applications per jar; that said I apply the product very liberally, so others may be able to get a few more applications out of it than I do."
125,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite Carol's daughter product to date!,"I received this from a monthly natural hair subscription and I was really happy about that cause I wanted to try it since Moknowshair recommended this as an elasticizer. I have kinky, wavy, curly hair that sometimes experiences some droopiness so I like to add a really good protein treatment here and there.The good:Smell. This has a really light floral scent that I didn't mind. It wasn't too much of anything and it did not linger in my hairConsistency. This has a nice thick, creamy texture that is super rich and moist feeling. It went into my hair like a dream and absorbed really well. What I mean is that it melted into my hair with no problems which let me know that it was working.Slip: OMG, this has SOOO much slip! I had absolutely no problems detangling my hair after having it in a wash n go for a week. I did not detangle or moisturize for that entire week prior to application. (I have to make a note that I use a oil to pre-poo and I did not attempt to detangle until after I had sat for 20 minutes with this in my hair under a hooded dryer. I don't detangle until I let my conditioner do its job.)The bad:Not much, but I have to say that I was not impressed with the effectiveness at ""repairing,"" maybe because its a mask and not a deep treatment. I have used other treatments before that I can see the difference right away. This was not the case with this product.Overall: Despite not seeing results right away I would use this product again. It is not at the top of my list, but it is by far my favorite Carol's daughter product to date!"
126,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I feel slightly bad at lowering by one star, but here is why... the product works great, but the scent really is strong for the rest of the day, and I LOVE the scent of gardenia, but it was a bit overwhelming for me, and I'm not highly sensitive to scent.So, this is EASY to use, and for me, a little goes a long way.  I really concentrate this on the ends of my hair.  I wash and condition like normal, and about once a week I put this on the bottom few inches of my hair and take an extra long shower.I really have noticed an improvement in my hair, which becomes brittle in summer (playing in the pool with the kids and being out in the sun dry my hair) and winter (dry, cold air) months.  I've noticed less breakage and fewer split ends.  My hair is also not as frizzy.  I have naturally wavy/curly hair, and I have to be careful styling it in the morning or I get frizz, then I have to be careful getting caught in the wind or rain as that too will trigger frizz.  I do think this helps reduce frizz on those days when frizz is just not avoidable, which I love."
127,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Provides major moisture to dry hair,"I have fine textured blond/gray hair (not really sure how much is gray since I have it colored and highlighted) that has been getting dryer as I get older. It's nice because my bangs aren't greasy and plastered to my forehead by noon on hot days after being shampooed in the morning. But it also means that my hair is more subject to breakage and it's been getting a little thinner over the years. This is a very nice product because it adds a lot of moisture to my hair. I use it at night when I'm going to wash my hair in the morning. I take a small amount (it doesn't take much) on my fingers and rub it between my hands and then through my hair. A lot could be used, or a little, depending on how much conditioning I want. Then I go to bed and wash it out in the morning.Even with my hair pretty well coated, it took only a lather of my shampoo and then a repeat to remove it. I used a Suave brand shampoo. I was afraid it would leave behind oil and weigh down my hair, but it didn't. It seemed to absorb into my hair at night and wash out in the morning. My hair looks soft and styles easily with just a warm blow dryer. (I know, blow drying can damage hair, but it looks totally blah if I just let it air dry. I need the lift of the blow dryer.)This will be a good treatment to use a couple times per week for me. Adding a very small amount to dry hair would probably make it more manageable if I had coarser or thicker hair. The only downside I can see to this product is the rather strong Gardenia fragrance. I like a small amount of the fragrance but this is pretty intense. I would buy the product in an unscented version or perhaps a different scent (lemon? herbal?) if it were available. If not, I will probably buy this scent because I like the feel of the product and the way it performs."
128,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For me this is a very pleasant smelling, softening, detangling, protien fortifying, and breakage preventing mask conditioner for the hair. I haven't use the shampoo, or the regular conditioner yet that goes with this brand. I am used to paying around this amount for a higher end grocery store available product, so I might just do that and update this review.  I styled my hair right after the shampoo and conditioning. The shampoo i used is a medium priced product like this one. It is also a sulfate free product as the shampoo corresponding with this brand is. The styling went very well, and I actually got a compliment on my hair; though, I am not sure why since I didn't do anything to my hair but maybe muss it up a little bit with a blow dryer, which separates my waves a bit, and it makes them stand out more. I have very fine, and particularly fragile waves. My hair almost gets curly in the back, yet in front  I have a haircut that compensates for the lack of curl pattern. Yet my hair was very wavy when I used the product. Today, i used regular conditioner,  and my hair is so soft. My hair is relatively healthy, yet of course when it is fragile as it is, it is a concern to strengthen it. The fragrance, the ingredients, the results, all desirable for me. I will continue to use this brand for a while to see how I like it  as a set. It isn't necessarily a big deal for me to have a shampoo that works the best possible. What is a concern for me is how the conditioner works. So I could use an inexpensive shampoo really, and get similar results. I just want to try this line just the same. Worth noting, though, that if you put the lid directly underneath the jar, it will disappear into a space. I've had to fish it out with onlin Worth noting, though, that if you put the lid directly underneath the jar, it will disappear into a space. I've had to fish it out with knife.

129,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Second time's a charm,"Has a really nice smell, and a little goes a long way.  I have very thick 2c hair (wavy and coarse), color treated, often straightened, and several inches past my shoulders.  This hair mask is thick and easy to apply with no drips.  I used about 1/3 the amount I would use of regular conditioner.  it is easy to rinse out and did not leave a greasy feel or residue.  The first time I tried it I got out of the shower and waited about 10 minutes before returning to the shower and rinsing.  I was disappointed to notice little or no change in my frizzy, somewhat dry hair.  However, the second time I used it I just stayed in the shower and left it on for five minutes or so.  This time my hair was noticeably softer and less frizzy, requiring substantially less leave-in hair product than usual, even into the second and third days between shampoos.  Normally the second day after shampooing I have to apply a little more leave-in conditioner and flat iron some of the frizzies away, but I was able to brush my hair and just dampen/scrunch it slightly and wear it wavy again.  I really like this conditioner now and will continue to use it once or twice a week to keep my hair softer and  more manageable."
130,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have really damaged hair.  It has been bleached and colored and spent the summer in the pool.  My hairdresser said I would have to cut at least 3 inches off to get rid of all of the damage.  It has split ends and is breaking a lot.  Oh and I let a trainee stylist use a curling iron on my which further fried it as well as my scalp.  I have straight fine hair so the damage is really noticeable.I am not going to claim this is a miracle but after two uses (one per week) leaving it in my hair overnight, I have reduced the breakage and split ends.  It is still in bad shape but I think that it has really helped save my hair.  This does not leave my hair feeling greasy or cause it to be flat.  It is much more manageable My hairdresser was really impressed with the results.  I use a voluminizing shampoo and conditioner after using this overnight.  I couldn't find any directions for blonde hair so I am just guessing with how I have used other hair repair masks.  I think it is really made a difference in fixing the damage."
131,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have been using Carol's Daughter hand cream and love it, so I thought I would try their hair mask. Unforntuely, the top had broken and seal had broken too during shipping, so when I got it, it was a gooy mess. I only marked down by 1 star for that reason, but still used the product and absolutely love it!! See my pictures.It's so funny, I thought I ordered skin cream and put it on my skin and loved it, LOL! Then realized it was hair cream so I washed my hair and let this sit on my hair for about 10 minutes...wow!!! My hair is normally very dry and broken ends, but this made my hair so lovely and smooth and soft. The scent is very intreging to me. It has a woodsie, yet feminine scent. I little bit perfumey, but lovely. I tend to like natural scents, or mens fragrances and this is wonderful!! I absolutely love it and use it as skin cream too. It you have oily hair, you probably won't like it, but with my dry hair and skin, I love it!!! My new favorite!!!"
132,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like other Carol's Daughter products, this does not disappoint! The repairing hair mask is amazing and leaves my hair soft, healthy and smelling wonderfully. I put this on about once a week or every other week depending on how much I wash my hair (definitely more often in the summer because of how dry my hair gets from the beach water and pool chlorine). I leave it on after I shampoo for about 10-15 minutes and voila, my hair feels amazing! I definitely recommend this product for anyone struggling with dry hair!"
133,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hair feels soft and smells incredible!,"This stuff smells AMAZINGGGGGGGGG. If you like gardenia, which I love. I have shoulder length hair that is pretty damaged from bleaching and dyeing. I'm half Asian with naturally very dark brown hair. I had it blonde for a while and now it's red, so that's a lot of processing. And I blow dry my hair after I wash it as well as using a flat iron to style it. I usually towel dry my hair and then apply this, wrap my hair up into a bun and secure with a clip and leave it in for about 20 minutes. Then I just rinse my hair under the faucet in the bathtub. It does keep my hair feeling pretty soft, but I honestly haven't noticed a difference in the way it looks. The thing I love love love about this is that the amazing smell lasts and lasts and lasts. I don't wash my hair often (about twice a week), and the gardenia smell is still there until the next wash. Overall, it's not a miracle product but I really like it a lot for the way it makes my hair feel and smell."
134,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This is an amazing hair mask. I have used it twice and my hair is noticeably softer, shinier and tangle free. I wash my hair as usual and towel dry it. Then  I massage the hair mask into my hair from roots to ends and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before rinsing it off. It also has a great, light floral scent that I enjoy.My only quibble about this hair mask is the packaging. The plastic tub feels cheap and flimsy. The lid seems pretty fragile as well. For the price and the performance, I would expect a little more solid and luxurious packaging.Overall, the hair mask is awesome and does what it says. It makes my hair silky, soft and manageable. I love the results I got from using it just twice so far. It is a little expensive but well worth it."
135,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"At the time of review writing I did not have a price listed on the product page so I cannot be sure how to compare this against most other leading brands that claim to do the same. But based on the feedback from other reviewers in the past it sure seems expensive. Anyways, This does work reasonably well for conditioning your hair. It does render your hair soft and manageable. The smell is floral strong but pleasant. The minor quibble I have is the container! it does tend to be messy as the top lid sticks with the plastic seal. Overall I think this is okay product. Rating with three stars!"
136,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"We use this on our granddaughters hair. She has extremely curly and unruly hair, and it's often rough and dry. Carol's Daughter Monoi repairing mask makes it feel smooth and soft. It's easy to use and it smells wonderful while she is using it, and for a good while after. The effects are not as good as we had hoped, but it's still much better than many similar products that we've tried.  If my own hair wasn't so thin and soft, I'd use this simply because it smells so good. She's happy with it, and we will purchase it after the sample bottle is gone."

I recommend purchasing from the actual Carol's Daughter website though. Right now they are selling a supersize (16oz) version of this conditioner for only $26. That's more than double the amount, for a fraction of the cost. I just purchased two 16oz containers and along with additional discounts, I only paid $46 plus tax.

142,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Reviewed by my wife: I think I'm done with Carol's Daughter. It gets such good reviews from others, and with the high price point, I kept thinking I was just not getting it, and that if I were to keep trying I'd find some that I love. Usually I love the perfume and hate the frizz it leaves (as in the case of a conditioning oil, a shampoo, and a conditioner); with this one, I hate the perfume (smells too strong, and sort of like 1970s Avon to me) and find that the mask has no particular conditioning properties. Too much money, and doesn't work for my Caucasian loose curly hair."

Someone had made a comment stating this product didn't have instructions; I thought I'd let people know instructions ARE present on the product yet hidden like that of a medicine bottle, requiring you to peel the label on the container. You simply apply the conditioner to your hair after using shampoo, let it sit in your hair for 5 minutes, then rinse out. Letting the conditioner sit in your hair is CRITICAL in getting the maximum results this conditioner intended. Overall, amazing product!"

Typically, once my hair grows past shoulder length the ends start to become very dry and brittle.  I recently cut my long dried out hair up to my shoulders in an attempt to prevent damage and grow out healthy hair.  I have been using this product for the past 12 weeks (A little went a long way for me, I was able to stretch out 2oz over that entire time) along with Josie Maran Argan Oil and I am happy to say that while my hair is growing out past my shoulders it is not dry and I do not have nearly as many split ends as I usually do.

It’s thick, and a little goes a long way.Because my hair was so damaged, I first used it on my hair overnight.Now that the perm damage is long gone, I still use it once or twice a week depending on the “Florida Humidity” level. I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs an occasional deep conditioner or like me, had some serious hair damage.It’s not a conditioner you use every day, so don’t let the small-ish container fool you.

From the marketing, it looks like this product is meant for African-American hair. However, I'm white with completely straight, very fine hair (the exact opposite of typical African-American hair), so don't be scared away if you don't have curly or thick hair. This product works wonders for those of us with chronically dry hair. I've never been able to grow my hair past about 2"" below my shoulders because the ends just break off no matter what I do. But these products have changed that and my hair is now down below my shoulder blades. For the first time in my life I'm going to have to ask my stylist to take off some length!"

229,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super thick,I got this as a gift when I was deployed to Afghanistan. My hair was really dry and damaged due to the high heat and hard water. This was GREAT. I couldn't use it everyday because it was too heavy for my thin hair but once a week worked perfectly. Smells amazing too.
230,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product!!!!!,"Amazing conditioning and deep conditioning power! Brings the dry, brittle and dull hair back to life.  This is a must try for all hair types!"

Of course, my hair is neither dry, dull, or damaged--so I'm betting that would be the ticket for seeing some improvement. I'm sold on the shampoo and conditioner, but I'll leave this product behind for next time."

234,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This,"Love the Scent/Aroma.  My hair is so soft after using this product.  omg I love this scent so much that I put a lil bit in my hair  in between shampoos.  This is a must have!  Would have given 5 stars but there are NO directions with this product. And white print on label blends right into gold label so it's difficult to read.  Maker's should consider a dark print maybe chocolate brown :o) for ease on eyes and legibility factor.  Come on Carol's Daughter, you gotta start putting instructions for use on your containers!!!  PLZUPDATE:  Found instructions/directions on BOTTOM of the container... honestly no one looks on bottom to find directions but they are pretty legible and easy to understand so gave 4 stars.  However still don't like the white print that blends into gold label on sides and back of container.  So if you are new to Carol's daughter products, look on the BOTTOM of the container/jar/bottle.  Have fun! ;o)"
235,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"Got it for my ex, she loves it"
236,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Really Works,This product really works.  My split ends after using twice are less split. My hair is softer and shines.  I use Monoi Repairing Hair Mask once a week.  I leave it on for 7-10 minutes and immediately I saw results.  I highly recommend.
237,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,I only used this once. There is no instruction on the product i.e. how long to leave it on your hair before you wash it out and how many times a week you should use it. I kept it on for about 10 minutes. It sure did make my hair smooth.
238,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Carol's Daughter Monoi hair mask.,This product did not have the outcome with my hair that I had hoped for. My hair was still dry and felt even dryer after using the mask. I recently purchased the Kenra shampoo and conditioner that I used years ago and I see a difference from using it again. My hair feels amazing now :)
239,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Must Have for 4C,Best deep conditioner on the market!!!!

243,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Amount in Container is too Small,"This worked really great on my thick hair.  I could see less breakage, felt soft & can get a comb through it.  However, the amount in the container is too small the amount of money.  Think of a person with thick hair...it only last about 3 applications or less.  So sad :("

245,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent but too expensive to buy again,This was a decent hair mask. It did make my hair softer. But I didn't think it was worth the price. I'd rather by the Wen Shampoo instead.
246,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,This product has a beautiful fragrance and works well
247,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad results.,I am blown away by the reviews. I tried it and my hair was even more dry than before!! But I was so convinced I was using it wrong or something so I used it again and kept it on much longer and used much more. Same results. Dry! My hair was so frizzy. I had better results with regular redken extreme. Very upset. And for $30...outrageous :-(
248,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,fantastic,This is the first time I am using this product and I have noticed I'm losing less hair when I wash it.  It also gives my hair shine in addition to strength.
249,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Use with Monoi Shampoo,I dont know yet just how effective this product is but I like how it makes yr hair feel. Soft. I do know that you must use the shampoo with it to expect results. I do love the smell and feel of both combined.
250,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,I was sent a different product,"I ordered this ""Repairing Hair Mask"" from Carol's Daughter... but instead they sent me the Anti breakage spray... I returned it.Not cool."
251,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best detangler mask less breakage of hair,"I love this product . I literally can wash my hair and finger detangle with using this mask. When i do take my detangle brush i have less hair in my brushm The longer you leave in your hair will love you!. I have coil 4c hair . Ive never had a product were a little on your roots to your ends; detangles to slip the coil nappy hair into silky  slip. It glides through. Ive used a lot of products in the past, nothing works like this mask.  I just wished the jar was bigger is my only complaint.  I also leave in some of the product and blow dry straight. My boyfriend  loved smelling  my hair. He said it was a rich smell."
252,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely Strengthens,"This mask is really intense. Did I notice less breakage after one use as the product claims? Yes I did, considerably! I'm sure with further use over time the effects are even greater. I have used the Monoi mask 2 different ways, following the directions on the product. I've used it for about 5 minutes, and I have also used it for 15 minutes with a cap, under a warm hooded dryer for an even deeper treatment. The only problem with the latter is it makes my hair very rough and hard upon rinsing, and I have quite a time restoring the softness. However, when I used it only for a few minutes, my hair feels pretty soft after rinsing. I do prefer deep conditioning so that's a bummer. This is the type of treatment I would use once a month or every other month for a really deep treatment, and to keep my hair strong. It smells like fresh flowers which is a pleasant and tolerable scent, but I am not a fan of it ( I do not like the smell of fresh flowers, I do not like them Sam I am). If you're thinking it smells like coconut, it does not. Overall, this is something that I will continue to use every now and again so it doesn't have to be perfect, it only has to be strengthening, as the product claims, and those claims seem to be pretty well supported given the instant results. I did not use the matching shampoo and the product claims 98% less breakage when used with the Monoi Shampoo.  I have medium textured, chemically treated hair."
253,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Hair Mask,"I'm not usually one to spend a lot of money on hair care products. I usually use drug-store shampoos, and conditioners; however, I have been using the Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, usually once or twice a week, for over a month. I can honestly say that I really like it!Each time I open the container, I am greeted by the most lovely, white floral scent (which I love). It may be a little on the strong side (especially for men), but if you like white floral scents, you will probably really enjoy it.To use this, I use two fingers to scoop out a little bit, rub that into the palms of my hands, and then smooth it over my head as I work it in to my hair. I leave it in my hair while I finish my shower routine (probably 5 mins. or so), and then rinse it out really well.I have thick, wavy hair, and this hair mask leaves my hair soft, tangle free, really helps to tame my usual frizz/flyaways, and makes my hair smell amazing for the entire day. (As a bonus, I find that just having this on my hands to smooth it on my hair, makes my hands noticeably softer!)Even at the price point that this sells for, I will most definitely repurchase this, when I run out."
254,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"Being diabetic I lose a lot of hair.  My hair has gotten weak and breaks off easily.  I use to have thick dense hair but I have lost about 50% of it by now.  After just a couple uses of this I noticed less hair in the shower drain and an incredible improvement on findings lose hairs on my clothing.  I was even shocked that my brushes had less accumulation of hair on them.Monoi translates to ""sacred"" and this for sure has been a sacred repairing hair mask for me.  It smells heavenly and leaves my hair soft and silky smooth.  I plan on trying the entire line of Carol's Daughter Monoi products."
255,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was too heavy for my very fine, short hair but my daughter (who has 3A/B hair that is thick, a mix of fine and coarse, and long) loved it! The scent is tantalizing and it really works to deep condition. She used the entire tub over the course of a month and happily extolled its virtues far and wide. She is not typically a fan of floral scents and this one is strong but she indicated she loved how her hair smelled all day with it. If you are scent sensitive you might want to pass - this one packs a wallop!  It had a fair amount of slip for a deep conditioner and washed out easily. No brittle or dryness encountered (can happen with products with too much protein in them)."

I have used their products on my 7-year-old daughter's hair since she was 3. And even though I am not consistent with detangling and combing and brushing her hair, whenever I apply this repairing hair mask, her hair bounces back.Of course, I wish there was more product for the $$$ but, in the long-run, the expense is worth it.I'd rather spend my money on something that works well than spend a little on something that doesn't do what it says it should do."

This product is a game changer! The first time I put it on my hair after shampooing my hair instantly felt softer and silkier, and it was a cinch to comb through. I use as a rinse-out conditioner in the shower, and to deep condition my hair I sleep in it and rinse it out in the morning. In humid weather I have even left some of the product in my hair, because it also works great as a leave-in. I highly recommend it!"

Three weeks later, and I've used it twice, back to my regular conditioner, and my hair still looks and feels 150% better than it did before!! I will never be without this product. I have used MANY deep conditioning packs, including: Macadamia Oil Pack, Aussie 911, Wen Deep Conditoning, Moroccan Oil Deep Conditioner. NONE of them ever have come close to this stuff! My boyfriend said, ""bloody hell!"" When he saw my hair. (I brushed it through with The Wet Brush, btw, which is also amazing.) So, so happy with this stuff! :D"

I used quite a bit so next time I will not use as much because I forgot how much this stuff costs (I purchased this a year ago -- #productjunkie)  - yikes!  This is expensive  - no wonder its woks!
265,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The BEST in haircare!,"Don't normally review products, but felt compelled to write one as soon as I jumped out of the shower! This product is amazing! If your reading reviews and wondering whether or not you should give it a shot, go for it:) The product is a little on the expensive at $32 when purchased in store, but I do know if you but it in stores or from the Ulta website you get a free Monoi shampoo and conditioner with the mask. All the products in this line work perfectly together so I would recommend purchasing it from an Ulta retailer. I'm Hispanic and have thick, medium-length dark hair. About a year ago I had a traumatic experience with a bad dye job and this product brought my hair back to life! Also, helps restore moisture if you use heat styling tools often. Must have, must keep :) Try it out!"
266,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,I Really Wanted To Like This Conditioning Mask... :-(,"First let me say that I have relaxed/color treated hair.  This mask was recommended to me by a store rep along with the Black Vanilla conditioner for dry scalp & breakage issues.  The Black Vanilla conditioner was awesome!!!  This Monoi, not so much.  I used it after my wash for the first time today & sat under the dryer for a few minutes.  But after the rinse, my hair was SOOOO TANGLED!!!  The comb was barely going through my wet hair.  I tried using another conditioner/detangler, rinsing my hair some more & it was still tangled!  The sound of the comb going through my hair was so crisp & dry.  It was awful!!  I will be returning this in hopes of getting a refund.  I don't plan on using it again & it costs wayyyyy to much to just let it sit around.  I'll probably consider sticking with the Black Vanilla line & replace this Monoi mask with the Black Vanilla Smoothie as a deep conditioner.UPDATE: After drying my hair in rollers, it came out shiny & bouncy. However, my hair is VERY dry especially my scalp.  It just looks & feels dry/crispy.  Also, I was experiencing some INTENSE scalp itching.  I couldn't wait until it was time to get my hair done again to get some relief.  This may be a good product, possibly for a different hair texture like natural hair.  But it just wasn't good for me."
267,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow...Just Wow!,"....I have fallen in love with my natural hair again.  This item is on my ""must have"" list!I am African-American with tightly curled, un-permed (natural) hair.  Previously, after washing my hair, my hair would curl and tangle so tightly that it would take hours to comb. And, hair breakage was horrible.This product is a game changer.  It detangled my hair while making it manageable and silky...and what a delightful smell. Hair breakage has almost been completely eliminated."
268,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monoi is loveley.,Been using this hair mask for yrs. After using the mask my hair smells delish & looks and feels healthier after regular use.
269,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product and good price on Amazon,"Like this product a lot.  I have fine colored hair shoulder length, wavy/slightly curly.  BUY THIS ON AMAZON!  What a great price, 18.00!  I paid 32.00 at Ulta....amazon isn't always the least expensive, but in this case, the savings compared to Ulta is obscene.  I'll never buy there again before comparing to Amazon."
270,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This mask provides good moisture, leaving hair smooth, but the chemical smell, which reminds me of sunscreen, makes it unlikely I'll get it again."
271,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best repairing conditioner I have ever tried,"This is the best repairing conditioner I have ever tried.  I also like the monoi shampoo.  Both product have helped my hair tremendously.  I have very fine, dry and breakable hair.  My hair with these products is stronger and smoother.  I have tried some of the other products but have discovered that some contain alcohol which causes damage to my hair.  So, I am sticking to the Monoi repairing products."
272,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is Awesome!,"I have curly African American 3C hair that is prone to breakage, tangling, brittleness and snapping. This makes my hair easily detangle, smells like gardenia flowers. It is a tan color with a creamy, buttery texture. It doesn't exactly make hair shine, but is great for a leave in conditioner and makes hair even curlier. I liked the price for the amount that you get of 7oz. It doesn't weigh hair down and is not oily. This is perfect for any ethnic hair type or wavy/curly hair for non-ethnic hair. When I put it on my hair I instantly noticed the difference. I love this and plan to buy it for as long as they make the product."
273,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and leaves hair shiny & healthy,"I'm caucasian with hair that's on the fine side. I started highlighting my hair this year and found that after awhile, my hair felt a little dry. I started using this mask once/week and my hair seems to be much healthier and very shiny. LOVE the smell of this hair mask and LOVE that it's easy to use. You put it on after washing and leave it in for 5-7 minutes, then rinse thoroughly."
274,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,PLEASED,"I had just taken out a sew-in that had been in my hair for 5 months. My hair is natural and my textures are 4a/4b. My kinky curlies were in bad shape. This repairing mask was AMAZING. My hair is so soft and manageable! I had little breakage which is GREAT for me...and NO KNOTS!! For those who said their hair was hard; this product has protein which hardens the hair as it dries. The deep conditioning process does not need heat for it to be effective. Just apply, wait, rinse, and enjoy!"
275,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just a little dab will do....,"Yeah, it is pricey, but I think worth it. In my hair arsenal for sure. Following chemo, my kinky hair came back baby fine.  I was pretty scared my hair would snap from braiding or combing.  I use a tiny bit as a leave-in, and my hair breakage seems less.  In addition, it keeps my hair a bit soft and curly. Probably not for everyone, but I sure love this product."
276,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,... hair and this makes it much stronger and smells awesome..,Caucasian female with thin hair and this makes it much stronger and smells awesome.....Love this stuff
277,"Carol's Daughter Monoi Repairing Hair Mask, 4 fl; oz.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Average Deep Conditioner,"This deep conditioner did not outperform the drugstore brands - or at least not for my hair type. I am caucasian with bleachy blonde hair that is very dry & damaged. I was hoping that this project would help mend it, and in fact, I was kind of concerned that this product would actually be ""overkill."" I was disappointed. My hair was no more silky or detangled than when I've used cheaper deep conditioners from lines such as Garnier Fructis or Loreal's sulfate-free line.  I have no problem spending money on a good deep conditioner, and that's what I was looking for.  Maybe this product works better on other hair types, but I wanted to write this review for anyone with MY hair type who might be considering it: it just didn't work.On a positive note: the fragrance of this product is very, very strong when it is in the container, but it does not over-perfume your hair."
