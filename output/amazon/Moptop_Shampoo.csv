0,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing results with just one wash!!!!,"After a summer filled with fun in the pool, my girls hair were feeling waxy & sticky. I couldn‚Äôt brush through their hair, or style their hair no matter what. I would try and brush their hair while braiding and the hair would stick to my hands and tangle while braiding. After speaking to my hair dresser I was on the hunt for clarifying shampoo. I‚Äôve tried a few in the past (high end salon products, MLM stuff & stuff you‚Äôd find at a pharmacy) , but have never been blown away with the results. This stuff though...It was like magic with just one wash. Hair is back to normal texture, and no more tangles or tears. I never leave reviews so for me to come in here and leave one it must be amazing."
1,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY happy to have my curls and clean hair back,"I am surprised how difficult it was to find a clarifying shampoo that I felt would really clean my hair, and I‚Äôm SO glad I found this one! For reference, I have fine, low porosity, low to medium density hair, so my hair gets buildup and gets weighed down super easily. I had tried a couple other ‚Äúclarifying‚Äù shampoos that just made my hair more gross because of the heavy moisturizing ingredients in them. The past few weeks before using this shampoo, my hair somehow was simultaneously greasy and dehydrated because it was blocked from absorbing moisture and everything was just sitting on the surface. This shampoo doesn‚Äôt have anything heavy in it as far as I can tell, and my hair was TRANSFORMED after using it. So so happy!"
2,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite for detox!,"I love this product. I only use it once every month to six weeks to detox my hair from gels and other products. I do the Curly Girl Method so I don't use products with harsh chemicals, but the natural oils and gels I use, do build up a little over time. This cleans my hair so well. Even though its a bit harsher (designed to be that way) for once a month detix shampooing, I love using it. For whatever reason my hair is always curliest after I use it. I figure over the month, the products do weigh my curls down a little."
3,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Funky,"This shampoo smells weird.  When I use it, I kind of feel as though I'm washing my hair with paint thinner.  If I've just shampooed with a clarifying shampoo, then this stuff also sudses pretty well -- a pleasant surprise, since most natural products (in my experience) don't.However, if I've been shampooing with this and conditioning with the MopTop conditioner (no other product of any kind -- no stylers, etc.), I get a lot of buildup, my hair feels gross, and it no longer sudses well.  I don't know if this is a result of the shampoo or the conditioner -- and I have very hard water, so if your water is soft, you might have better results -- but this was a fail for me."
4,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I can‚Äôt recommend this enough,"I‚Äôve had issues with oily hair and itchy, painful, and flaky patches on my scalp for as long as I can remember.I tried this shampoo on a whim, hoping that this product would work out of the what feels like the millions I‚Äôve tried already. I wash my hair once a week due to sensitive skin and such. I used to was it and then the very next day it was so oily I felt gross. With this new shampoo, my hair doesn‚Äôt start getting greasy for a couple of DAYS, I feel like I can actually do things with my hair and go out and do things with my hair. I cant recommend this enough! If you‚Äôre looking for a reason to get this, do it!(I do have bleached and dyed hair, so it works great on that kind of hair too üíï)"
5,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Serious hair detox!,"This shampoo seems to be a serious detox.  I use it 1x 3-4 weeks or so.  I find that I need to heavily moisturize following usage.  I like this shampoo and using it with less frequency makes it a good $$ value.  I am a 2b curl, trying partial curlygirl methods."
6,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaky bottle üò¢,I could tell it smells really nice as soon as I opened the bubble mailer it arrived in because the bottle had leaked all over. I looked inside the bottle to find it at least half gone. There was not 1/2 bottle of product in the bubble mailer so where did it go??? I suspect I was ripped off. Unfortunately I‚Äôm having a hair emergency and really need to detox my hair/scalp so I‚Äôm not bothering with the return. It wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if the product wasn‚Äôt so ridiculously overpriced to begin with. But I literally got half of what I paid for.
7,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer,"Wanted to embrace the waves of 2b, 2c, and 3A curls without sulfates or parabens or the rest of that junk.  This clarifying shampoo is something that has helped me along my journey to embrace what I have been given."

Gentle yet effective. Perfect for deep cleaning styling product and sebum built up. I use this 1-2 times a month. Worth every penny.
9,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",3.0 out of 5 stars,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE For So Little,The quality of this product is a 5 star. I just think you can get the same results from Suave Clarifying which is only a few buck but you get 10 times as much as this teeny bottle.

A Little Goes a L O N G Way with Mop Top's Rescue Treatment!,"MopTop is a great hair care line. While it's geared towards curly girls, anyone can use it. From this Clarifying Rescue Treatment to the custard pudding styling product, it's a terrific line. FYI.. SHAKE this product well before using it."
11,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a full bottle,"Just received the package.  Pulled the shrink wrap from the bottle, opened and there was no seal on the bottle and the bottle isn't even halfway full.  I'm guessing either someone took some for their own stash or the maker is selling a 'full size' bottle that is half full."
12,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so pretty,Bought this because I needed a clarifying shampoo that is CGM approved. My hair gets a lot of build up and gets itchy. This didn't really seem to do a whole lot to help with the itching but did help with build up. I love the smell
13,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not harsh,  good clean","I have medium thick curly hair.  I use cowash during the week and clarify with this once a week.  It's not harsh yet leaves my hair feeling clean.  Its sudsyy but not overly, so you feel like you are getting a good wash. I will be using this from now on"
14,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,This shampoo removed all the product build up in my coily 3C hair.  It gently cleanses and enables the conditioner and other styling products to be absorbed by your hair.  Anyone with 3C hair knows that moisture is important for shine and healthy curls.  This product delivers and is amazing.  It does recommend not to use after freshly dyed hair.  Very happy with the results.
15,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Never again!,"This came highly recommended by a hair blogger. I used it once and my scalp became unbearably itchy. After some googling, I learned that the third ingredient commonly causes allergic reactions. Will never use anything by this company again."
16,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs GREAT!,"I almost never write reviews for products. But if you‚Äôre like me you faithfully read reviews to decide if it‚Äôs worth buying.... let me tell you, this stuff is AMAZING. I have such hard water and I use hair product every day to keep my curls and waves in check. This stuff works great for a detox shampoo. I‚Äôm super impressed and will definitely continue purchasing this product."
17,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great smelling and gentle clarifying shampoo!,"I like how this clarifying shampoo gently cleanses the product buildup off my hair and scalp. It also smells very good! I‚Äôve used it twice so far (30 days apart) and followed it up with a nice deep conditioner. It‚Äôs important to deep condition after using a clarifying shampoo to combat any dryness it may cause. My curls are defined, soft and shiny after I style it."
18,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good detox shampoo,My hair is typically in protective styles so I use this once every 6-8 weeks.  It works well and I use a hot oil treatment aster using it.  It really takes all the buildup from your hair.  Love this!

23,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Used bottle,"Looked like someone either took some out or gave me a used bottle cuz it was half empty. There is also something blue around the rim of The bottle. Besides the plastic rapped around it, it did not come sealed when I removed the top."

It throuroughly cleans my scalp, making it feel refreshed. The only downside is, I have TONS of hair so I finished it in two uses. But I just have waaayyy too much hair."
25,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lasts forever, little amount = lots of suds","Such a small bottle made me nervous, but a pea sized amount of this product goes a long way!

It's super clarifying - definitely only to be used every several weeks so the tiny bottle will last a couple months :)
27,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Left a film on my scalp,This product felt almost impossible to complete wash out and left a weird film on my scalp.
28,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great treatment!,"I love the entire MopTop line. This clarifying shampoo never strips my hair, and it brings my curls back to life! Small bottle but lasts awhile because you only need a tiny bit and you only need to use every few weeks."

35,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Does its job well,Does the job of a great clarifying shampoo but incredibly expensive for the amount of product you receive. However given that it‚Äôll probably only be used once a month it should last awhile. It‚Äôs not meant to be a daily shampoo and could be damaging if used that way
36,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, Citrus Medley, 8oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"Great product,  packaged well. I will probably order again."

0,"ÔªøMopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Caution!,"Let me start by saying I love this product. However, it has no preservatives in it and can actually ‚Äúgo bad‚Äù if it sits to long. I usually get it from my hair salon, but found it here on amazon and decided to order it. When it arrived, the tubs were wrapped in additional plastic (which is different from the salon) and the safety seal was missing. The thing that bothered me though was the color, consistency and smell of the product. It is supposed to smell wonderful (somewhat sweet but not overpowering) with a light opal color the consistency of thick honey. This was fowl smelling, runny and darker than it was supposed to be. Long story long, great product but buy it at a store so you can check it‚Äôs color!"
1,"ÔªøMopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Staple product, consistent results.","This is one of my staple products. I have 2B, low porosity, fine-medium strands, high density hair. This custard smells great and is very concentrated, ensure you emulsify well when applying.  Custards don‚Äôt typically provide a lot of hold but I do think this product has a good amount of hold on its own. I typically use it on wash days but have used it to refresh and it will revive and hold my waves. Product smells great, citrusy like a Kumquat but the smell unfortunately will not linger (I personally would love to smell like this product all day long). The product does contain protein and glycerin. It has held up well even in humidity despite the glycerin content. This is likely because I DO layer this product with 2 other stylers that I think are a great combination and compliment each other superbly. I use the Uncle Funky‚Äôs Daughter Curl Magic as a base, Moptop Curl Custard second, and seal the deal with Jessie Curl Spiralicious. In the pictures my hair looks wet/shiny, but it is fully dry FYI.In case you are wondering I use a cowash, As I Am 2 out of my 3 weekly wash days and clarify with Bounce Curl Clarifying Shampoo, and condition with Bounce Curl Super Smooth conditioner.I went crazy buying a bunch of products when I transitioned to embracing my natural hair, but hands down this product with the combination I mentioned above is a definite winner for my hair type. As you can see, I was so confident in my line-up that I went out to my first dressy outing sporting my natural hair for the first time since my transition and I was not disappointed. It gave me such confidence to know you can look ‚Äúput together‚Äù with wavy/textured hair."
2,"ÔªøMopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",5.0 out of 5 stars,great custard,"This is indeed a great custard, better than the other super famous custard, Kinky Curly. With moptop hair dries faster, I get better definition and glossy clumps. My hair is 2c, fine but dense, dry, heavily highlighted. I really get beautiful results. It is pretty forgiving, as if you use too much, you can easily scrunch out the cast and it won't weight your hair down a bit...this is another big difference with kinky curly...with my hair type it is pretty much impossible to get volume with kinky curly custard, but I get ton of body with lots of movement with moptop custard. The only con is the high content of glycerin that causes frizz in the super humid, high dew points days we have here in Florida. In those days, I can't usually use moptop by itself as a solo styler, but I need to top it with a hard hold-no/low glycerin gel (great with AG liquid effects, or Biosilk hard rock gelee). Not a big deal, I still get the good definition and bounciness moptop gives."

I don‚Äôt know how I have gone all this time without knowing about this product.

On the description of the product it said that this hair product was paraben-free. sulfate-free, and many other things free. I was very disappointed when I read the ingredients of the product and found out that there is sulfate in the conditioner. I purchased this item because it said it was all natural and free from any chemicals. Very, Very disappointed."
5,"ÔªøMopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great healthy gel alternative,"This custard is more like a light hold gel for wash and go days. I have wavy frizzy hair and this left my hair with almost totally frizz free, soft, bouncy curls. It definitely has a funky slimy texture with a strong fruity citrus smell but the smell dissipates as it dries.Pros:Adds shineSoft not crunchy curlsLightweightNatural ingredientsAffordableCons:Tames most frizz but not allOverall I am pleased to have this on hand. It is a much better alternative to the unhealthy ingredients I got from my previous gel. Still looking for something natural to completely tame my frizz without looking like a grease ball.UPDATE: After a few months of use I found that if I use a little more on top where I'm most prone to get frizz it will make a slight cast that I can break after it dries and then I'm frizz free! I just pull the locks through my fingers to unstiffen it until it looks natural.I'm also so impressed with how much volume I get with this. It doesn't weigh down my hair even though I add extra on top. Updating my rating to 5 stars. I use it daily after showering or to refresh curls. I still have plenty left. I'd guess with my medium length hair it will last at least 6 months. Great natural product and value!"

It does leave your hair soft and very curly but after your hair is dry it also has a white flaky layer that forms and falls off like dandruff. It did the same thing on my moms hair."
8,"ÔªøMopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-aloe,"I wanted to love this gel, I really did, but it's just not for me. It smells amazing and it has this really interesting thin consistency that seems perfect for not weighing down my curls.And yet, here I am, the fourth wash day using this product, and I have conceded defeat. I kept getting fuzzy, frizzy, stringy, undefined curls and I could not for the life of me figure out why. Turns out, aloe is a problem for a lot of curlies. If your hair is instantly frizzing and losing it's ""clumpage"" when you add this gel, consider that your hair might not like aloe. Look up flash-drying.I don't want to give this product a bad rating just because I didn't know aloe wouldn't work with my hair. After all, it seems to work well for lots of people! I just hope this review helps someone else who is struggling with this gel and can't figure out why."

  ¬†This stuff is my new go-to! Wish i found it sooner.I‚Äôve never been quite sure what the difference between gel and custard/jelly is ‚Äî there are so many different types of products out there! But in my experience I‚Äôve found custards and jellys to clump my hair nicely but not necessarily define them, and I‚Äôve found them to leave my hair looking a little greasy and leaving a weird residue on them, whereas I‚Äôve found gels to define and hold hair much better, but often leave it crunchy with lots of flyaways. Also, gels hold seems to be too strong and leaves a lot of my waves/curls misshapen. This product has a unique texture, not 100% like either gel or jelly (see video)My hair ranges from ‚Äòs‚Äô wave patterns to curls (mostly underneath.) The top is prone to extreme frizziness and just general ‚Äúpoof‚Äù and the front pieces that frame my face are prone to losing all wave pattern. This product seems to address all my hair concerns: manages frizz, boosts curl patterns where it‚Äôs needed, and holds pretty well without leaving a weird greasy residue.Overall I‚Äôd say this product is the perfect medium between jelly and gel! More hold than a jelly but less crunch than a gel. It smells great too and i like that it comes in a jar.

Great for curly, frizzy, wavy hair in any humidity","This stuff is great! It smells slightly citrusy but not sweet, a little like baby aspirin, lol, but the smell is nice and is not strong. The texture is hard to describe - it is thick and maybe best described like ""slime"" but not slimy. It is thick and luxurious. You will only need a little to apply to your hair; I have long, thick hair, and I use about two quarter size blobs. Run through wet or damp hair and comb through, fluff your curls and then leave your hair alone. You will find that your curls are well defined, moist, and not frizzy at all. The product can be a little stiff, but if you shake your hair out, the stiffness goes away. There is absolutely no flaking at all with this product. I am also allergic to a lot of gels and mousses (the perfumes cause scalp problems), but I have no problems with this product at all. I'm picky with hair products, and I've tried a million of them. I will buy this one again!"

I have wavy 2b hair, and ever since using this product I've noticed such a change in its texture and shine. I can go longer between wash days, which in turn means my hair is looking a lot healthier and shinier. My main concern when first buying this was that it wouldn't lather as well or that my hair wouldn't be as clean and I am so happy I was wrong. The lather is a little less voluminous than your standard bottle of shampoo but it will still keep your hair very clean without making it feel like straw. Aside from all of this, a major highlight of this shampoo is the bamboo scent. I have been asked by three to four people about this shampoo because of the smell alone.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't come in a bigger size ( please make a 16 oz. version!!). Highly recommend!"

Liquids are too light and don't offer enough slip, and creams are too heavy and leave my waves/curls weighed down. This one is just right! It looks like a thick cream but it goes on very light. I apply it from my ears down and it leaves me with bouncy, moist curls. I adore the bamboo essence scent, which is very light and fresh with a slight citrus smell to it."

Along with Curly Girl advice, I have kept my thinning strands from frizzing (thanks Mother Nature) using that mousse and conditioning with every wash.  But I was curious to try a curly hair custard and, on a whim, bought this.  I am so glad I did. This holds my large spiral pattern as well as my old mousse, but my hair looks fuller, feels bouncier and softer.  Like there's nothing weighing it down. And on day 2, I can spritz my hair with water, scrunch, and it perks right up again.  Trying that with the Garnier left my hair looking a little flat and dirty.A small amount does the trick on my shoulder length bob, applied by scrunching it thru fairly wet strands and then carefully drying with a diffuser.  The citrus scent is nice.  The price no longer bothers me because that container is going to last me awhile and the results can't be beat.  Highly recommend!"

You know what I mean- totally wet it, work in fresh product, diffuse.....I have enough hair that that gets annoying.BUT with Mop Top I get out of the shower on day one and split my wet hair down the middle, over my shoulders, take a very small scoop of the goo and twist and finger brush it through each section. Then I flip my head, scrunch my hair and diffuse.I have noticed that a tiny bit of product goes a long way and it can get crunchy, but I solve that by just rolling my curls between my hands in sections to loosen the crunch and it‚Äôs perfect!Then, my favorite part about this product:I don‚Äôt wash my hair every day when I shower. I may go 3-4 days no wash. But like I said with my previous product: I would have to re-do the entire curly process if I wanted my hair done daily. NOT with Mop Top. A few sprays with a water bottle to reform the bed head (not even enough worth diffuse drying) and boom! My hair looks like day one! For all three days! No extra product!

It foams up great and the bamboo essence scent is divine (it's a fresh, light scent with a hint of citrus). It cleans thoroughly, but like all sulfate free shampoos, there are some tricks to helping it clean properly. You must use LOTS of water...add more water, not more product, if you feel like you need more cleaning power. Also, let it sit just a bit longer than regular shampoo. After that it will leave your hair squeaky clean, with no scalp irritation from harsh sulfates. It does not dry my hair out."

I have tried so many products so when I came across this stuff I was like Yes! I need to try it. Well the first time I applied it I didn't seem to put enough in my hair (it doesn't state how much to put in your hair so it's trial and error I guess). Before I used it the next time I searched You Tube I found the creators page and watched how she applied it. Well she put on tons it seemed. My hair is about 3 inches shorter and so I tried to adjust the amount. My hair came out crunchy and nothing like hers. Then later that night my hair looked like I had dandruff and my head itched the rest of the night. I should have washed my hair that night because my scalp itched all night. I got up first thing and washed my hair really good but it still itched. I don't think I'll try it again for that reason. I can't stand my scalp itching!

I was recommended to try this, but I couldn't find it in the local stores.  I purchased on Amazon, and it does work for my hair.  Makes it more curly and not all frizzy.  I don't have to use that much either, so this will last a good amount of time.  I do only wash twice a week though.

That is when I discovered that I have low porosity hair, and that the Deva curl gel is full of protein, which is not good for low porosity hair So, I went looking for something with minimal protein and found the Mop Top curly hair custard. I wasn't expecting much, because there are no curl holding chemicals in this gel, but I was very surprised to see that my hair was both fluffy and curly after just one little scoop (3 fingers) of gel. With Mop Top, less is more, so you don't need much. To refresh second day curls, just put a dash of gel and leave in conditioner in a small spray bottle with water. Spray and scrunch, and your curls will hold another day or two, even on fine hair. What I like the most is that this product never weighs down your hair. And it smells citrusy, which I like a lot."

For a low-poo it sudses up amazingly, and is easy to scrub into my scalp. I can tell it doesn't cleanse my scalp as well as my clarifying shampoo, but that is to be expected. I will use it 3 out of 4 washes to encourage the natural oils in my hair. It has a great balance of protein vs. moisture. And best of all is the scent - I didn't know bamboo could smell so good!

Then I step out and apply a liberal amount of the Curly Custard, being sure to flip upside-down and side-to-side. Then scrunch scrunch scrunch.

Didn't provide any better results than lesser expensive products I can buy at my local retail outlet. I bought this because it is natural and minus the sulfates, which can dry out and damage hair and scalp.

I also changed shampoos at the same time, using a cleansing conditoner free of sulfates.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't really made a difference. Additonally, it tends to create a slightly crispy texture in my hair.  This will probably not be the experience for most people as I have very, very kinky, frizzy curly hair. Although each folicle is very fine, I have a lot of it, and WITH the extreme curl, it often feels almost coarse.I am Scotch Irish and just have crazier hair than most people here buying this product.

Research suggested that hair similar to mine benefits most from lightweight, moisturizing products. I ended up focusing more on using a lower number of moisturizing products instead of multiple lightweight products. I've used As I Am Leave In Conditioner for my dry hair since before I started this hair journey but decided to ditch it if I'm going to add on a curl activator/enhancer/gel. I tried Cantu Curl Activator, which did almost nothing to define my waves and made my hair more frizzy. I tried Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie which did help enhance my waves (not in the back though), provided decent moisture, reduced some frizz, but did not have much hold- next day waves were basically not a thing and frizz was back. Adding in Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel gave me almost no hold (Upon purchasing I didn't realize it was a light hold gel) and was very drying so I ditched that quickly and replaced it with Eco Style Gel (strong hold gel). It did help with definition and hold all around, not drying, but it wasn't optimal. I moved on to Aunt Jackie's Defining Curl Custard and no gel which impressed me with the moisture, decent hold, reduced frizz, and enhanced definition even in the 2A back of my hair- but it contains silicones that I knew would eventually weigh down my hair. Mop Top Curly Hair Custard Gel had been on my list of CGM approved products to try and I should've gone with it ages ago because this product goes beyond Aunt Jackie's. I have defined waves all around, equal hold, and it is moisturizing. I've gotten the best defined next day waves compared to all other products I've tried. With other/no products, my halo frizz is usually worse the second and third day- but even with humectants being predominant in this product, I have had no halo frizz. I usually get frizz in both dry and humid environments, I have not yet had a chance to test it on a sufficiently humid day. I am optimistic though."

Finally a good hair curl product!!!,"When I was younger I had super straight hair.  Seriously!  Sometimes I had to perm it twice (it was the 80's when spiral perms were ""in"") just to get the curls to stick.  Over the years my hair has evolved and it has slowly developed major frizz.  However, recently I've discovered that when tamed, that frizz is actually waves/curls!  I've purchased some creams and mousses recently to make the most out of my curls, but all of the products I've tried have always resulted in tacky-to-the-touch, frizzy and crunchy stiff hair.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos and some of the ladies raved about this product and their curls did look lovely so I thought I'd by a jar and give it a try.  My jar arrived today and tonight I tried it.  It's AMAZING!!!  I towel dried my hair and applied this product to my damp hair.  This ""custard"" is runny but a little goes a long way so it didn't take much to cover my thin/fine hair.  I loved that it wasn't tacky and cause my hair to stick to my hand when I applied it.  I let my hair air-dry and I was happy to see that every time I checked on it, my curls were curling and there wasn't any frizz in sight!  When my hair was about  75% dry, I decided to defuse it and really give it the frizz test.  Once again... no frizz and my curls were even more prominent!  I've been disappointed by so many products over the years so I am so incredibly happy to find a hair product that surpassed my expectations!  I'm new to MopTop hair products but I'll definitely be giving other MopTop products a try in the future.I highly recommend this product."

I used this after using shampoo and conditioner and it was NOT thick enough nor did I feel like it penetrated the hair shaft. I tend to look the other way when I see a product that claims to work on ALL hair types including fine hair... I am a women of color and my hair is FAR from fine. Save your money if you have kinky coarse textured hair as this will not be enough for you. If you have fine hair and are type 3 and above will probably work great for you.

I decided to give their leave-in Conditioner a try as I do still get the flyaway frizzy stuff especially in humid weather . I have to admit that it feels strange when first applying to my hair , and I initially thought this would turn out to  be too heavy for my fine , slightly wavy hair , however after drying ( I only partially blow dry , I don't have enough time to be bothered with a full blow dry ) my hair isn't weighed down , it doesn't look greasy , it's shiny , smells good and it's soft . The frizzies are reduced to almost non existent . You don't need to use a lot of this either , my hair is half way down my back and it's fairly thick , I only use an amount that would equal maybe 2 nickels stacked on my palm and it does the job ."

I can use a small amount (less than a teaspoon for sure) on my thick, wavy-to-curly, shoulder length hair and I get nice, soft, lovely waves/curls for at least three days. It renews with water in the morning. Plus, my head never gets itchy and there‚Äôs no build up of product on my hair or scalp.

But the humidity is now at a point here in Georgia that I can‚Äôt wear it straight even with anti-humidity hairspray. Some aspects that I was dreading was my hair not drying for six hours and significant gel residue on the nape of my neck and on my chest that is even hard to get off with wet towel.  Thankfully Kinky Curly was out of stock. I washed my hair and applied Moptop and went outside in the hot sun and did yardwork. Sweating profusely. Most of my hair dried though! I pulled and stretched out the curls and still have good definition. Going out for a walk with temp still 86f. Will see how good of a hold I keep. That is always a challenge for me though. End of day my curls have lost a lot of definition. I have super fine non porous bi racial hair and have to scrunch my hair to get curls and use tangle teaser too, to help bring out my curls.

An hour after application, my hair looks like a frazzled mess that hasn't been conditioned in ages. The weird chemical smell lingers and is pretty unbearable, too. Hair feels somehow both dry and greasy (!) to the touch.I have wavy 2b/2c hair and this might work for other types, even though this type of product usually works quite well for me, so I really just think it's this particular brand.I see other reviews saying that the product sold on Amazon might have gone bad or is not comparable to the product you can buy elsewhere. Maybe that's the problem? Either way, I strongly recommend you don't order this for your hair!"

I have mulitextured hair ranging from 2b to 3a. It's fine to medium and medium density. The Moptop custard does not weigh my hair down at all and it doesn't leave a productly film I often get from other products. It definitely enhances my texture and gives me volume.

It has shine and softness again.  No other deep conditioner has worked this effectively.  This morning I used Quidad moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (blue line), then It's a 10 leave-in + keratin (orange top) spray onto drenched curls, and easily finger-combed the Mop Top curl custard through, and scrunched several times.  Plopped my hair up in terry turban, while completing other tasks worth about 5-7 minutes. Removed towel and clipped roots up.  Once dry enough, removed clips.  My hair looked so good all work day.  Left a light gel cast, similar to Devacurl gel, until I manually loosened them up.  Then the hair was soft and even more shiny.  This product is a must if you have over dry curls."

The barcode/info sticker looked like it had gotten wet at some point. However the contents of the container appear to be in good condition.Performance: nice texture to the gel, applies easily, smells good, dries relatively quickly. Decent amount of hold but more difficult to completely break the cast than Kinky Curly custard. Does have a lot of glycerin in it so it is not good in the summer humidity. My normally minimally frizzy 2b wavy hair looked poodle-esk after only a few minutes out air conditioning. I also had some white flaking as it apparently interacts with Miss Jessie‚Äôs  curl cream.Overall it‚Äôs an okay purchase if it‚Äôs not humid outside and I‚Äôm in a hurry to leave the house with dry hair.

I have tried so many conditioners, and can not handle chemical smells. This is scented with citrus essenial oils, and the smell does not linger.

I got recommended a bunch of products but was looking for a more affordable option for my 4 year old.  I really like this stuff.  It smells great (so good that I use it in my hair to keep down my fly always because of the nice scent!).  It helps define her curls in the morning.  We hair wash at night, so by morning her hair is just a wavy bed head mess.  All I really need is this Mop Top stuff, although sometimes I do a detangler or mousse.

I've tried other custards and a flaxseed gel with the same consistency and it just isn't my thing. I have fine hair, and used this at the beginning of my CG transistion, so it was kind of a 2a-2b wave. The product was nice for a wash-and-wear, one product look. It also smells like Sprite to me, which is a pleasant and not over powering smell. Unlike some custards, it didn't make my hair look stringy if I used a little too much.

I really like it for both of our hair. It actually leaves my daughter's fine hair kind of plumped. If you leave it in awhile, it deeply moisturizes and feels almost like buttery smooth. Yet still is so light, unlike butters and oils that weigh hair down.  It's keeping my 2B waves much more bouncy as oppose to some of the heavier butter like cowashing I did in the past.

I‚Äôm a loyal Deva Curl user for many years but my curly hair is getting looser the older I get, and a good product is needed more than ever to alleviate frizz and define curl. The smell is a mild citrus, very tolerable, and the texture appears water soluble and blended well into my damp hair. No residue and dried slightly crisp which I could somewhat shake out. However I prefer a stronger hold, especially as the day wears on in humidity. The key is to leave your hair alone when you apply product and that‚Äôs always a challenge.

A little bit of this goes a long way and you really don't need to use more than a nickel to quarter size amount depending on how much hair you have. Too much will actually cause you to end up with flakes so definitely start cautiously until you figure your perfect amount out.

I like this product for my curly frizz-prone hair.  I find that I get the best results mixing it with some DevaCurl, otherwise it can get pretty crispy by the time I add enough to cover my hair.  I ordered this when my sample ran out, and was excited that it arrived today.  Unfortunately, it had oozed out of the jar despite being wrapped in bubble wrap because there was no seal on the inside of the product.  It makes me concerned about the product integrity.  Not sure if I'll order again based on that, and that bums me out."

Got more frizz than normal. Was very soft and I did get a small cast so I tried more product and that helped. I just don't think it has the hold I need.

I absolutely love the smell, but it doesn't work as well as some other gels. It still does a pretty solid job for my 2B/2C mix hair.

I have very straight, fine, thinning hair that is going through changes due to hormones. It doesn't dry out my scalp, has a lovely, light scent that isn't overpowering at all, especially since I don't usually buy scented things due to allergies. It's great for my kids' hair too, although it stings if it gets in their eyes.

It's my favorite gel for my 3a(ish) hair. I use it in combination with a curl cream, because my hair is thick and needs a lot of moisture, but this product can be a one-step curl routine for finer hair. I like it better than Deva Curl gel. It has better hold and does some special slip action that is very moisturizing and unique to the product. I also like the way it sculpts my curls a little bit more than the Deva gels. I love the definition I get from this product. Although you use a generous amount, I wouldn't load it on too thick, because it is fairly strong. You need to be kind of sparing when reapplying on second day hair--I would recommend not reapplying to the whole head. My only criticism is that it can create slightly more buildup than other lighter gels, like Deva. The smell is citrusy and lovely. The ingredients are VERY clean. Buy, buy, buy."

This custard leaves my hair soft and gives me defined curls to even the most stubborn strands of hair that just look frizzy. I've been applying it to wet hair, letting it dry for an hour, and then diffuse. I need to add just a tiny bit more after diffusing to tame flyaways, but that's it. I typically laugh at products that claim you need a quarter sized amount - that's such a load of garbage for anyone with longer, thick hair. But this stuff....you do not need a lot to go along way!

I've been trying the ""Curly girl"" method on my hair and this is one of the products that was recommended.  I use this on days that I skip shampoo.

This does not so it doesn't work if used alone for me. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I need the cast for my hair to hold up for 2nd or 3rd day hair. If it's too soft on 1st day hair, it wont hold up. HOWEVER, this product is still GREAT! It adds great definition to your curls and it is very forgiving if you use too much. If you like soft touch hold with defined curls, then this is for you. I actually combine it with another gel. I first use it on really damp hair as a ""primer"" and then finish off with the devacurl arc angel ultra hold gel. I don't have to use nearly as much devacurl gel and the combination of both products give me great definition. I will be purchasing it again."

I truly love it as a curl definer. My hair needs a bit more hold, i have 2C/3A fine hair so i add a bit of strong hold gell afterward. This really leaves curls defined and frizz free for the most part. I add a leave in light conditioner before Moptop custard and my day of curls come out really nice.I also love that this custard is free of silecones and other products that just sit on top of your hair. ++"

The very first time I washed with this shampoo, I noticed that large sections of my scalp were covered in flaking skin. This was mostly an issue around my crown and forehead area. It was the strangest thing; the flaking would begin immediately after use (noticeable even under wet hair) and continue to get worse for the day or two after washing. After the hair dried, it would begin to itch and continue to get itchier as time passed. I'm not sure if it was just dry flaky skin or if it was actual dandruff, but the amount of whatever it was was astonishing (and gross).I stopped using the shampoo after about a week, and my problems stopped then, but I've used it a couple of times since (when I was desperate and out of other shampoos) and had the same problem. It's super weird but I haven't heard of anyone else having the same issue. Other than that, it smelled good and did a fine job washing my actual hair, but I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else experiences something similar."

I received a sample of this custard and I love it so far! It made my 2C/3A curls even more curly!  I use a denman brush when I wash my hair, then I scrunch this into wet hair on top of homemade flax seed gel.  I only used a nickel sized amount on my thin hair which is just past my shoulders.  My curls were popping like never before!  It does have glycerin but it's winter now so it works great 4 me.  Not sure how well it will work in the humid summer because of the glycerin.I see some reviewers complained about this gel making their hair crunchy but keep in mind you're supposed to scrunch the hardness out of your hair in order to get soft curls.  Other reviewers complained of flaking but this wasn't an issue for me as i used on wet hair and did not mess with my curls after they dried and I ""scrunched out the crunch"".  Maybe ""scrunching out the crunch"" with some light oil would help with that?  Anyway, I give this stuff 2 thumbs up!"

It feels like that sugar body scrub you use.  I put some on my damp hair.  It will hold some of the curl in, but when it dries it turns hard like glue then starts to flake.  Compared to Ampro gel, which is much cheaper, I like Ampro better.  Ampro will smooth out my hair and make it straighter as it is holding it down.  Plus when it dries, it is not hard as glue, comes out easy and does not damage hair.  Ampro does very little flaking as well.  Back to that,"

Turns out it wasn‚Äôt for me. I like no-crunch custard and this leaves my hair dry, frizzy and crunchy.  And if I put it in my hair a little too much, it leaves some white flakes.

It glides through my curly hair nicely,"This conditioner is pretty good. It glides through my curly hair nicely, and helps keep the curl controlled as my hair dries.  Does not make my hair frizzy.  It smells nice, sweet like some kind of candy.  The reason for 2 stars is the bottle it comes in.  The product itself is pretty thick, like pudding.  It does not flow.  The plastic bottle it's in is thick hard plastic. It's ridiculously difficult to squeeze a thick, pudding-like product out of a narrow-necked stiff plastic bottle.  If you take the cap off you can ""shake"" it out, which is what I do, but it's not ideal considering that sometimes it shakes out a huge glob bigger than you need, which is a hassle again to scrape the excess back in.  The directions for use on the bottle state in bold letters, ""shake well"".  Lol, how do you shake this product well, especially when the bottle is brand new and filled to the top, and for what purpose?  Does the product separate as it sits it something.  No.  I just think there must be a lot of people in the company who don't understand the product or use it themselves.  The product would be better contained in a jar with a lid that you can dip your fingers into, or maybe a soft squeezable tube that can be stored upside down.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It doesn't seem like the manufacturer understands its own product. It's not exactly a bargain price either."

802,"ÔªøMopTop Gentle Shampoo, Natural Hair Moisturizer, Reduces Frizz, Color Safe Volumizing Shampoo - For All Hair Types, Straight, Curly, Wavy, Thin, Coily (8 oz)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprising Good!,"I bought these products after winning the travel sized kit and loving the daily conditioner.  I like the gentle shampoo because it cleaned my hair without stripping all the natural oils.  The deep conditioner didn't give me the same kind of slip for detangling as the the daily conditioner, but it did what it said it would do.  The leave it in conditioner gave my hair a light hold like a gel without the crunchy hardness of a gel.  It also left my hair soft and smooth.  I will for sure buy the leave it in conditioner and the gentle shampoo again.  I gave this review a 4 not 5 stars because the deep conditioner doesn't have the same slip as the daily conditioner.  The daily conditioner is the best conditioner for slip I have every used.  If you have frizzy curly hair these products are awesome.  It costs more, but these products are very high in and they work.  I have kinky curly hair and I love these products.  BTW it your hair is protein sensitive don't use the deep conditioner more then once a week."

I heard about on from CurlyPenny on YouTube and she swears by this stuff. I was hoping for a MIRACLE product that would really make all my curls extra defined and absolutely no frizz, but it's not working perfectly on my hair type. My hair is suuuuper thick, coarse, and I have a lot of it. It's curly/wavy but I know some little curls are hidden in there! The best method I found for me was to bring it with me in the shower, and after I rinse my conditioner out with cold water, I put a generous amount of this in my hair with my head upside down with a crunching motion. Try it! All in all I do love it and I may buy it again once I run out, unless I find something even better!"

Unless hair is extremely fine.This has lemon sage so I should have read that but I was drawn to the cute moptop name. Lemon sage is invigorating and cleansing. So great for oily hair or fine hair. It gave a little moisture but honestly not enough for me. I recommend if you have fine hair.I do not recommend  if you have wavy, curly, dry, course, colored (especially bleach) or grey hair. Its not a bad product  but it was really wrong for me and I had to rewash my hair with a deep moisture conditioner after using it."

There is no flaking and once it is dry it is very soft.  My big complaint is that it is so thick it takes FOREVER to dry.  I don't know if its just my hair - but it just clumps on and takes FOREVER to dry.  I have to wait until the next day to have hair that doesn't look wet.Once the bottle was 2/3 empty I added water - about 50/50 - and it is much better.  My hair actually looks dry the same day.I am still on the fence if I am going to purchase this again

It almost reminds me of Fruit Loops or some kind of Lemon cookie.. I always look forward to lathering it in my hair and relaxing to the smell of it, I only wish the great smell lingered longer after it dried (although I don't use it daily).While it's nourishing, I find that I have to use a lot more than the recommended amount in order to really saturate my hair and condition, otherwise my curls don't stay nice and tight like I like them to. So far, the best way that I've found to use it (for me, anyway) is to saturate my hair with the product in the shower and I won't even rinse it out. It does take longer to dry (I let my hair air dry), but it's worth it to not have to style my hair afterwards with a different product.This is my first use of a curly-girl-recommended product and so far I'm happy with the results :)"

I'm so happy to find it on ...,"I've been using MopTop for a while now, and I love it! I'm so happy to find it on Amazon instead of having to go to Whole Foods to get it. MopTop is gentle but gets the sweat and excess oil out of my hair from my daily workouts in hot, humid weather. I have long, fine, wavy/curly hair, and it looks great thanks to MopTop's line. For years, the back of my head used to itch after exercise, and I thought it was normal and caused by the salt in sweat. After using MopTop for a week or two, my head stopped itching. And my scalp doesn't get dry and flakey in the winter anymore. My daughter also uses the shampoo and Daily Conditioner on her long, straight, color-treated hair and loves it, which surprised me because she's a super picky brand snob who has zero interest in natural products. (With the shampoo, you can kind of tell it's a natural product because sometimes one of the ingredients settles in the bottom of the bottle. It's all the same color, but the bottom looks thicker or a different consistency. I stored the bottle upside down for a day to even it out again.) Anyway, this shampoo is the perfect mix of gentle but effective.After seeing noticeably better scalp and hair health with the shampoo and conditioner, I started using several products in the line, including the Curly Hair Custard, Leave In Conditioner, Hair Gel, Mongongo Oil and Clarifying Shampoo. I mix MopTop products with another brand of hair thickening cream (MopTop doesn't have one or I'd use it), and pick my hair cocktail depending on the day's weather. I always start with MopTop shampoo and conditioner, and I always get compliments on my hair! You definitely can't go wrong with this shampoo!"

I've used several hair gels in the past as part of the curly girl method, and this is by far my favorite. The gel itself has a nice citrus smell which doesn‚Äôt stay on my hair after I've applied it (too bad!). The gel is very comfortable to use. I apply it after the Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie, and also use a tiny bit to refresh the next day. It creates a cast, which I break after my hair becomes completely dry. It leaves my hair moisturized, and doesn‚Äôt weigh it down (which is very easy to do with 2a/2b waves). Having used this product for the last 6 months, I would highly recommend it."

Unless hair is extremely fine.This has lemon sage so I should have read that but I was drawn to the cute moptop name. Lemon sage is invigorating and cleansing. So great for oily hair or fine hair. It gave a little moisture but honestly not enough for me. I recommend if you have fine hair.I do not recommend  if you have wavy, curly, dry, course, colored (especially bleach) or grey hair. Its not a bad product  but it was really wrong for me and I had to rewash my hair with a deep moisture conditioner after using it."

There is no flaking and once it is dry it is very soft.  My big complaint is that it is so thick it takes FOREVER to dry.  I don't know if its just my hair - but it just clumps on and takes FOREVER to dry.  I have to wait until the next day to have hair that doesn't look wet.Once the bottle was 2/3 empty I added water - about 50/50 - and it is much better.  My hair actually looks dry the same day.I am still on the fence if I am going to purchase this again

It almost reminds me of Fruit Loops or some kind of Lemon cookie.. I always look forward to lathering it in my hair and relaxing to the smell of it, I only wish the great smell lingered longer after it dried (although I don't use it daily).While it's nourishing, I find that I have to use a lot more than the recommended amount in order to really saturate my hair and condition, otherwise my curls don't stay nice and tight like I like them to. So far, the best way that I've found to use it (for me, anyway) is to saturate my hair with the product in the shower and I won't even rinse it out. It does take longer to dry (I let my hair air dry), but it's worth it to not have to style my hair afterwards with a different product.This is my first use of a curly-girl-recommended product and so far I'm happy with the results :)"

I'm so happy to find it on ...,"I've been using MopTop for a while now, and I love it! I'm so happy to find it on Amazon instead of having to go to Whole Foods to get it. MopTop is gentle but gets the sweat and excess oil out of my hair from my daily workouts in hot, humid weather. I have long, fine, wavy/curly hair, and it looks great thanks to MopTop's line. For years, the back of my head used to itch after exercise, and I thought it was normal and caused by the salt in sweat. After using MopTop for a week or two, my head stopped itching. And my scalp doesn't get dry and flakey in the winter anymore. My daughter also uses the shampoo and Daily Conditioner on her long, straight, color-treated hair and loves it, which surprised me because she's a super picky brand snob who has zero interest in natural products. (With the shampoo, you can kind of tell it's a natural product because sometimes one of the ingredients settles in the bottom of the bottle. It's all the same color, but the bottom looks thicker or a different consistency. I stored the bottle upside down for a day to even it out again.) Anyway, this shampoo is the perfect mix of gentle but effective.After seeing noticeably better scalp and hair health with the shampoo and conditioner, I started using several products in the line, including the Curly Hair Custard, Leave In Conditioner, Hair Gel, Mongongo Oil and Clarifying Shampoo. I mix MopTop products with another brand of hair thickening cream (MopTop doesn't have one or I'd use it), and pick my hair cocktail depending on the day's weather. I always start with MopTop shampoo and conditioner, and I always get compliments on my hair! You definitely can't go wrong with this shampoo!"

I have searched for years (and I'm talking at least 30 years) for something that would work. It's not heavy, not greasy, and the best part was a trick I learned...it's truly ok to leave it in after you shampoo. That made all the difference in the world. I honestly get compliments every single day. Love the conditioner...but love the shampoo and the custard as well."

I recently stared wearing my hair natural and she used this MopTop gel on my hair when she cut and styled me the first time.  I am African American with shoulder length fine hair.

The slip was amazing and very few products actually tell you to leave some product in your hair instead of rinsing it all out.  This product costs more but you need to only use a little bit.  I mean like a quarter size will be enough for my whole head of hair.

I've used several hair gels in the past as part of the curly girl method, and this is by far my favorite. The gel itself has a nice citrus smell which doesn‚Äôt stay on my hair after I've applied it (too bad!). The gel is very comfortable to use. I apply it after the Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie, and also use a tiny bit to refresh the next day. It creates a cast, which I break after my hair becomes completely dry. It leaves my hair moisturized, and doesn‚Äôt weigh it down (which is very easy to do with 2a/2b waves). Having used this product for the last 6 months, I would highly recommend it."

0,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing results with just one wash!!!!,"After a summer filled with fun in the pool, my girls hair were feeling waxy & sticky. I couldn‚Äôt brush through their hair, or style their hair no matter what. I would try and brush their hair while braiding and the hair would stick to my hands and tangle while braiding. After speaking to my hair dresser I was on the hunt for clarifying shampoo. I‚Äôve tried a few in the past (high end salon products, MLM stuff & stuff you‚Äôd find at a pharmacy) , but have never been blown away with the results. This stuff though...It was like magic with just one wash. Hair is back to normal texture, and no more tangles or tears. I never leave reviews so for me to come in here and leave one it must be amazing."
1,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY happy to have my curls and clean hair back,"I am surprised how difficult it was to find a clarifying shampoo that I felt would really clean my hair, and I‚Äôm SO glad I found this one! For reference, I have fine, low porosity, low to medium density hair, so my hair gets buildup and gets weighed down super easily. I had tried a couple other ‚Äúclarifying‚Äù shampoos that just made my hair more gross because of the heavy moisturizing ingredients in them. The past few weeks before using this shampoo, my hair somehow was simultaneously greasy and dehydrated because it was blocked from absorbing moisture and everything was just sitting on the surface. This shampoo doesn‚Äôt have anything heavy in it as far as I can tell, and my hair was TRANSFORMED after using it. So so happy!"
2,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite for detox!,"I love this product. I only use it once every month to six weeks to detox my hair from gels and other products. I do the Curly Girl Method so I don't use products with harsh chemicals, but the natural oils and gels I use, do build up a little over time. This cleans my hair so well. Even though its a bit harsher (designed to be that way) for once a month detix shampooing, I love using it. For whatever reason my hair is always curliest after I use it. I figure over the month, the products do weigh my curls down a little."
3,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Funky,"This shampoo smells weird.  When I use it, I kind of feel as though I'm washing my hair with paint thinner.  If I've just shampooed with a clarifying shampoo, then this stuff also sudses pretty well -- a pleasant surprise, since most natural products (in my experience) don't.However, if I've been shampooing with this and conditioning with the MopTop conditioner (no other product of any kind -- no stylers, etc.), I get a lot of buildup, my hair feels gross, and it no longer sudses well.  I don't know if this is a result of the shampoo or the conditioner -- and I have very hard water, so if your water is soft, you might have better results -- but this was a fail for me."
4,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,I can‚Äôt recommend this enough,"I‚Äôve had issues with oily hair and itchy, painful, and flaky patches on my scalp for as long as I can remember.I tried this shampoo on a whim, hoping that this product would work out of the what feels like the millions I‚Äôve tried already. I wash my hair once a week due to sensitive skin and such. I used to was it and then the very next day it was so oily I felt gross. With this new shampoo, my hair doesn‚Äôt start getting greasy for a couple of DAYS, I feel like I can actually do things with my hair and go out and do things with my hair. I cant recommend this enough! If you‚Äôre looking for a reason to get this, do it!(I do have bleached and dyed hair, so it works great on that kind of hair too üíï)"
5,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Serious hair detox!,"This shampoo seems to be a serious detox.  I use it 1x 3-4 weeks or so.  I find that I need to heavily moisturize following usage.  I like this shampoo and using it with less frequency makes it a good $$ value.  I am a 2b curl, trying partial curlygirl methods."
6,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaky bottle üò¢,I could tell it smells really nice as soon as I opened the bubble mailer it arrived in because the bottle had leaked all over. I looked inside the bottle to find it at least half gone. There was not 1/2 bottle of product in the bubble mailer so where did it go??? I suspect I was ripped off. Unfortunately I‚Äôm having a hair emergency and really need to detox my hair/scalp so I‚Äôm not bothering with the return. It wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if the product wasn‚Äôt so ridiculously overpriced to begin with. But I literally got half of what I paid for.

9,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",3.0 out of 5 stars,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE For So Little,The quality of this product is a 5 star. I just think you can get the same results from Suave Clarifying which is only a few buck but you get 10 times as much as this teeny bottle.

A Little Goes a L O N G Way with Mop Top's Rescue Treatment!,"MopTop is a great hair care line. While it's geared towards curly girls, anyone can use it.

11,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a full bottle,"Just received the package.  Pulled the shrink wrap from the bottle, opened and there was no seal on the bottle and the bottle isn't even halfway full.  I'm guessing either someone took some for their own stash or the maker is selling a 'full size' bottle that is half full."

14,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,This shampoo removed all the product build up in my coily 3C hair.  It gently cleanses and enables the conditioner and other styling products to be absorbed by your hair.  Anyone with 3C hair knows that moisture is important for shine and healthy curls.  This product delivers and is amazing.  It does recommend not to use after freshly dyed hair.  Very happy with the results.

It also smells very good! I‚Äôve used it twice so far (30 days apart) and followed it up with a nice deep conditioner. It‚Äôs important to deep condition after using a clarifying shampoo to combat any dryness it may cause. My curls are defined, soft and shiny after I style it."

35,"MopTop Detox Shampoo for Fine, Thick, Wavy, Curly & Kinky-Coily Natural hair, made with Coconut, 2oz.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Does its job well,Does the job of a great clarifying shampoo but incredibly expensive for the amount of product you receive. However given that it‚Äôll probably only be used once a month it should last awhile. It‚Äôs not meant to be a daily shampoo and could be damaging if used that way
