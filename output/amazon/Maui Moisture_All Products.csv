0,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,UGHHh,"I had high hopes for this after seeing reviews of it on here and YouTube. I thought I had finally found a cheap natural hair product, but a girl was wrong...again. It did not help my hair at all. I could not detangle with it and it left my hair feeling brittle and lifeless. I have hair from type 2A to 4B and it did nothing for me. My cousins have 4B-4C hair and it only worked on one of them."
1,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just okay,"I've been making a point of buying only paraben free, sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for the past year. I wish I could say I've finally found a really hydrating conditioner with this one, but it just does a very average job for me. I still have to comb a TON of argon oil through my hair after showering for it to be soft and nice. I like other attributes of the conditioner, like the smell and such, but hydration is the whole point, and it's not doing it. Too bad! I'd previously been using Avalon Organics Nourishing Lavender. I find this to be about the same in effectiveness, just less costly.For reference, my hair is colored, but not too dry.Also - not related to effectiveness - but it's challenging that the shampoo and conditioner bottles look exactly the same. I find it funny that there's nothing visually distinguishable between them. Haven't mixed them up; just funny."
2,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Literally my favorite brand,"I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this brand is. Aloe as the first ingredient is the most amazing thing you can have in a skin or haircare product. Add to the fact they have coconut water in it too, and it's f over! And no silicone, sulfates, or parabens? Please! This could smell like toilet water and I'd buy it and mask it, but luckily all of their products truly smell like Maui; words don't do it justice, but it smells how having tropical sun kissed skin feels.Dramatics aside, you simply will not find a product (body wash, shampoo, or anything) better than they have for a better price. Not with the ingredient concentration and quality for sure. I look hella too like I'm obsessed- I actually have really bad (diagnosed) OCD.I literally never write reviews but I literally have like 5 of their products and am obsessed with getting more (I always have some waiting in my cart to get when I have extra money- right now I have 2) cause they're so good. I've been using really good products for awhile now and you can genuinely feel the quality and moisture in the consistency like this stuff is really good. Their body wash is exquisitely moisturizing and nourishing(and I got volcanic ash-the harshest one- and I mix it with a bha/aha wash that I v drying) and its the only body wash I've ever used where the smell actually lingers ON YOUR SKIN!!!I recommend this brand enthusiastically to all my friends and family, and I recommend it to anyone. Clearly get the right product for you, but this brand, and their base formula, is good for anyone and everyone."
3,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I found this shampoo and conditioner by chance in a store and love, love, love it! I have noticed that my split ends have decreased since using it. So happy that I stumbled up this brand."
4,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,HOLY GRAIL - Low porosity hair life saver!!!!,"I've tried so many products from Olaplex to every natural/sulfate free shampoo and conditioner to mend my super dry low porosity hair (I don't color, I barely use heat, but my ends get so dry and have breakage from previous keratin treatments) and within ONE wash - my hair literally went from feeling dead and dry from the neck down to being the softest and healthiest my hair has ever felt all the way down to my ends!!! It has so much life and movement - all the dryness and frizz are GONE. Literally can't believe the results for the price, it feels like my hair went through a $200 conditioning treatment I'm obsessed!!!!"
5,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful and doesn’t condition the hair at all,This is the worst waste of money. It is worse than putting soap in your hair. It is completely worthless and useless. This is the worst conditioner that I have ever used. It is not like conditioner at all. You may as well put soap in your hair. This so-called conditioner does not do anything to condition the hair. It leaves your hair dry and a mess. Your hair will be dryer and have knots after using this.
6,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing detangler for dry , coarse , ethnic hair.","This is an excellent moisturizer. You’ll notice, it softens and detangles at the same time with the added bonus of smelling just amazing. I have long , natural , ethnic , thick hair that tends to dry out due to intense workouts , resulting in a lot of sweating and this has worked really well (a game changer) . After normal product use, my hair feels silky; I can literally comb through my thick hair with only my hands because it detangles and softens very well. I would highly recommend sectioning your hair and applying this product according to the instructions. I saw an immediate difference in the natural texture of my hair and couldn’t be happier. Big bonus: not greasy and no residue.Tip:Use in shower after washing your hair. Put this product on liberally , in sections , leave on about 2 minutes to let it work it’s magic, rinse out and enjoy the benefits. My hair is the driest around my nap so I apply liberally in my nap and hairline .  This clears the kinks. This is a thick product so turn the bottle upside down before using; it’s not watery so you may have to shake the bottle to get the product out.I learned of this product reading multiple reviews online , saw that it was sold on amazon and picked up 2 bottles. This is a staple in my house."
7,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally found the perfect shampoo and conditioner,"I've been using this shampoo and conditioner for 3 months now, and I can finally say I've found what I've been looking for.My whole life, I've had super thick, coarse, kinky, dry hair that basically feels like you're brushing hay. That may be in part due to PCOS and some hormone imbalances caused by that, and I've tried all kinds of products over the years to make it feel even remotely moisturized. Everything either didn't improve the feel of my hair, cost WAY too much, or left my hair feeling greasy.Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate made my hair feel smooth and look shiny for the first time ever...while leaving it feeling light and fluffy. Yay no grease! I feel like I got a salon product at an actual reasonable price. Highly recommend."
8,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't hesitate,"I had been using Tresemme shampoo and cheap conditioner for a while now and it's done nothing but damage my hair and leave residue. This is the first all natural product I've used and I'm in love!!! I paired this with the matching shampoo and the vanilla bean hair mask. I shampooed and then conditioned allowing it to sit for 10 minutes then rinsed, when I got out of the shower I used the mask as a leave- in product using a small amount on my damp hair. I allowed my hair to dry naturally. I have not seen my natural waves in months!!!! After just one use my hair feels like it's coming back to life. This is my new go too!!!!"
9,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"I've gone back and forth with so many different products for my dry and damaged hair and none of them gave me the results that this brand did! I bought the conditioner as well and it has made a huge difference. My hair is still dry, but definitely not as bad as it was. My frizz is pretty much gone, and my natural waves and curls have become so much more pronounced. I used to straighten my hair all of the time because I didn't like how my waves/curls looked, and now I don't straighten my hair! You end up only needing so little of this stuff to help your hair, it's amazing. I love the coconut scent, and my hair always feels so healthy after a wash. I highly recommend buying the conditioner with it for the best results. Will absolutely continue buying this when it comes time for more."
10,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Heal and Hydrate line,I love the Heal and Hydrate shampoo and leave in conditioner! My hair is very long and fine in texture.  So many moisturizing products weigh my hair down but not these. They do a great job. When my hair was a lot shorter I really liked the heal and hydrate conditioner and mask but i find now that my hair is very long they don't quite add as much moisture as I need.  I use another brand's hair mask instead to condition after shampooing now. But the shampoo and leave in are holy grail status for me. Not a fan of any of the other Maui Moisture lines I have tried but the heal and hydrate are amazing.
11,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally got it RIGHT!,"My teen daughter is so picky about her hair products!!  She has ""mixed"" hair and it is very thick and curly.  She is very scent sensitive and very difficult to purchase anything for!  I took a chance and she is in LOVE with this.  The scent is light but pleasing.  Her curls are soft and shiny, very manageable!  She hates a stiff or a thick product and this is neither.  She was actually impressed I picked this out!  Definitely recommend!"
12,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe it's the formula,"I have bought and used Maui products before and had no problem with them doing what they say they do. My issue with this Maui product is that the smell is really strong almost like the product has been doused in alcohol and perfume strong. For a minute I thought maybe the seller did something to my product(product came unsealed) and that was the cause of the smell. I don't remember Maui smelling so loud. Overall, as I stated the product did do what it stated but the smell is strong."
13,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,This is not Maui Moisture!,BUYER BEWARE whatever is inside this bottle is not the correct product! I buy this at my grocery store as needed but due to the pandemic I decided to purchase on Amazon and save myself a trip. I know exactly what this scent should smell and feel like. The product inside the bottle smells and looks nothing like it should. I will never buy things like this from Amazon again. Too easily switched out for cheap knock-off products!
14,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected....,This is a great product but I was not fond of how it left my hair. I think it cleaned it too much and left my hair without moisture for me to feel its essence look I was expecting of this product. It is highly wonderfully scented with wonderful aromas it is to embrace and be mentally transported in sweet lands but for me does not do the job I was hoping for.
15,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,A thick conditioner that smells amazing,"This shampoo is very moisture rich. For me, this isn’t the best for a shampoo because it makes my scalp oily pretty quickly. I will still use it because it smells so good! I like the conditioner better because it has the same smell. The conditioner is thick and it feels like it penetrates the hair better than lighter conditioners. I prefer the conditioner over the shampoo and I think the price is good for the quality of then product. I prefer this scent and product the most from this brand. However, I really do not like the deep conditioning masque in this same scent. It is terrible and makes my hair feel like I put something extremely cheap on my hair"
16,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works amazing!,"I love this and use it every time I shower. It has a great scent and really moisturizes my hair. I have curly hair, so it tends to be pretty dry. Not many conditioners make my hair look and feel this great!! The only problem is that it is hard to get out of the container. I just leave it upside down and that seems to work!"
17,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair falling out!!,"I’m pretty positive this is making my hair shed, (falling out to the touch of anything. ) I have pretty thin hair and I just used this and bam my hair is shedding like NEVER before. Never. My husband too! And I’m pretty sure it’s making my face break out too from when my hair touches my face. I don’t think this is as great a product as it tries to come off as. Sadly."
18,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It dried out my hair even more than normal making it more brittle and frizzy,"Update:I tried using it at different amounts of product I used but the results were nearly the same with end result that my hair completely dried out and it took couple of weeks to restore my hair to natural state.I do not recommend this product.First impression:Smells good, it's nice and thick creamy."
19,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good product,Used both conditioner and shampoo and it Made my hair feel hard and difficult to clear out. My hair didn’t feel moisturized. Not worth the buy
20,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Lives up to the hype,Loved this product. Great conditioner and detangler. Takes away all the frizz and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth. The scent is wonderful. Can’t say enough good things about this product.
21,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,HATED this,"I was very excited to use this, I have straight hair, not damaged, just wanted to use a good shampoo, I read a lot of opinions and reviews and it seemed this was the best shot, the first time I used it I didn't understand why my hair was drying so bad, really really dry, horrible. I decided to give it another shot and it was the same thing, my hair was horrible after, I also used the shampoo of the same brand. I'm never using them again. I went back to my regular drugstore Dove and my hair is perfect."
22,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle is difficult to squeeze,"I’m not too fond of the scent (personal preference) but it’s a nice formula that doesn’t dry/dehydrate. The bottle design leaves a lot to be desired. It’s impossible to squeeze so you have to shake the product out, like ketchup."
23,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny curls! Good leave in spray option for non-greasy finish,"Made my curls so shiny! Not very soft or overly greasy but I like that. I do not pick up on a very strong scent, but I prefer that. Scented products clash with perfume. Good price for a leave in spray conditioner- will buy again."
24,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Prepare to rinse for a while.,"Overall, this is a great conditioner. It smells amazing and feels really hydrating. My only issue is that, because it’s a thicker consistency, I feel like I have to stay under the shower head forever and a day to rinse all the conditioner off. Otherwise my hair feels thick, gross, and dirty. It’s not the worst problem to have but it is something to keep in mind."
25,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware!! Not Actual Product!,I buy and use this product regularly from the store and a few times on Amazon. The most recent one I bought from Amazon is NOT the real product! The consistency and smell were the first things I noticed were off. Each time I've used it my hair has been dry and frizzy and hard to brush. It looks awful! I love this conditioner but I will never buy this from Amazon again!
26,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair loss. Do not buy!!,I have lost an insane amount of hair since I started using this product.
27,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It actually works!,I finally found a spray conditioner that does what it is supposed to do.

28,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,meh...,"I had heard amazing things about the shampoo and conditioner duo. my hair has been very dry and dull lately so i thought this would help. unfortunately the results were underwhelming, my hair remained dull, dry and rough. was hoping for a better outcome will have to continue the search for a better product."
29,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work,"I only used this conditioner 2 times and both times it left my hair in one large tangled mess and dried my hair out so bad I would not use for a 3rd time.  There was nothing moisturizing about this product. Save your money and buy anything else. Beware if you are having hair loss, it make it worst."
30,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the smell!,"I love the smell of this, and moisturizes my hair better than most other products I've tried!

I’m so sad I didn’t try it sooner. I’ve been using high end color protecting shampoo for years , I took the plunge and cut my color off so I got this to use after my clarifying shampoo.

33,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Aloe!,Love that the primary ingredient is aloe juice.

41,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a no for me,"I purchased based on the positive reviews, affordability and “natural” ingredients, but maybe it wasn’t meant for my hair type. It left my hair feeling dull, limp and dirty, as if I never gave my hair a good rinse. It actually did the opposite and made my hair even frizzier and harder to detangle. It smells really good! But the smell can be very overpowering and too perfumey. Disappointed in this product."

While the smell is kinda strong but smells good, this shampoo absolutely dried out my hair. There was NO moisturizing effect at all.

Going back to function of beauty and paying the extra price so my hair doesn’t die."

I normally use dove or tressame. Anyways this is the best I have used yet. Let’s just say my hair doesn’t fall out in the shower nor while combing it as much. I use it almost everyday. My hair is very curly and fine and this stuff makes a world of difference. My hair stays hydrated all day with the hair mask and the shampoo and conditioner makes it very soft.

244,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Meh, just okay; it's not bad but it isn't  amazing, either","I have used Maui Moist shampoos and conditioners for several months now. Maybe it's because my hair is so dry and curly ( as in telephone-cord curly), but in my experience, while this brand's shampoos and conditioners certainly do smell nice and are at least as good as any drugstore or supermarket- issued shampoo and conditioner, but I don't find this brand to be all that special in terms of  moisturizing unless I squirt a bunch of argan  oil or coconut oil into the bottle, which I  really shouldn't have to do if this product really did do what is purports to do, right? I mean, it's pretty good and it didn't dry out my scalp or make my hair spontaneously combust  or  fall out or anything drastic like that, and the smell is delicious enough that it keeps me coming back to the brand to buy more, so it certainly isn't terrible or anything, I  just think it should do a better job of moisturizing my hair.  Buying tip for any  savings-minded readers like me: I have only purchased the shampoo and conditioner on Amazon once; once in a local store in my little tiny  hometown in Michigan ; and  once  on eBay, and while it isn't cheap ( remember, this isn't some detergent-laden cheapie  shampoo like Pert or Suave or  whatever); it isn't really expensive, either (I once had a $40 shampoo-- it WAS amazing-- from Italy that I bought from a local  salon  here in Atlanta, but they are always out of it, and that is way out of my budget right now anyway. I found this brand  to cost less on eBay when bought as a shampoo/conditioner set, but of course, shipping with amazon prime is quicker and somewhat cheaper to ship than what one might find on eBay. So this isn't a bad deal, it actually is quite a bit better than buying it at a box store if you can find it (my local Target in Atlanta didn't even carry  this brand when  I  last visited there and wanted to stock up).So I'm back to buying it on Amazon, because I am running low on it and I'm going to want it sooner than later."
245,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT for dry hair!,"I was searching for a ""better"" conditioner since I had JUST cut 2 inches off of my hair 6 weeks ago and it was ALREADY looking fried and dried despite not using any styling tools. I walked down the aisle at Walmart and realized that the conditioners all had water as the first ingredient and some type of alcohol as the second....even as I continued into the more and more expensive brands, they still had alcohol as the second ingredient! I determined that I would find SOMETHING without that drying alcohol ingredient (at least so far near the front) and came upon this.I paid $6.50 for each bottle (I got shampoo, conditioner and the spray oil) hoping for the best but not expecting much. In full disclosure, I also bought Ultra-Swim shampoo to get a good clarifying cleanse before starting this since google searching told me that switching from sulfates to natural cleansers takes a bit of an adjustment that I wanted to avoid (and supposedly my city water has chlorine added so I figured it couldn't hurt to use this stuff.) I did have to shampoo with that Ultra-Swim about 3 times in a row before getting a good suds worked up, but then I got a great suds from this shampoo and realized to my amazement that I could actually run my fingers through my hair during this shampoo stage! Normally I shampoo up, rinse it out, then condition and run my fingers through it to get all the loose hair out--I simply can't run my fingers through UNTIL adding conditioner. Not with this! I was running my fingers through it and through it and through it, amazed at the feeling! The conditioner was just as ""luxurious""...there's no other word for it!I have since washed with just these 2 and I don't get the VAST amount of suds from that first wash, but that's not surprising...I probably would if I shampooed 3 times like I did that first time (but it's not necessary now.) I still get a lot of suds and that conditioned feeling, though. I MIGHT could go without the conditioner and use only the moisturizing shampoo, but my hair is super dry so I won't even try. I haven't had any adjustment period to this (again, could be because of the Ultra-Swim clarification?) What REALLY got me was that google-searching mentioned scratching your head and getting ""dead skin cells"" under your nails (which I totally did) but then they said it was actually the sulfates left over...and sure enough, I don't get that under my nails now! I love this stuff!!!! And I only wash my hair every 3 days, so it will last me a LONG time! I even brought some travel sizes to work to share with a couple of friends, and they're in love, too! But if you don't have dry hair, this is NOT the product for you!"
246,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I would pass,"I tried this set, including the deep conditioner and at first I fell in love.  After many uses of the same bottle, however, I all of a sudden noticed my hair was super tangly and dry and brittle.  I’ve never felt my hair this way before.  I can say in this time, the only changes that I made while I started using this product is less heat and using oils/ creams with no alcohol, so I feel strongly this set is what caused my hair to be so damaged.  Also, I have naturally curly hair that I chemically straighten to give you an idea of my hair type.  Lastly, after following them on Instagram, it looks like this product is a bit controversial as some of their chemicals contain formeldehyde releasers, which is super scary in itself.  Unfortunately, I will no longer be using."
247,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,4C/Kinky/coiled/black girl hair,"Review geared to African american females. It does 30% of the job. You can't move around yourhair too much because you'll find it harder to detangle. You have to work your way in around the hair. This conditioner works best in one method: parting your hair into smaller sections, next quickly applying and combing through right away, and leaving conditioner to sit for 2-5 minutes (the longer the better) for softening. Finally a second rinse while gently rinsing hands through hair. It makes your hair stiff if you wash away quickly. Not a product i recommend if you don't have the patience to see best results which isnt much"
248,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!,"I've only used Tresemme Keratin Smooth since it came out I decided to try this and I'm officially in love with Maui. My hair is so soft and the smell is amazing. I finished by using the Maui Coconut oil mist.. again smells amazing and my hair looks and feels healthy. I have long, extremely thick hair.. I've read that switching to sulfate free is like putting your hair thru detox bc of all the chemicals that are in regular shampoo.. Might take a few weeks before getting the full affect of this shampoo bc of how damaged my hair is but so far so good. I love this. Ordered the Vanilla also.. can't wait to try that one!!! Highly recommended.. just give it a chance!!!"

250,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Scalp itch and rash!,"I've tried the other version made with Bamboo which was great, this one however, do not purchase. At least I won't for myself. After a few days I started to notice an itch on my scalp, which later progressed into a rash, almost like burn marks on my scalp. Not fun! Will not be purchasing this again. It also failed when it came to moisturizing my hair, it left its dry, tangled, and lots of breakage."
251,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible. Don’t buy.,"I rarely write reviews and rarely try something that actually makes my hair worse, but this did. Buyer beware. It makes your hair soft and silky for first few uses and then, bam! Your hair is a crinkly rays nest. No. No. No. keep scrolling.... I wouldn’t use this again if you paid me, so the low price is not worth the damage to your hair."
252,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome products,I use this whole line and for me the shea butter products are the winners. I have very dry hair and live in the southwest where the summers are brutal on hair. Before it was breaking off alot and so brittle that I couldn't brush or comb it. Immediately after trying this line my hair revived itself and started looking and feeling great. I highly recommend it and I will keep on buying it (threw out all the others).
253,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this,Love this shampoo and conditioner

Though the mask is not very good. I found it greasy and drying. But shampoo and conditioner are great. Stick with conditioner over the mask.
255,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells wonderful, thick consistency","Purchased and used in combination with the shampoo. Smells wonderful, thick consistency, but made my dense fine hair SO staticky! Quit use after about a week of use and went back to my previous brand. Normally wouldn't quit mid-bottle but couldn't stand the static! Agree with other reviews, best thing is the smell but not worth the static and dryness."

259,"Maui Moisture Frizz-Free + Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Mist, Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Such a HUGE disappointment and a total waste of money,"Such a HUGE disappointment and a total waste of money! I bought both the shampoo and conditioner. After the first and final use, it took me an hour to comb through my tangled hair, enough that I could blow dry it.This product made my hair so dry ( almost crunchy), but oily looking, limp, and FULL of STATIC; that I threw away both the shampoo and conditioner after the first use! The only things that are nice about this product are the smell and the advertising. The labels look cool; chemical free this, that, and the other, but the shampoo and conditioner produce awful results! Don't waste your money! Johnson &Johnson baby shampoo makes your hair so super soft, that my son, our Labrador, and I, all use that shampoo and it is fantastic! Don't waste your money on this product, neither the shampoo nor the conditioner! That's what I think anyway."

0,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Detoxifying Shampoo,"I was looking for a more clarifying/detoxifying shampoo to add into my wash routine to get rid of product buildup and congestion. This does the job well and is very affordable! Not sure why some reviews say the smell is bad? The one I received smelled as expected based on the ingredients. I would have rather have that than intense floral fragrances which can be irritating. Also saw reviews that said this can be drying. I would not recommend using this as your sole shampoo, or using it everyday. I have curly hair, and wash my hair around 2-3 times a week. I use this once a week and alternate with a hydrating shampoo. The two together help balance my hair."
1,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,completely dried out my hair and smells too weird,"I never originally had dry hair to buy this particular one but bought it for the ""congested"" aspect (to see if it'd help dandruff caused by excess oily hair) but this dried it out of any sort of moisture my hair could produce.I have curly hair, (3b-3c) and by the next morning, my hair would frizz to the point where there's wasn't a single discernable curl, something that has never happened before...this happened with my first and second use, by the second time I knew it was the product- not me.I'll be fixing this damage with their other product that does work wonders on me, the orange bottled for ""thick and curly"" one.Hopefully, those who have my hair type see this before buying! it's truly terribleUpdate: looked up the Devacurl lawsuit which made me wary and looked up Maui moisture on “think dirty” and this scored a red 8, bad...so I’ll just be switching brands. The experience with this shampoo was just a bit too peculiar for me"
2,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Softness and Squeeky clean!,"I hesitated on this shampoo, read the reviews and thought the price was decent so why not? It truly does get rid of all the residue left in your hair- My hair smelled great and made it soft! I personally needed conditioner, and I could feel in the shower that I absolutely needed conditioner. I just ordered Maui conditioner! I will buy this product again."
3,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,SUPER oily hair,I have EXTREMELY oily hair that can look like I haven’t washed it in days by noon. I have been looking for sulfate and paraben free shampoo options. I came across this after my mom used a few other shampoos from Maui moisture and loved them. This shampoo makes my hair look so clean and shiny! My mom has thick course curly hair and also tried it for her “detox” day and loves it as well! Needless to say this is an EXCELLENT shampoo!
4,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Intense Perfume smell,"I wouldn't say the odor is from the ingredients as the shampoo's scent is VERY strong and on the perfume-y side of smells -- it isn't a dark shampoo, if you are expecting the charcoal to turn the product dark grey, it's not -- there is a hint of charcoal in it -- as it isn't totally translucent, but I doubt there is enough in it to do anything, -- ended up throwing it away, mostly couldn't stand the odor (which of course lingers strongly in your hair"
5,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very great product!!!,I really liked this product! I have been struggling with product buildup for months now and this product left not only my scalp but my hair feeling great. Coming from a 3c/4a hair texture it’s a must if you’ve been trying to get a detox going. If you’re a natural hair beauty who doesn’t like strong fragrance in their products I ought to say stay away from this!
6,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The quantity has been reduced.,"I won’t purchase from Maui anymore. You can rise your price if you want to, but why reduce the quantity of it? Before when I purchased the same item in target, the bottle was full; when I started purchased thru Amazon, I can feel the bottle is getting lighter and lighter, more and more air and empty space in it. Not gonna take it anymore, won’t purchase again and will search another brand."
7,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Probably fake,I have use this exact shampoo for several months but the bottle that was shipped to me smelled so bad that I threw in the garbage.
8,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite shampoo of all time,"I don't say this lightly, this is the best shampoo I have ever used. I have used it for a few years now and nothing else compares, even expensive brands. It doesn't cause build-up and leaves my hair so shiny. It lathers well and I like that the first ingredient is aloe so I feel like I'm paying for real stuff instead of just water. I *highly* recommend!"
9,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just get it,Used at a friends house and fell in love on the first use. Love the smell!

16,"Maui Moisture Moisture Detoxifying + Volcanic Ash Conditioner - black , 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall great product.,I love this product. My one draw back is that is does not double as a leave-in as do so many of the newer maui masks that provide dual versitility.

0,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying Volcanic Ash Scalp Care Mask, Coconut, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Detoxifying Shampoo,"I was looking for a more clarifying/detoxifying shampoo to add into my wash routine to get rid of product buildup and congestion. This does the job well and is very affordable! Not sure why some reviews say the smell is bad? The one I received smelled as expected based on the ingredients. I would have rather have that than intense floral fragrances which can be irritating. Also saw reviews that said this can be drying. I would not recommend using this as your sole shampoo, or using it everyday. I have curly hair, and wash my hair around 2-3 times a week. I use this once a week and alternate with a hydrating shampoo. The two together help balance my hair."

5,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying Volcanic Ash Scalp Care Mask, Coconut, 12 Ounce",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very great product!!!,I really liked this product! I have been struggling with product buildup for months now and this product left not only my scalp but my hair feeling great. Coming from a 3c/4a hair texture it’s a must if you’ve been trying to get a detox going. If you’re a natural hair beauty who doesn’t like strong fragrance in their products I ought to say stay away from this!
6,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying Volcanic Ash Scalp Care Mask, Coconut, 12 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,The quantity has been reduced.,"I won’t purchase from Maui anymore. You can rise your price if you want to, but why reduce the quantity of it? Before when I purchased the same item in target, the bottle was full; when I started purchased thru Amazon, I can feel the bottle is getting lighter and lighter, more and more air and empty space in it. Not gonna take it anymore, won’t purchase again and will search another brand."
7,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying Volcanic Ash Scalp Care Mask, Coconut, 12 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Probably fake,I have use this exact shampoo for several months but the bottle that was shipped to me smelled so bad that I threw in the garbage.
8,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying Volcanic Ash Scalp Care Mask, Coconut, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite shampoo of all time,"I don't say this lightly, this is the best shampoo I have ever used. I have used it for a few years now and nothing else compares, even expensive brands. It doesn't cause build-up and leaves my hair so shiny. It lathers well and I like that the first ingredient is aloe so I feel like I'm paying for real stuff instead of just water. I *highly* recommend!"
9,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying Volcanic Ash Scalp Care Mask, Coconut, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just get it,Used at a friends house and fell in love on the first use. Love the smell!

15,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying Volcanic Ash Scalp Care Mask, Coconut, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on hubby dandruff!,This has worked better than head and shoulders or all the others he has tried.  He has black/ gray hair.  Part American Indian.  I don't know if that matters on giving a review but I like to know who is leaving it.  I order 3 bottles at a time.  He has used for over a year now.

16,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying Volcanic Ash Scalp Care Mask, Coconut, 12 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall great product.,I love this product. My one draw back is that is does not double as a leave-in as do so many of the newer maui masks that provide dual versitility.

5,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very great product!!!,I really liked this product! I have been struggling with product buildup for months now and this product left not only my scalp but my hair feeling great. Coming from a 3c/4a hair texture it’s a must if you’ve been trying to get a detox going. If you’re a natural hair beauty who doesn’t like strong fragrance in their products I ought to say stay away from this!
6,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The quantity has been reduced.,"I won’t purchase from Maui anymore. You can rise your price if you want to, but why reduce the quantity of it? Before when I purchased the same item in target, the bottle was full; when I started purchased thru Amazon, I can feel the bottle is getting lighter and lighter, more and more air and empty space in it. Not gonna take it anymore, won’t purchase again and will search another brand."
7,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Probably fake,I have use this exact shampoo for several months but the bottle that was shipped to me smelled so bad that I threw in the garbage.
8,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite shampoo of all time,"I don't say this lightly, this is the best shampoo I have ever used. I have used it for a few years now and nothing else compares, even expensive brands. It doesn't cause build-up and leaves my hair so shiny. It lathers well and I like that the first ingredient is aloe so I feel like I'm paying for real stuff instead of just water. I *highly* recommend!"
9,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just get it,Used at a friends house and fell in love on the first use. Love the smell! My hair is so soft even if I just use the shampoo and thats scary to admit cuz I MUST have conditioner with my fine hair.
10,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Price,My daughter like using this shampoo. It is hard to find it in the store. But amazon all ways has it. Great buy as well
11,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too fragrant,Such a strong smell!!  Not expected from a product that is supposedly free of all the bad stuff.  Fragrance is overpowering.

15,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on hubby dandruff!,This has worked better than head and shoulders or all the others he has tried.  He has black/ gray hair.  Part American Indian.  I don't know if that matters on giving a review but I like to know who is leaving it.  I order 3 bottles at a time.  He has used for over a year now.

16,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall great product.,I love this product. My one draw back is that is does not double as a leave-in as do so many of the newer maui masks that provide dual versitility.
17,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente,Super buen producto ayuda a la limpieza profunda del cabello.. con un olor muy agradable
18,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me...didn’t leave hair feeling healthy.,I’ve used WEN for over a decade... thought I’d change it up.

63,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Oily scalp,"This works wonders. I tend to have an oily scalp and all the other hair masks make that worse. This mask didn’t leave any residue or film feeling. My scalp felt purified and my hair strands felt very soft. After the second or third time using I noticed my hair/scalp didn’t get oily as fast as it used to, where as before i had to wash my hair every other day. Now i can go 2/3 days without a wash. I would definitely recommend"
64,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I have FINALLY found the perfect product and I'm in love! I've been using both the volcanic ash shampoo and conditioner together, and my hair is so soft and easy to comb through. It doesn't make my hair greasy quickly like some other products do, and my hair smells amazing. Maui Moisture has everything I look for in a product, so I first thought it was too good to be true. I've been using it for a month and I still love it! It also doesn't require much per use so I know it's going to last a while. I have nothing bad to say about this product and I 10/10 recommend!"
65,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price!,My husband brought home a bottle from work cause one of the bands left it in the shower. My son has an extremely dry scalp but really oily hair. This shampoo gets his hair really clean and his scalp isn't dried out. He can go 2-3 days between washes and his scalp never itches. It is a godsend.
66,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The most important thing about this product was the way it made my hair feel and look .,"After using this shampoo I notice a pretty scent in the air and realized it was my hair from this shampoo . then when my hair dryer my hair looked and felt fuller , and the textureof my hair was amazing soft and silky and I was hooked !

68,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great products,I love all of the Maui products they work great in your hair. Not oily  is going instantly into your hair you can see the difference
69,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"My suggestion, is to buy every single product this company has to offer as far as body and hair care",This stuff is absolutely fabulous. It makes your hair feel like silk. My hair tends to be a little on the dry frizzy side and this takes care of it all. I have bought every single one of their products that they offer. Don’t hesitate to buy.
70,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture Rich!,Bought this product to help my husband with his extremely dry scalp- we were even thinking it could be eczema!

72,"Maui Moisture Detoxifying + Shampoo, Volcanic Ash, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing conditioner!,My favorite conditioner! Smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.

0,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Massive hair loss,"My hair has been thinning out for years after my second (and last) pregnancy. After countless vitamins and products, I have gotten used to it but still managed to conserve a decent amount of hair on my head. Actually, I could say it was improving a bit before I started using Maui Moisture products. I only own three products from this brand (this gel, the shampoo, and a leave-in or rinse-out mask). I thought I had found the perfect gel for my dry, thin, frizzy tresses only to find massive hair loss after a few uses instead. I stopped using as of my last wash and hopefully regrow a few hairs after a while :("
1,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My newest obsession in styling products,"I am in love with this product. It’s misleading calling it gel because it doesn’t make your hair crunchy or frizzy like gel does. As it dries (and depending how much is used) it may give a slight soft crunchy feel but just run your fingers thru it or shake it out. It’s amazing how soft it stays without becoming frizzy. The scent is pleasant, not too strong but it dissipates quickly so it’s not an issue."
2,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Stuff!,"Good moisturizer and creates curls that hold.  This is a pic on the morning after I used it the previous morning, and basically, it’s a bed head photo.  Still the curls are holding.  It’s a very lightweight gel that dries quickly.  Personally, I could use a bit more scent, but that’s a workaround.  I’m certainly going to stock up and try other Maui products."
3,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Madly in love with this product, good for 2b-3a curls","I’ve been using Maui Moisture conditioner and shampoo lines for a couple of years now (curly girl method = no ‘cones or sulfates), but this is the first time I’ve used this curl gel. I bought the mousse at the same time and used it a few times before giving this gel a try today. The mousse was fine but a bit light for my hair. It looked soft and a bit flat and frizzy. I read this Curl Quench was heavier/thicker and today was a shampoo day so I decided “what the heck.” It took a while to dry, but once I scrunched out the casts — holy smokes! My curls are a mix of 2b, 2c, and 3a, and now my new gray parts are so loose they’re practically in the 1 category. It looks like this Curl Quench is even getting those straighter gray spots to behave themselves. Since today was a shampoo day, my hair was already a bit ""lighter/drier"" than usual. I can't wait to see how my curls react tomorrow!Curly friends with thicker hair, especially curls that misbehave: this might be your product!The first two photos are right after I scrunched (casts were still a tiny bit damp). The third photo was about 10 hours later to show how the curls fluffed out. Tomorrow I'm going to be a lot more careful how I twist to make sure the curl pattern is better -- there were some crazy pieces, but I think that was me being sloppy when it was still wet. I'm not used to ""super hold.""*Update* I discovered a slight downside: this product really doesn’t rinse out very well and so there is buildup after a few days (I have to re-wet my curls every morning). An extra shampoo day every week is still worth the curls I get with this gel."
4,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best gel for curly hair ever!!!,"I'm addicted to this stuff. I have a product graveyard under my sink and think I've tried everything out there. This gel is amazing! I feel like I need to stockpile it in case they ever go out of production. For reference- my hair is thick, curly and color treated. I love the Maui curl quench!"
5,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,So far real good,I have thick curly hair I have tried in the past two weeks about 10 different gelsThis one is the winner so farNot greasy the smell isGood not over powering would buy again
6,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's just ok,"Took synthetic brand new hair and added it to never wet down no product hair It doesn't flake when you comb thru with fingers.  Helps hold very lightly a d helps frizz quite a bit.we will see after a days wear how it works.  If you want a daily light hold product for synthetic hair that doesnt flake nor frizz, this is a viable option. Have to use alot and not good for price."
7,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,No friz,"This has quickly become a staple in my bathroom.  I have curly frizzy hair and this smells great and contains the friz without a wet look like gel.  End results are natural wavy/curls, no friz!"
8,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Just not for me,This was just not for me but it may be for you but based on my experience I used it once did not like the scent did not like the texture didn’t really do anything for my curls so I gave it away… This was mine and my only experience to be fair it may work well for you
9,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It works!,"It works! It adds a nice hold to your curls without the residue and crunchy feeling. But, I wouldn’t recommend you use as much or daily. And, I do notice after a few days  I’ll need to cowash or rinse out my hair completely to reapply for the results  I want"
10,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Only good for one day,"This product is fine on the first day but it does not hold enough for me to wear a second day. It stays crunchy if put on dry hair, and when I scrunched to break the coating it just made my hair frizzy and even when diffusing I have found my hair to be more frizzy than normal. The fact that it only holds for one day is a deal breaker for me.  Second day I would have straight spots/super frizzy. I have coarse wavy/curly, super thick. Will not buy again."
11,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,What I needed.,I saw this product being used in a video.  First time trying this brand and I am happy with it.  It's a soft holdand it does not dry your hair. If you use it on damp hair it leaves a little texture when dry...not super flat and straight.
12,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best stuff ever,"It feels different than you would expect a gel to feel, however I have never had a product work so well with my curls!! I only use Maui products now because if what it's done with my hair"
13,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible for my fine curls,"This gel didn’t give me a hold, and really lacked in definition. There are so many other products out there that give better results than this product. I regret this purchase."

I wish it was a body lotion too. It works perfect in out hair and doesn’t leave it caked up or hard. We love it!!! Will be buying more.
15,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love for my curls!,"I love having this gel as part of my hair routine! I use it as the last step with ""prayer"" hands and once it dries ""scrunch the crunch"" (which there honestly isn't much). It smells so good and I get so many compliments on my hair!"

I know people thinks I have dandruff, but I don't...it drives me crazy.  This is the 2nd time I've bought a gel and the first was just as bad.. But I'm talking about your product. Liz Brewton"

20,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beware, it's Gel!",Read the description carefully. It's a gel. It holds well but leaves a crunching texture than its cream version.
21,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Wonderful but ....,No hold. Worx best as a Leave-in Conditioner. It did not work for me at all as a hold gel. Like putting wet gelatin on your hair. It dried and my hair went frizzy.

73,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This product just didn't work for me at all.I tried experimenting with different amounts and application techniques and it always ended up the same. This product, on me, at least, just makes my curls look wet. Even when they're not. The wet look doesn't come from a cast, so I can't crunch it out. It just looks...well, slimy. Not great.So, I mean, curl definition was pretty good. It was a bit heavy for my hair, so it dragged my curls down quite a bit. What I ended up with consistently was defined, elongated curls that looked damp or a little greasy. I just wasn't a fan.Now, I have a tricky history with products containing lots of aloe. Usually, aloe dries my hair out a LOT. But I didn't have that problem with this product. Instead, I had the opposite extreme.It made me giggle a bit, because I realized that the look I got with this product is exactly what all the girls went for when I was a teenager in the '90s. If I'd had this product then, I would have been all set! Ha! Now, though, the wet curl look really isn't great for me.I think this product smells amazing. It is a bit sticky feeling, because it feels a bit like it never completely dries.Basically, I think what it boils down to is that this product just wasn't the right fit for my hair."
74,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,This works great on my natural hair.

75,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I reviewed a few hair styling products for Vine recently that probably got a somewhat unfair advantage, because the weather was dry and they were paired with an additional product that I think really enhanced the hold. Well, it started raining and I ran out of that other product. But, this gel is supposed to be ""ultra hold,"" so it should be fine, right?The hold was OK for a few hours, but it eventually gave it up to the humidity. I thought maybe that was just the way it was going to go (I'm still experimenting with wearing my hair curly), but then I tried one of my favorite gels and my curls lasted all day.I also prefer a pump bottle to a tub. It makes it easier to get the correct amount."
76,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My daughter has super curly hair that just comes in tight little ringlets all over her head. It is a challenge to keep her hair moisturized enough that it doesn't frizz up after the first day of wash. We try to only wash her hair once or twice a week because it dries out so bad. It is also a little on the fine side, not as fine as mine but definitely not thick and heavy. I am on the fence about this product.While it smells fantastic, it seems like it's made for someone who washes their hair every other day. I've tried it in large amounts and small amounts and both times the product sits heavy on her hair. I think this is definitely for someone with really thick strands. Again she has a lot of hair but it is a little finer. After it dries it's a little hard to get my fingers through the next day and I feel like it makes it a bit more tangly than normal. It's so heavy that it makes it almost impossible to refresh with water or another product. It's just product overload. While I think this is a fine product, it is definitely not for someone with lots of coily fine hair."
77,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"great hold, not much definition","I was expecting something more along the lines of the Kinky Curly custard, but this isn't quite that. It has excellent hold on it's own, my hair stays in it's curls very well for at least 2 full days before I notice any significant flattening or loss of pattern.However, it doesn't do much for definition for me. I have soft, 2c/3a hair and need to have a defining cream or lotion under this to get the maximum potential out of my curls. That's not necessarily a bad thing as I rarely use only one product, but for a defining and holding gel it's a bit lacking in the former's regard.It does maintain decent levels of softness though so I'm very pleased with that. My ends don't feel crunchy or hard with this."
78,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smell is divine, but I wish the glitter was more noticeable","This does a great job on my wavy hair making it hold shape all day without a wet or crunchy look. I do wish that the glitter was a bit more noticeable. I know it isn't designed to look like big glitter, but there doesn't even seem to be a slight shimmer in the hair. Not a huge deal, but if it's not doing anything, just leave it out.The hold is great for all day wear and with a bit of scrunching and drying, my hair looks great. The scent is very tropical, but not overpowering. This is good because the scent does not dissipate during the day of being exposed to air and elements.Overall, this is a good product that goes a long way. The glitter isn't the most visible, but the hold is great and the scent is a fun tropical."

SO Impressed! I washed my hair one morning and decided to use only this gel instead of doing my product-layering routine. I had a haircut later that day, so if things went south I had no commitment knowing my hair was going to be washed again soon. My hair literally looked amazing with this gel. The curls were perfectly defined, the frizz was controlled, and the entire application felt so hydrating (I had no idea that an aloe-focused gel could work so well). The gel itself is actually really pretty with its lovely shimmer, and the scent is pretty nice too. My hairdresser even said how nice my hair looked when I walked through her door. I don’t know how this stuff works, but it does. Great hair gel for my curls."

I have used this on my and my daughters' hair and love it! It completely holds our curl patterns, but leaves hair flexible and soft enough without feeling crunchy. I also noticed that running my fingers through the hair after its been on for awhile and dried, that there were no white residue build-up, like some other gels tend to make.Very much loving this curly girl's dream of a gel and will be repurchasing!"

I've tried varying amounts with either air drying or blow drying with a defuser and I've never really gotten great results from it. No matter how much I use or what method of drying I use I would not consider it ""ultra-hold"", it's a light hold with my hair. Some products can really bring out the curls in my hair, this one does not. It actually produces more of a smooth wave look. On the positive side it smells good and leaves my hair looking natural and soft if I don't use too much of it."
82,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Less Hold Than A Pomade, But Produces A More Natural Look That I Prefer","I usually use pomades and pastes in my short, thick hair, but wanted to see what this gel would do.  I love it, and hold is dependent on how much you use.  No matter how much I apply, results always look natural while taming frizz.  Hold isn’t as intense as a pomade, but it does accentuate layers, curls and waves very well.  My hair is dry to begin with—I appreciate that the gel doesn’t make it stiff or more dry.  This is a great hair styling product for days when a more natural, tousled look is desired.  On days when humidity is high, I switch out to something with stronger hold, but this is what I now prefer to use most days."
83,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Ultra-Hold Gel, for Curly Hair Styling, Vegan, No Drying Alcohols, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 12oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great version of ""ultra hold""","IMO this gel is lightweight and has a natural hold. It controls frizz and smoothes without getting crunchy and hard. I think the light hold is a much better look. You can really use a ton w/o it getting heavy too. My favorite method of applying is on damp hair after the shower. I work it through my hair from roots to ends and comb through with a wide tooth comb or denman brush. Great hold, no frizz and a fruity fresh scent. I think this is the first of this brand that I've tried, but I'll definitely have to check out their other products!:)"

I layer it with other gels because my hair needs the ""crunch"". The hardened cast that you get that makes the crunch does what curlers would do.  They create a pattern that keeps as your hair dries. With that said, this gives me a lot of moisture and smells lovely, like a tropical drink with coconuts. It's a bit pricier than my usual products, but since I layer it, it lasts a fairly long time."

This is one of the winners. She really likes that it controls her hair and fights frizz (even in high humidity) without adding dry crunchiness.

It is divine.  I do think it is a bit thick for my curls.  I think I will have more success with it if I mix a little water with it in my palm.  Without the water, I feel like I am pulling down too hard on my curls to apply it evenly. The little bit of water makes it glide through easier.  I think this will be best for thicker hair.

Doesn't dry out my hair. Can be heavy on fine or thin hair but will clump really nicely if that's what you're looking for.

Will be buying more & I love that it's vegan,It works great on my straight hair and it works great on my son's curls as well. Smells great. Feels great works great! Found my new hair care brand. As with other products though if you use a leave in conditioner and there's a good amount in your hair and you use this it may clump up the conditioner and you'll have to rewash your hair so be aware. But that's with all gels from my experience.

Unlike other reviewers, I did not find that this product dried my hair out at all.  It is great for second day curls, especially during the summer time.  I wasn't wild about the scent at first, but now I am used to it and it doesn't seem to last after use."
1,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Adds moisture and shine...,"This was just what my hair needed. I wanted some shine and after a couple of sprays that's what I had. There's no need to spray too much because a little goes a long way. I have long fine textured hair. I use a spay or two  on my hair when damp and then a couple additional sprays when dry. The scent is nice and not overpowering. This doesn't have a heavy, oily feel to it. I would say it's quite lightweight. It washes out easily and works with other styling products very well. I would definitely recommend this."
2,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Strong smell and sticky hair.,"I really wanted this product to work, but it made my curly 3a/b hair sticky and tacky to the touch even after drying; I tried using less and more to see what a good amount would be, but I was dissatisfied with any amount I used. It didn’t make my hair softer and shiny as I had hoped. The scent is also VERY strong."

Unfortunately, it has a very strong smell that lingers. I had a slamming headache all day from it. At first I thought it wasn't too bad, reminded me of my old Hawaiian Tropics tanning oil I used in the 80's LOl! But after a while it really started to bother me and gave me a headache. Too bad, I have been looking for an affordable replacement for DevaCurl Mister Right since I can't find that anymore (I think it's discontinued). Due to the strong, chemical, artificial fragrance I can't stand to use this again. The search continues...."
4,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not perfect, but I do like it",I have curly hair and do morning refreshes often. While this alone does not do for my rereshes - this doesn't seem to perk my curls up the greatest but this is very important to my routine.  I use the twist brand to refresh... but that doesn't control frizz very well.  So I go to this as the last step and it not only smells good but tames my frizz.
5,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,A lovely-smelling mess!,"I'm sure I'll like the conditioner when I try it, but when I opened the slightly moist box it came in, the box's interior was shiny with dried conditioner. The lid had only been screwed on partway and it leaked during its journey to my house. I was pretty bummed to get such a messy package with a partially empty bottle.Best-smelling box I've ever received in the mail, though!"

7,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My fave shampoo,I love this line. My hair is usually wavy but I blow dry straight. It’s also very fine so using shampoo and conditioner that weigh it down and are “moisturizing” usually just make it flat and greasy on top. This is perfect. Also the flax seed in it helps as a natural dht blocker which contributes to thinning hair. I noticed since I started using my hair is slowly getting better and I’m losing WAY less hair and it’s started growing in thicker. Can’t be 100 % it’s shampoo alone but it doesn’t hurt and I LOVE how my hair feels with this.

9,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,AWFUL perfume scent. Overwhelmingly strong.,"I was so excited to find this, because I love the Maui products, with limited ingredients, BUT it’s unlikely I’ll be able to use this product. The perfume scent is SOOO strong. It’s like walking through the fragrance section at a department store. A lot of the product had spilled inside the package so I had to clean it up and by the time I was finished, I already had a headache. It’s like Grandma’s perfume. Will likely throw away. Very disappointed."
10,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Use sparingly,This is my go-to spray in the morning when styling my daughter's mixed/wavy hair for school! I spray her hair down with water first then add some sprays of this product and lightly scrunch. Use a few sprays to start then add more product in areas you need it because I have noticed it will weigh the hair down and create a sticky texture if over-applied.
11,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Contains isopropanol-- dries out hair!,Not impressed by this conditioner. Since I started using it my hair has been dry and unmanageable. Looked more closely at the ingredients and it contains isopropyl alcohol-- I wouldn't have bought it if I'd seen that.

After buying Maui' s refreshing mist I just spray let set a few minutes and run my fingers threw it. And it good as it was a week ago."
14,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works so well,"I’m in love with this spray. It’s very light weight on your hair but sets my curls so well. I still use gel on my hair. I have fine curly waves. I don’t know what number of waves my hair is considered but it’s not super curly and not wavy, something in between.  After I wash my hair I use this spray then use my gel. I get so many compliments on my hair. Love this spray"
15,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have super fine, thin, frizzy curly hair and was hoping this won’t weight it down… it does. Just a few sprays and my hair looks super greasy and oily once it dries. It also makes my frizzy ends look more dry yet oily (if that makes sense). The photos show my hair wet after I applied only 3 sprays. This could be great for someone with much thicker hair but definitely didn’t work for my thin curly hair."

I am a big fan of this brand but I’m not sure I will repurchase just for the scent. Some may like it, as scent is subjective though."

I really wanted to like it. It leaves my hair frizzier and feeling so sticky and sometimes stiff. My curls are definitely not refreshed after using it. The only positive thing for me is it smelled nice.
22,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Scent too strong,The scent is very strong and stays all day.

23,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for super thick hair,I have really thick hair and this just doesn't cut it it for me. I have to use 1/4 of a bottle each time just to get anywhere with my hair. I'm not a big fan of the smell either. I think if you have thinner hair it'll revive your hair.
24,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Scent is way too strong,"I can’t even comment on how this works because the product is so strongly scented that I had to immediately rinse out.

28,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,I think its great.,I lost my curls from using really drying dandruff shampoo. I have been trying so hard to find a product that worked for my curls (2c). Sadly most curly hair products were too heavy for my curls and too much oil makes my scalp itch. This was just the perfect amount of moisturizing without being too heavy or oily. My curls are back again after 1 year and curlier than ever. I bought the whole set. Im glad I found what works for me and my curls.

82,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hi, it’s Glamorous Gem, hope you all are having a wonderful day,Anyway, like many curl users, even I don’t wish to do all those extra steps every morning just to keep a fresh look. I wash my hair every 5-7days max and I can’t have too much moisture for my thick, curly hair type. But, mists like these keep them looking good while preventing that dry and brittle part we hate about our curls.I am a avid user of natural hair products because they can do so much good for your roots. Give your hair a break sometimes and take out all the chemicals. This has no chemicals what so ever, no parabens, no gluten, no mineral oil, no sulfates, no silicones, synthetic dyes, etc.It has a clean overall look as well. Despite the bottle being green, the mist is actually white. It has some fragrance in this, but it’s the last on the ingredient list and the other smells such as aloe, coconut, citrus shines much more than anything else in it. So, I don’t even smell it. But, otherwise it smells amazing and definitely adds a nice, clean scent to your curls.I love how lightweight this is, not sticky at all and the sprayer adds such a great coverage even over little sections. Scrunching up my hair is easy and the product moves easily over your hair.Sinks in very quickly and absorbs/dries nicely, adds a decent definition to my dry hair. Even though, product is at its best for wet/damp hair, I still prefer dry for minimal steps. But no matter what state your curls are in, it definitely minimizes the brittle/dryness that comes with them.The isn’t anything to complain about in this mist. It curled my hair up just great and softened them equally as well.  I just add a bit of holding gel and they are back to the way I like them.So, all in all, it seems like a very wonderful product from the Maui moisture brand that I am slowly starting to love. 5/5 earned from me.PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews. Thanks for reading:)"
83,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted so bad to love this, but for me it feels like build up on your hair super fast. I can't imagine using it multiple times a day. My hair felt pretty gross even after just the first time of light misting to refresh. After the second time, I wanted to wash my hair again. It just felt so gunky and it makes my hair tangle even faster. It doesn't make my hair dry, but doesn't actually soften it up either. It won't feel like using a leave in or anything like that. It just feels like .. build up. Gross. Doesn't soften or moisturize.My final complaint is the spray pattern of the nozzle. It sprays too broadly. It sprays everywhere. If I'm spraying the right side, I feel the mist wrap around me and gets all over both shoulders and both arms. If you try to hold it closer to your hair to avoid the over spray, then you will just end up with it all concentrated in one spot, but still some gets everywhere else as well. The spray needs a redesign for sure. I wouldn't get it again. It just makes my hair feel really gunky and dirty. It needs washed much faster than usual. And then the spray issue just ticks me off."
84,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"3-4 sprays  of Maui Moisture's Curl Refresher Mist on my  damp, shoulder length, thick hair is all it takes to wake up my natural curls and waves! Maui's curl mist adds volume and softness to my hair. It keeps flyaways calm and hair nice and smooth. My niece's hair has coils and when she stopped by a few days ago, I had her try it and she was so excited by the bounce and volume it added to her hair.  She's in college and said she was going to have her mother send her a bottle in a care package. Said  she's looking forward to not having to wash her hair daily, she can just revive and freshen her coils with Maui Moisture mist.I love that 100% aloe vera is the very first ingredient, followed by flaxseed oil , coconut water and citrus oil.  All good and important ingredients to help keep hair hydrated and healthy. I just as much love the fact the spray is free of parabens, silicones, surfactants , dyes , mineral oil and gluten.  Its so easy to use: give the bottle a good shake, spray hair , scrunch hair. DONE! That's it! That's all it takes make curls look gorgeous.  I love the way it dispenses when sprayed; it comes out in a mist form , ensuring hair will be evenly covered with the product. Its not heavy; it doesn't weigh hair down or make it look/feel oily or greasy nor does it become hard /crunchy.  There is a light scent to this mist.  Its a citrusy scent. I'm not normally a fan of citrus scents but this scent is GREAT!  Light and airy and isn't overpowering or gagging at all.Maui's refresher mist works great and smells SO good. Because it works so well and I only need a few sprays of the nozzle to sufficiently cover my hair, I do find the price reasonable.  If you're looking for some help to maintain  your curls, give this a try."

Keeping my curls looking and feeling healthy without the fuss and frizz can be overwhelming sometimes.Finding affordable hair products that work well without has chemicals isn't always the easiest.Thankfully, I found this wonderful and affordable, Maui Moisture's Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist for lightweight to medium curls.The bright green packaging and milky green spray colors, I think are both beautiful and tropical.The misting spray has the most amazing scent of aloe vera coconut water & other lush ingredients. It has a wide yet lightweight mist with a milky green look and feel.It has great conditioning and moisturizing power from the first application. It helped to calm my frizz and define my curls with little to no effort on my end. Simply, mist evenly onto my damp hair and scrunch!Did not make my hair greasy nor left with a residue. Just simple goodness and beautiful tamed curls.I really like knowing that the products I use in my hair are Vegan, Paraben Free and Silicone Free, just as this Maui's Moisture spray is.At a price point of approximately $13.99 for this 8.0 fl.oz. bottle, I think is an amazing price for such a great working natural hair product.YES! I highly recommend this curl refresher spray to anyone with lightweight to medium curls, like myself, that need their curls looking and feeling flawlessly bouncy and beautiful!"
86,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I'll be honest: I didn't love this product as a curl refresher. It was just OK for me. The issue is, to see the kind of redefinition I was hoping for, I had to use what was, apparently, too much of this product, which just resulted in my hair looking greasy. I have other refresher products that can reactivate my curls without turning them greasy, so I was *thisclose* to writing off this product as just not right for me after my third attempt.But! Then I had an idea. I only wash my hair every 5 or 6 days. At night, I sleep with it up in a satin-lined cap. Thanks to covid, I haven't had it cut or colored in almost a year, so it's pretty damaged and tends to be dry, starting at about mid-length. Prior to putting it in a cap at night, I usually smooth some hair oil over it so it can sit with the extra moisture on it overnight. I decided to try that with this product instead. I spritzed my hair pretty lightly, and rubbed it in gently, just as I normally do with hair oil. Then I put it up and went to bed. In the morning, I was pleased to see that the overall moisturizing effect was the same. And when I refreshed my curls using my normal curl refresher, they retained just enough of that extra moisture to look healthy and well-moisturized, but not sticky or greasy.So, as an overnight substitute for hair oil, this product worked great for me. That's great news, because this product is a LOT less expensive than the hair oil I normally use!So, overall, I'm happy with this product, even though it didn't work for me for its intended purpose. As an overnight moisturizer and sub for hair oil, it's great."

88,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I regularly use homemade hair spritzers, one containing flaxseed water and another spray bottle with rosemary water for hair growth and conditioning. I was curious to try this because of the flaxseed and Aloe vera ingredients to see if it would work just as well. It works surprisingly well (not quite as good as my homemade hair water) but still conditions quite well. I have long but fine hair. The only thing is it's heavily perfumed. The scent smells nice (like summer/florals), but is slightly overpowering for me personally. I still plan on using this as a quick hair fix for my dry ends. It's a nice product at a reasonable price."

I was hoping this would be a nice wave refresher.  However, after trying it 5 different times with 5 different application ways it still didn’t work for me.  At first my hair waves would be tight, hydrated and look refreshed… but after about an hour they would be right back to their second day flatness but with a sticky/tacky feeling.  Perhaps my hair is just to baby fine for this product? My hair typically responds great to this brand but this particular product was a miss for me."
90,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Both my daughter and I have thick, curly, caucasian hair that we wash, condition, and air dry to style. She has two wash days a week followed by a plop with a leave-in conditioner,  and I wash my hair each day, followed by a heavy conditioner and leave-in. We've both been using this refresher mist and we both enjoy the scent, but it seems to work better on her 20-something hair versus mine which is 50-something and over 50% gray.This flaxseed mist is definitely lightweight and doesn't dry out your hair, but those with thin to normal (thickness) moisturized curls that are already trained will gain the most benefit from using it.  We both found it was non-irritating to our skin and scalps, and the scent was soft and pretty going on our hair which disappeared quickly when it was dry."
91,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"My curl pattern is changing with age and hormones but I would say I am about a 2b/2c depending on the day. I wash and can go a couple of days before the curl starts to frizz or just go straight. Most hair products weigh my curls down or make them limp and lazy. I gave this a try and was pleasantly surprised. First, the smell is fantastic. Fresh, clean light scent. The spritz is very light and I just sprayed this after working in my other shaping cream and gel. I then ""plopped"" my hair for about 10 minutes to get the curls scrunched as I normally do. I am letting my hair air dry and so far the curls look really nice. The big test of this will be a day or two from now when I use it as a ""refreshing"" spray.....but for the first use I am pretty pleased."

I haven't had a lot of luck with products that are specifically made to revive curls.  Most of the ones that I tried were sticking and left my hair feeling tacky.  I would rather have frizzy crazy hair than sticky tacky hair.  I used my fine mist water bottle and gave my whole head of hair a light misting to add some moisture.  Then I used this spray very sparingly all over, as well.  I scrunch the curls and finger coiled a few rougher areas.  My curls did not bounce back right away, but after a few minutes (while the curls dried) they started to spring back.  My curls didn't feel overly sticky or tacky if I barely used any.  When I tried using it on my day three hair I think I used too much and it didn't do as well.  I think less is more with this one.  After a few uses I almost feel like I get a better result with just water because I don't have to worry about using too much and being sticky all day. Not sure I will continue using."
93,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This curl refresher mist has a great smell. The spray has some citrus notes detected. Normally I use a leave on conditioner and a curling gel to achieve the look that I want. I tried using this refresher mist as a replacement and I got very similar results from about 4-5 pumps of the spray and then I scrunched my hair up with my hands. My hair was not frizzy and my curls were defined. The only complaint that I have about this spray is that it leaves a slippery residue on the floor. I had originally sprayed a pump on my hair while I was standing in a tiled room and than I noticed that it left a slippery spot on the floor. After that, I just made sure that I was on the bathroom mat when spraying the refresher."

I have been using tons of different shampoos for the past 10 years and I am 27. Today I used my newly purchased Maui flaxseed shampoo and conditioner, and I believe I have found the shampoo and conditioner I will use for the rest of my life. I’m so used to getting out of the shower and putting 2 to 3 different kinds of products from the same company, not Maui. My hair has not felt so light, so soft and so volumized in almost 10 years. I have tried numerous products with the no victory. This product is amazing it’s a little more expensive than things that people usually use but it’s definitely worth it and you don’t use that much of it. The smell is amazing I can’t stop smelling the shampoo or my hair. It feels so soft thank you So much to whoever made this product."

I have waist long thick wavy hair for reference. I can have wavy styled hair that last for a couple days with and without the help of products. My hair looked great after using this Maui Moisture Hairstyling product, but fell to straight hair after several hours. I was super bummed because I really love the tropical scent and lightweight feel of this products. My hair felt silky soft, without any tangles or crunchiness. Maybe my hair is just too heavy for this product. I don’t recommend this product for anyone with very long hair, unless you have a tight curl pattern."

Second and third day hair doesn't look very curly or nice so I'm trying products to help it bounce back.

It smells nice and tropical, when you first spray it or on your hands it is a little sticky until it dries, but then its softer."

She has curly little ringlets all over her head and her hair is plentiful but on the finer side. This does help me finger calm through them and helps eliminate some of the frizz. It can be overused and get a little sticky but used sparingly this does a great job. It smells fantastic and that makes me happy because there's some funky smelling stuff out there. To cut the product, I usually use this and a little fine misted water for just a daily refresher. Otherwise, we would have some major frizz going on here!"

It's one of those mist I spray on my hair and then smell my hair. The scent is a light coconut smell and it lingers for a while too. My hair is naturally curly so I can spray this on after my hair has been towel dried and I would use it to gives it a nice healthy shine. Or I would spray it on completely dry hair a few days later to give it extra bounce and texture. I do squeeze my hair after I spray it to keep things in place. It's moisturizing and does not make my hair feel crunchy. I’m glad I got to test it out!"

I find that it is very sticky and weighs my hair down. It’s possible it could be because I have fine, thin hair though.

It makes her hair less poofy and frizzy. It does weigh her hair down a bit, which she doesn't like so much because she has thin curly hair. On days with lots of humidity, though, she appreciates this. It doesn't feel filmy, sticky, crunchy, or greasy in her hair like a lot of other curl sprays do. She sprays it on her hair while it's damp and scrunches it. It has a nice, light scent that's not really noticeable once it dries."

Waking up the next morning- still soaked. It never dried fully before I showered again. I tried it again and found it was twice as bad trying to blow dry my hair. My hair is knotted and sticky like cotton candy. Terrible product. Absolute trash."

When I tried to use it to refresh my hair, it left behind a sticky mess.  When I used it on freshly wet hair, it worked much better.  It has a fresh clean scent that was pleasant and not overwhelming.  I really appreciate the lack of silicone in it."

I like it because it leaves my hair soft and easier to manage; not as harsh with natural ingredients.  I color my hair a lot so this is a giant plus!  I recommend all types; my daughter and granddaughters use this so we have several choices in the shower 😊Only disappointment is several times we received it with a broken lid or the bottle had leaked inside the package…BUT the company replaced it ASAP!!

124,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful,I’ve been using Maui Moisture products for the past 6 years. Sometimes I change what kind I’m using based on my hairs needs. I chose to focus on my curls so I got this with the matching shampoo. They smell absolutely great! But the conditioner dries my hair out like CRAZY! No matter how much I use it makes my hair feel brittle and it makes it come out in clumps!! I have never been more disappointed with a conditioner. I’d be better off with $1 store conditioner.

The scent is pretty good I do enjoy that and the convenience of the spray bottle. The idea is great I just wish the product was a little more light weight.
128,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shampoo & Conditioner,"love this shampoo and conditioner! i recently tried another brand and couldn't wait until the bottles were empty so i could go back to this. it leaves my hair light and bouncy, instead of weighted down like many other products. the refresher spray is tricky though, i'd suggest spraying it onto your hands and then curling your curls and not using a lot. if you use too much it can become sticky. no down sides to the shampoo and conditioner though! love it!"
129,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely the best!,I have 2C/3A hair. It’s curly wavy medium fine hair. Everything weighs my hair down. This is the VERY FIRST curl refresher I have ever used that does not weigh my hair down or make my hair look greasy. I used it all winter and every morning I spray a little on the frizzy curls and done. This is the first time in six years since going natural that I have loved my hair in the winter. Just finished my first bottle. I’m about to buy another.  I love the smell and it’s more of a nonoily mist. Never change the ingredients. I love it!

143,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Curls + Flaxseed Curl Refresher Mist, Conditioning and Moisturizing Spray with Aloe Vera, Flaxseed Oil, Coconut Water, Vegan, Paraben Free, Silicone Free, 8oz",Style: Shampoo,Verified Purchase,"I have long medium thick curly hair. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve been noticing the products I used to rely upon do not work the same way. I was often unhappy with my hair. At first I was hesitant because it doesn’t foam much, but it left my hair squeaky clean and feeling fresh. The real test was how my hair looked after it dried. It wasn’t as much curl as I was hoping for, but what there was consisted of nice loose and long ringlets. Reading previous review I know many complained over the smell. I love it. It smells clean and in a way reminds me of something in the mint family. The smell does stay with you, but I did it find it as strong as others said. I only needed a dollop about the size of a quarter and took my time working it in. I am very happy with it so far."

1,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly hair,"I have hair that forms into ringlets; they used to frizz but this stuff is AMAZING.  Really makes my hair shine and keeps the curls smooth.  If the curls start to sag during the day, I wet my finger tips and scrunch the curls and they bounce right back.  I do the same on the days I don't want to wash my hair.  Smells lovely, too--not heavy but really beachy.I originally bought it in a drug store but, apparently, it's a very stealable substance as their inventory says they have it but no one could find ANY on 3 different occasions! Thanks, Amazon!"

6,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this product as the reviews were overall pretty good. I've used curl mousse my whole life and wanted to try something different. The first time I used it, I was happy with the scent. It's definitely coconut scented, which I love. And it worked well with the scent of my shampoo, so that was a win. However, that was the only positive. Once my hair was styled and dried, it looked like a matted ball of fur. I had no definition to my curls/waves and my hair was STICKY. Literally, sticky. I tried to give it a couple of days to figure itself out, but it just got worse. My hair was such a tangled mess by the second day, I had to wash it out. I thought, ""well, maybe I used it wrong"" so I tried it again the following week and let my hair air dry instead of diffusing it. But nope, same issue.  I tucked the mousse into my basket of hair products and said I'd try again later because maybe third time's the charm? Fast forward a few weeks and I went to use it again, except no foam came out. The dispenser just squirted straight liquid instead of the foamy mousse. I spent 5 minutes trying to figure out why it wouldn't spray mousse and then gave up and used the liquid instead. Aaaaand nope. Still isn't working right. My hair just looked wet and greasy and it was sticky again. So tangled, not soft or lightweight. I'm so frustrated and disappointed because I've been using mousse for almost 20 years and haven't had an issue like this ever. I'll definitely trash this product and won't be buying it again."
7,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super Impressed,"I have struggled every since I was little to find the right kind of products for my hair. This product does wonders for my hair! It doesn’t take long to dry . It doesn’t weigh down my hair or anything like that. It smells great and it makes my hair look very pretty and nourished. I don’t use any other products with it. I just wash and condition my hair while I’m in the shower and wrap my hair up in a towel. Then I comb through my hair one more time and put a mountain of foam in my hand and I do this maybe 3 times for my scalp, my middle section of hair and then my bottom section of hair. I then comb my hair again and then finger comb my hair and just let it air dry. And it turns out amazing! I have used a hair dryer too but I like the results better when I air dry. I hope this helps."
8,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE!!!!!,"Edit: I had added a picture of my hair, but whoever reviewed my review for this product posted a picture that I have never even taken. My picture was not on the original review. Hopefully the picture the reviewer posted instead of mine, will not show up on this review.My hair has been super dry ever since I chopped it all off and let my natural grey grow. This has added the moisture my hair has desperately needed! I've tried more expensive hair products that did not help the dryness and left my hair feeling heavy. I will be buying this product again in the future ☺️"
9,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my hair,"I have always worn mousse. I like my hair to hang naturally but back out of my face. Mousse does the trick for me. I try a new brand here and there... but usually go back to TREsemme. On a lark, I picked up a bottle of this. I was a bit startled when I discovered that this mousse did not use an aerosol dispenser. I thought, ""this is going to be bad."" I thought it would apply and hold like a gel, which is too much for me. I was wrong. This mousse is absolutely perfect for my hair. I doubt I will ever try another brand... as long as I can continue to find this brand."
10,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Waves,"This product works really well for my 2a wavy, high porosity hair. It leaves me with beautiful, soft waves and even some spirals. This product DOES develop a cast as it dries (that crunch people don't like). The purpose of this is to hold your hair in your curly pattern as you air dry or diffuse it. Once your hair is fully dry, gently scrunch it and the cast will break. You'll be left with soft, hydrated hair. The aloe in this works wonders for my high porosity. I've noticed my hair overall looking healthier since I started using it."
11,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply amazing...,"After using this I can't even tell I have product in my hair once dry, no need to scrunch cast, it leaves my hair bouncy and touchable with no noticeable scent.  I have very fine thin light hair so that is a major struggle with a lot of products leaving my hair feeling sticky or looking greasy or weighing it down and I'm also very sensitive to scents and perfumes. This stuff is perfect, I can only tell I've used anything because my hair looks thicker with more volume and less frizz.  Using this makes wash and go hair possible for me giving me princess curls with zero effort."
12,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was looking for,"The scent and lightweight ness of this was fine, however, it made my hair feel so very dry after I had used it and then washed, and trying to brush my hair out after having used this product and washed it out, was nearly impossible. It changed the texture of my hair and took several washes and discontinuing use for it to go back to normal. Also I feel like I would have to use a ton of it for it to really work ... just not what I was looking for."
13,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect hold,This stuff works! I have thick hair and experimented with the flexi rods trend! This stuff really held the curls!!
14,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Concentrated,"I dont know how to describe the texture, but this product is super concentrated. When you pump it out, the foam is thick and very sticky. I had to dilute it by half with water. I guess that's a good thing since now I have twice the product"
15,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It does the job!,"I like the hold this foam gives me and the scent! But it doesn’t do much in the wag of moisturize or defining my curls, and if I add one pump too much it looks a bit like my LA gel day in 6th grade, crunchy.. I do have pretty fine wavy hair though, so it probably works better in coarse hair."
16,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my curl pattern,I have thick 2c- 3a hair texture and this didn’t really work for me. I need a more firm hold. My moms hair texture is 2a-2b (thick as well but lees course) and it works better for her. It just felt sticky and heavy in my hair and didn’t help my curls form or stay in their style despite the light formula. Love the sent tho. The texture is more like a foamy soap then a traditional moose. I couldn’t say anything about the “moisturizing” affects because the product wasn’t right for my hair.
17,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing and Light,"As I get older, my hair is becoming more wavy and dry. I've tried several different products. Maui moisture mousse is great! It's very moisturizing yet doesn't weigh down my fine hair. I've gotten the best and easiest waves from the product and ""plopping"" with a t-shirt alone! Plus, I love the way it smells! It's sort of summer-y but not strong. I have finally found my go-to hair product!"

I love the mouse in this brand and decided to try this product.  I was not completely satisfied because once my hair dried it was very frizzy and product provided no definition or hold to any of my curls.  Probably better for individuals who do not have thick curls.

Only complaint is when I plop my hair for drying, the product gets an odd tacky feel for my curls.

218,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 50 REVIEWER,"If you want a lightweight styler with no crunch, this foam mousse is for you. The first ingredient is aloe vera, so it won't leave your hair feeling stiff or hard. It defines curls in a softer manner. For that reason, I think it's perfect for rod sets. You can also use it if you already have a strong hold gel in your hair as a refresher. The scent is light and pleasant. The formula is a bit sticky, but it rinses off easily. I highly recommend this product.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier."
219,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"# My ReviewThis review is for Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse. My wife has long, curly hair that dries out easily, loses volume / depth, and is difficult to manage. With that in mind, she’s tried many styling mousses from various brands and it’s either been hit or miss. It’s the first time she’s using any Maui Moisture product and the results were a pleasant surprise.First of all, the mousse is delivered in a relatively strong blue and gold colored bottle with the Maui Moisture branding and details of the ingredients, formula, directions of use, etc. clearly defined on the front & back. The product branding is clear, concise, and on point, so you can easily see why you’d use this product.The mousse is very easy to use on dry or wet hair. First of all, the pump delivers an even amount of mousse that can be applied as needed. A little goes a long way with this hair product, so don’t overdo it. The mousse has a consistency and viscosity that’s semi thick, and produces a considerable amount of foam. Once applied it covers the hair nicely and isn’t sticky or gel like. There’s an awesome scent that’s fresh and invigorating - not overwhelming.Overall, the mousse does a great job creating naturally looking curls that aren’t stiff or crunchy. The specialized blend does a good job of making curly hair more manageable, naturally looking, and defined with volume. Looking at the product details, quality, and price point, it’s also reasonably good value. I recommend.If you found this review informative, then please click on the “[Helpful]” button to let me know to continue providing these unbiased and in-depth reviews for this community.

220,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This foam mousse ends up feeling more like a crunchy, yet somehow sticky gel after it dries. It makes my hair a bit too crunchy and it dried out my ends terribly. I try to use even lesser amounts and avoid the ends a bit, but I still end up not liking the finished results too much. It does keep the shape of your curls and actually seems to spring them up a bit, but the excessive drying is just too much. For a product that is supposed to be better for your hair, it sure does do some damage. Along with the crunch, it's just too much.It pumps out nicely into a nice foamy mousse. I didn't have any complaints about dispensing or anything like that. It's just that it does things to my hair that I definitely try to avoid."
221,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"First off, my bottle came all crunched with product leaked out all over it, so they need to put this in a box so that doesn’t happen. Or, use a stronger bottle. Since it’s vacuum packed, there’s no way to release the pressure so it will always be crunched in like this. It still works, I just had to clean off all the sticky product that had dried all over it. The mousse is light, like most are, and has a light tropical smell that goes away fairly quick. I have naturally wavy hair so this is great if I just want more of a beach waves look as opposed to more curly hair, which I have to use a curl gel for. This doesn’t make my hair crunchy at all and if I use it the next day, after getting my hair damp, it doesn’t seem to cause build up that weighs it down. This is pretty much what most mousse does to my hair. I like that this has quality ingredients that help keep my hair moisturized instead of drying it out. This will be a nice alternative to the curl gel on days when I just want some light waves."
222,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have very fine, somewhat dry, curly hair. It tends to frizz especially when I've color, so I like a little bit of something to help control the frizz. I hope this would be a good product for that and while it does help control frizz it does leave my hair looking a little bit greasy. If I messed it up enough but it doesn't look greasy it goes back to being frizzy.The smell is nice, reminds me of the seaside and sunscreen can I get triggered into headaches from smell fairly easily.So not really what I'm looking for but I imagine if you have thicker denser hair this stuff might work really well for you."
223,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This is wrapped in plastic, with good reason as it leaked in shipment. The bottle was actually sucked in, like it had been through a pressure change, and I had to open it to get it back to it's normal shape. I had to rinse it and let it air dry as well since it was covered in leaked product. I used it in my hair today. It is not as lightweight as I'd anticipated and I think four pumps was too much for my shoulder-length hair. It smells wonderful and is giving me the look I'd hoped for. I like that it avoids the same harmful toxins that I do."
224,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I review a lot of hair products for Vine - both because I like hair products and because that's what they offer me. The problem is, it's hard to review hair products. Different products work differently for different people and also react differently with other products. So I end up giving most things 4 stars.This foam spreads a little easier than mousse, like most foams. It's pretty pleasant to use and the curls are good. I personally like a bit more hold, but they don't call it strong hold, so the light hold is expected."
225,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have pretty thick long curly hair, it is down to the middle of my back with it is dry.  This mousse is very light.  For a firm hold this isn't that great for my hairs thickness/weight.  It didn't overly dry out my hair it didn't keep up with it all day.  For a relaxing day or hangout day it would be a better option.The smell is nice but a bit strong if you are not a coconut fan you won't like it.It isn't super expensive and does work its just not for everyday use for me."
226,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,dries out my curls,As a person letting mother nature's highlights grow in I already have the dryness that comes with gray hair.  That plus curly hair means that I am always adding moisture. This mousse held my hair fine but it made my curls even more dry.  I also wasn't able to refresh the 2nd day curls as easily with this product.  I use a gel from this company that I love so I guess it is just hit or miss with their products.  The price is what drew me to this product but it is not for me and my curly grays.
227,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells pleasant, makes great wavy scrunchy curls in my normally straight long hair. I apply when hair is still wet. It does make curls have a bit of crunch so it is a bit drying. I only do my hair in a scrunchy curl every few weeks so this is ok with me, but I realize if I used this on a daily basis I feel like my hair would get pretty dried out and have some buildup. That being said based on the price point it does the job and I would order it again."
228,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Unexpected Results,"Whenever there are new products out there for curly hair, I like to try them. This product I was a little skeptical about, but I was proven wrong. I didn't think it would be able to keep my curls looking good and frizz-free. but it did. And it's so much lighter than the gels I've been using. Perfect for summer. I'm really glad I found this."
229,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This mousse is lightweight, offers just enough hold but doesn't leave my curls crunchy or feeling bare. I like the scent, its a very tropical, fruity scent. I normally let my hair air-dry and this worked well to keep it neat and keep it from puffing out on me. I also noticed it didn't leave any white flakes on my scalp when I move my roots around, which is fantastic."
230,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the coconut smell of this mousse. The consistency of the mousse is a little weird though. When I try to apply it to wet hair, the mousse wants to stick on my hands and doesn't transfer onto my hands very well. Once in my hair this product gives my hair body for DAYSSS. No crunchy feeling but my hair does feel heavy with product afterwards."
231,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells amazing! The scent is not overpowering. It smells like sweet fruits. I used this with my daughter, who has loose curls that easily become frizzy. It did not take much product to use on my daughters hair. Her hair was not stiff or sticky. Her hair was not frizzy but Sadly it did not do much to enhance her curls."
232,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the control you have when you dispense this mousse.  You can get just the amount you need rather than the bottle giving you a huge squirt all at once.  The scent is very pleasant, and I appreciate the moisturizing ingredients as I have rather dry hair.  I would say that it has a medium hold."
233,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,The mousse smells nice and it is very light weight. The mouse will work great on people who have wavy curls. I need a more sturdier hold.
234,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,This is lighter than any other mousse I have tried. It does not weigh my curls down at all. I love the smell and how light and airy it is. I have been using this with the gel and curl refresher spray and my hair looks very healthy and shiny.

237,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,There is alcohol,"False advertisement. If you look at the ingredients, there is alcohol denat."
238,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curls and retwist,I use this for my locs and it holds pretty well. It’s been 2 weeks and my retwist still looks nice. I also use this for my 3 year olds curls with some leave in and looks good. This stuff is sticky that’s the only thing I don’t like but I love that the main ingredient is aloe Vera. It’s the reason I bought it instead of using the aloe gel for my retwist. Gets an A from me.
239,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs Better Packaging,"Amazon really needs to pack liquids better. My bottle DID NOT have a top on it, so about an inch of the liquid was all over the other items in my box.  It didn't have bubble wrap or anything. Just a bottle with no top banging against the box and dripping everywhere.  As far as the actual product, it has a nice scent and works well...but I hate dealing with a sticky mess on everything else."
240,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy heavy heavy,"I wanted this for beach waves but it’s so heavy it weighs down even the slightest wave. Not much hold at all and whatever you get while wet, goes away pretty quickly.I have 2c hair (thick, coarse, more s-wave than curl) and this pales in comparison to what salt spray can do. To be fair, this probably moisturizes better though.Smells good, but not worth it."
241,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves hair greasy,I’m redoing this reviews and giving it 2 stars.

245,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for 3C curls,"There are mixed reviews, probably because this only works for certain hair types. I have 3C hair and this works great. Makes my curls soft and defined with no crunch. I apply a little bit and then finger curl. Good value for money as well."

257,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Hair doesn't block my eyes,"The pic without my beard tied is me straight out the shower with no product in and pre combed. The one where I'm still shirtless but my beard is braided is also before any product but combed. Hair still wet in both. The 3rd pic is with maui mousse in after going to Walmart for over an hour to buy it and other shopping. This is my first time ever growing my hair out so I don't have any experience with any other product but I can tell you that it keeps my hair out of my face significantly. Before using this, all my hair would be in my face with just a slight angle downward of my head and after using this it keeps most of it in place. It feels like my hair is wet yet it's dry. Not like watery, but how wet hair feels minus the water. The scent is a mild coconut. It keeps hair from blocking my vision like a shaggy dog and that's all I wanted it for, but it's also lightweight and has good ingredients. I don't regret my purchase"
258,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving it❤️,I and my daughter use this. I shake and pump about 4 to 5 skirts. Hair feels soft and smells great. When hair is completely dry..I then scrunch..hair looks fuller and curls are defined.
259,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Texture of hair was okay,"Did the job, but I was not a fan of the smell. It was very coconut like but if you like that it’s perfect. Usually my hair gets crunchier with these type of products but it didn’t do that with this. It just kept it a bit wet like for the remainder of the day. I probably won’t buy it again."
260,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I do not recommend,"I used this product daily. Next day,….My hair felt damaged. This product smells great and feels great the same it’s used but me personally I noticed my hair just kept feeling more dry the more I used it, and breakage started with continued used. I had high hopes for this product with its limited ingredients. But it just wasn’t good for me."
261,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,This product made my curls pop. No buildup or residue. Will purchase again.

To add lift to your hair, tilt your hair forward and spray at half an arms length. Than put hair in desired style and spray gently.  Love this product.  I have naturally curly hair."
263,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works so well,I bought this for my hair not Sure how it would work. I was looking to replace a product I really liked but is no longer available. I have a thick curly hair and I put it in when it’s wet it dries with soft curls and I love it. My hair is still soft and it’s not crunchy at all.It doesn’t give the volume that the other product did but it’s really good. I do use a light volumizing spray on it if I want extra volume. I like that it’s natural it has a little bit of a smell but not much and it’s such a great find. I would totally recommend you try it.
264,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dried out my hair,The scent was good but made my hair frizzy and dried it out and had to throw it out. True it three times

267,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sooo helpful for my hectic curly hair journey,"Such a good mousse!! I've been working on figuring out how to treat my curls, and it's been hit or miss until I found this product. Here are the...PROS: 1. It literally smells so good, for DAYS. Any person with curly hair knows you don't wash your hair every day, but sometimes you want that good ""freshly washed"" smell even on day 3. This really does that. It's not ""perfumey"" or over the top, it's just really good smelling.2. It really, actually works. It doesn't make my hair crunchy or stringy once it's dry and scrunched out, instead it leaves behind soft, gentle curls. I can run my hands through my hair after using this and the curls maintain their shape.3. It enhances shine and keeps away frizz.4. It doesn't build up and cause heavy, dull hair.5. It's so much cheaper than the comparable brands.CONS: I really don't have any. The bottle is pretty and spill proof, you don't have to use too much of it so it lasts a good while, it's easy to wash out.....there are no cons yet. I will update this if there are!I hope this review was helpful! I've gone through soooo many products to find ones that work, I hope I can shorten that process for you!"

This one popped up on Amazon. It was not very expensive and had good reviews. I ordered not expecting much. But it is amazing!!! I'm 62 and I've noticed my lush curls have been thinning and losing their "" oomph.""  This brought my hair back to life! It looks like a lion's mane! It smells fresh and most importantly, it's not sticky or crunchy. At first it feels like it might be but it dries soft and bouncy. I mostly air dry but I diffused the roots holding my head upside down. Sounds crazy but adds volume. I DID NOT get ripped off and I am ordering more!!!"

281,"Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse, for Curly Hair Styling, No Drying Alcohols, Parabens or Silicone, 8.5oz",Style: Foam Mousse,Verified Purchase,"I was surprised at the size of this bottle. It’s way bigger than most mousse products I’ve used. I love the consistency but I do wish the product had a slightly better hold. I normally use gel to set my curls on wash days & was hoping to use this instead but it’s doesn’t hold my curls as well. It works good for in between washes, it’s light & airy so it doesn’t weigh down your hair."

Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't use if you have sensitive skin!!!!,"I got both the shampoo and conditioner. They both smelled great. When I actually used them, they didn't feel as good as I had hope, and I kind of had a reaction to the product. My scalp, neck, ears, and face got red and hot. I don't think there was anything specific in the product that I'm usually sensitive to- it's just a really intense product. The ingredients are natural, but too much of a good thing isn't a good thing. Definitely don't use if you have sensitive skin!! It took an hour-long cold shower and lots of my old shampoo to get the product completely out and to calm my skin. I was really excited about this product, but it's definitely not for me."

Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,a natural shampoo that works,"I don’t know if it’s good or bad that my hair feels clean after I use this.  The obvious disadvantage to this is I have to use a conditioner, there’s no getting around it.  And like commercial brands of shampoo my hair still has some morning frizz.  However, the advantage is that I know it works.I have tried a LOT of natural shampoos and my hair doesn’t have that clean feel and can only go a day, maybe 2 before needing washed because it looks greasy.  This shampoo is natural but my hair feels clean, even after conditioner, and doesn’t get greasy again fast.  Yet my hair feels so soft, even days later, even the gray hair.  And I have reduced crazy fly aways (I still have mild fly away).It is a very thick shampoo so takes some practice to get the right amount.  It’s a pricey bottle as well but I can get away with the same amount of shampoo as if I used a commercial brand whereas most natural shampoos I have to use twice as much to even hope for a cleanliness to my hair so this lasts longer than other natural brands I’ve used, it makes up for the price.  It does not lather the same as commercial shampoos but it does lather the same or better than other natural brands.  It does not have to lather to work so don’t use more than you need.The smell is also amazing.  This is a definite win for a natural brand.  I will say that it does still have a long list of ingredients though."

Oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"We both liked using this shampoo. My wife said afterward her hair has fewer tangles than the shampoo she was using before. We both felt our hair was softer and more manageable – which isn’t a big feat for my short hair but it is for my wife’s medium to long hair. It smells good and is pleasant to use.The vegan claim may strike people as laughable since it seems silly that any animal products find their way into shampoo. I did some research finding out that it’s more than likely that non-vegan shampoos do contain some or even many animal products. It’s hardly a sure thing since US labeling requirements don’t identify animal-sourced items when there’s doubt with products that can be animal or non-animal derived.My wife’s a vegan so that this shampoo is free of animal parts scored big points with her. I have to agree. I’d prefer no animal products unless absolutely necessary. Since this shampoo does a great job and leaves the animals alone, it rates highly in our household."
116,"Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi Moisturizing Vegan Shampoo with Coconut Oils for Shiny Hair, Silicone-Free & Sulfate-Free Surfactant Aloe Shampoo to Detangle & Hydrate Dull Hair, 13 fl. Oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have to admit I laughed at this shampoo having traveled to Amazon before arriving one island over (a 15 minute flight( on Oahu.  I am not sure how well known Awapuhi (locally known as shampoo ginger, for its' fragrant sap) is on the continent.  It is a ginger relative which produces large, cone shaped flowers (image attached) that release a fragrant liquid, I am not sure if it would properly be called sap, when squeezed.  It is often found when hiking in wet areas, and actually grows in standing water.  It is a much loved flower here, with a beautiful fragrance.  I had to see hgow well it translated.  As something of a fragrance fiend I have yet to find a gardenia perfume which smells anything like gardenia, or a jasmine which is really true (well, actually I have found the jasmine in s small British niche perfume) but it is difficult to find because flower essences are most often steam extracted which leaves them smelling cooked, not much like the flower.  Awapuhi is different because of the abundance of fragrant liquid (sap?) and Maui Moisture seems to have captured it well!  The scent is true, it is strong and really a lovely fragrance.  That is where the 4 stars comes from.  Actually, I would give the fragrance 5 stars.  It is very well done.The shampoo I was less happy with.  For one, the bottle is not sealed.  I am frankly surprised UPS delivered it.  It was leaking so badly that the envelope it was shipped in was soaked and dripping.  Something which has to travel as far as this does really ought to have the bottle sealed.The shampoo is an odd combination of ingredients for shampoo.  The first ingredient is aloe vera, which suddenly seems to be in everything.  It is abundant, and cheap.  A friend gave me a plant about 15 years ago.  I now have hundreds, despite donating hundreds each year to my kids' school carnival.  Aloe is actually an astringent.  It is typically applied to burns.  The sap is thick and sticky.  I do not know why anyone would want to put it in their hair.  I am actually allergic to aloe, so I gave this shampoo to my daughter to test.  She has several feet of hair and is very particular about what she uses.  No doubt she was delighted by the natural ingredients, and also the avapuhi.  The shampoo also contains coconut milk, which is also everywhere.  I am very glad the shampoo does not smell like coconut, which I am personally sick of, and makes me think of cheap tourist sunscreen.  That said, you do not get that feel from this shampoo.  Coconut is fatty, and much better for your hair or skin than your body. (Nutritionists says not to consume it ever because of the high saturated fats).  That said, the oil is a lot mkore moisturizing than the milk, so it was sort of an odd choice.  I am not seeing where the moisture comes from.  The scent is wonderful, but I am less happy with it as a shampoo.  It is something my daughter and I both may not notice as we use conditioner, but the ingredients are not especially moistruizing.  This is not a shampoo I would use without conditioner, but it will not strip your hair either like a lot of shampoos do.The ingredients are natural, a huge plus.  The scent is lovely, really well done here.,  Those who know awapuhi will be impressed, those who don't ought to be delighted by the scent.  I rated it 4 stars because it is all natural and the fragrance is lovely but it is not the best shampooo I have used, and they really do need to seal the bottles so that they can travel safely thousands of miles by air."

So it's the conditioner that wreaks havoc on my hair, turning it dry and straw-like.But definintely CAN use this Maui shine shampoo with a different conditioner and my hair is definitely soft and ""light"" feeling, so I do recommend this shampoo!****************************************'Well this was an odd experience (btw, I purchased mine at Target).  I have some natural wave to my hair, but can also easily straighten it.  Seems kind ""average"" hair.This shampoo, along with the Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate Shea Butter conditioner, were a really bad combo for my hair.  Even using the conditioner, my hair didn't feel soft at all while I was conditioning it.  It felt soft of 'dry' and straw-like.I've only used this combo twice but am giving both products away because at first I thought it was a fluke that my hair felt so coarse and straw-like.  A couple of weeks later I used both products again and nope.  Bad idea.  My hair is coarse today and very very dry  (the day after using these).Seems odd since these are both supposed to be moisturizing.  And I have great results with Dove Moisture products and Aussie and Redken, as well as a host of others.  Anyway, just didn't work for me."

Aloe Vera is the first ingredient, which means the consistency is alot like, well, aloe vera.  Clear, a bit slimy and comes out in glurp of shampoo. I loved scent of the shampoo, which has ginger and florals.  I will say that after the shampo, my hair was very tangly and conditioning was an absolute must.  I  liked this shampoo enough that I will likely purchase the conditioner.Would give 5 stars, but some of the ingredients are still too chemicall-y for the natural/vegan branding of this shampoo."

Hawai’i. The awapuhi smells genuine, and the label gets it right when it states that the awapuhi flower is generally used in shampoos. It feels authentic, and there is just so much that this product gets right.One of the good things about this product is the fact that it is sulfate free. Even more so, it is free from parabens, silicones, and dyes, all the while maintaining a vegan label. Supposedly it detangles and hydrates hair, but so far, I’ve only experienced the hydration. When kept long, my hair notoriously tangles often, so I had rather high hopes when I saw this one advertising to combat that. While it hasn’t helped with the one issue, at least my hair isn’t as staticky as it used to be anymore due to the increase in hydration.The only real gripe I have is with the protective seal, or really, lack thereof. When the shampoo arrived, I was saddened by the sight of an exploded bottled - half the content was sludging about in the bag. If you’re actually purchasing your own bottles, then this is unacceptable. Perhaps having a small piece of tape would be enough to combat the abuse experienced during delivery. Otherwise, again, this is unacceptable when it seems to be a prevalent issue mentioned throughout reviews."

Oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been looking for a shampoo that can smooth out my coarse, curly hair without making it greasy or weighing it down.  It is usually visibly tangled, wavy, and dull, but this shampoo makes it straight and shiny. My hair used to look so damaged, because it wasn't fully straight, but also not completely wavy. It was always a mess and I had to brush it every hour. It was dull and course to the touch, and you couldn't even run your hand through it. My scalp was also irritated (possibly from my last shampoo). Now, my hair feels light and soft, and so much less dull. It gets tangled way less easily, and my flyaways and split ends have calmed down.  This shampoo relaxes my tight curls and gives my hair soft waves. Hair looks healthy and still has good volume despite how moisturizing the shampoo is. I can go a few days without washing my hair before it becomes greasy.  The smell is great, doesn't smell too powerful or artificial."

Keep it away from the young kids. The shampoo has a thick consistency. I had to either wait or squeeze it out slowly. It does a wonderful job cleaning my hair and lathers generously. You don't need to use much to get the job done. It really smells like a fruit drink.  After rinsing it off with water, the hair is clean but becomes lumpy and stiff. I had to finish it off with a conditioner, which ended up smothering the strong fruit scent.  A few hours later, my hair still feels very clean and my scalp is not dried out as before. This Maui shampoo doesn't dry out the scalp! I'm very impressed."

This makes something that actually still cleans a MUST in our house. This works really well. I am impressed with how little frizz we are seeing in her hair now. We definitely still need conditioner, but this is a really awesome base that cleans well. My big complaint is that it is a bit strong in the scent department, but it does tame nicely as you rinse and then your hair dries. Great option for those who want to buy a greener product, but are afraid it won't clean well. This definitely will!"

I have to use a lot of this product for my shoulder-length hair (like the size of a ping-pong ball), and it takes more work to get a nice lather than a product with sulfates. However, it is possible to work up a beautiful lather, and the smell is lovely. For me, the bottle will last about 10 shampooings.  This does allow me to go a few days between shampoos so the bottle is about a month's supply.  The shampoo is moisturizing, but a conditioner is mandatory. After rinsing and before shampooing, my hair is extremely snarly and hard to comb through. But adding a conditioner makes this really work. My hair is shiny and bouncy and good smelling with this product."

I was excited about this one because its supposed to have great slip when washing which is crucial for detangling my curls. Instead of it being a fluid liquid like most other shampoos, this one came out like a thick gel consistency which lathered well. I didn’t need much to wash my hair and it left my hair feeling a little too squeaky clean but not completely stripped. It did nothing for detangling my hair, because it left it so clean I had to gently detangle afterwards with my conditioner. It smells really nice and the scent only slightly lingers on the hair."

The shampoo is a pretty thick gel like consistency and it bubbles quite easily.The scent is a nice, fresh, citrus-y, fruity scent that I can't really identify what it is. It's not too strong, just right.It's quite nice though! The shampoo left my straight, mid-back length hair really soft and also feeling squeaky clean. I really like this shampoo and will continue using this for a while to see if it improves hair health."

Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,smells so good,"I'm in love with the smell of this shampoo.  It's light, but delicious.  The shampoo lathers up nicely, and rinses out without leaving any leftover residue.  After using my hair was a little frizzier than when I use my normal shampoo.  My hair didn't become greasy and in need of another washing until 3 days later which is pretty good.  I've used it several times and I'm going to keep using it, and see how it goes."
131,"Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi Moisturizing Vegan Shampoo with Coconut Oils for Shiny Hair, Silicone-Free & Sulfate-Free Surfactant Aloe Shampoo to Detangle & Hydrate Dull Hair, 13 fl. Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works amazingly and smells very nice,I really liked this shampoo. It made my hair feel way cleaner than with the Pantene shampoo I normally use and the smell is awesome! I had my 9 year old use it as well since her hair gets greasy looking after just two days and it’s helped her hair a lot to stay fresh and clean looking as well. I hope to get the conditioner soon to try that out as well. I love that it doesn’t include bad parabens and all that junk other brands use that are bad for hair and that it’s not tested on animals. Over all I highly recommend!

The shampoo itself is very Gel-like rather than creamy, it makes it a little difficult to extract the appropriate amount from the shampoo bottle because it comes out in a clump almost, but you only need very little. I love the ingredients."

It's thick and a little slimy feeling, which was a bit of surprise. Thankfully, all of that washes out and does not leave your hair feeling weird. But, then again, I did use it with my regular conditioner."

Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very nice shampoo. It smells amazing and fresh. Softening and moisturizing. A bit of a shine. I'll keep using it and update since I've only used it once so far. It's not meant to create a ton of suds since it doesn't have all the chemicals. It's a translucent shampoo. A little goes a long way if you're cleaning your hair and not just trying to lather up.Update 12/18: definitely adds volume. Hair is healthier looking too..

It isn’t better but, it’s on par with the fancy store-bought sulfate free shampoos out there. It’s worth the buy as a slightly more natural alternative.Full ReviewI used this shampoo for 4 days before writing this review.  My standard shampoo before this was an $8 store-bought sulfate free shampoo.  A bit of background. I have very, very… very dry hair that’s maybe a bit thinner than ideal, age 33 male. This was just as good as my old shampoo but not really better. My hair wasn’t improved. It seemed about the same to me.  This shampoo does have an immensely sweet scent.  That’s a plus or a minus depending on who you ask.  It was so sweet, I seriously felt like I needed to taste it… I didn’t because it’s shampoo, but I had a strong urge to drink it…Anyway, it does beat out the standard store shampoo due to its many natural ingredients. But, that’s only if you care about that type of thing. I’m a scientist… so I don’t… Oh well…But bottom line, a good shampoo worth buying. I would say."

They both smelled great. When I actually used them, they didn't feel as good as I had hope, and I kind of had a reaction to the product. My scalp, neck, ears, and face got red and hot. I don't think there was anything specific in the product that I'm usually sensitive to- it's just a really intense product. The ingredients are natural, but too much of a good thing isn't a good thing. Definitely don't use if you have sensitive skin!! It took an hour-long cold shower and lots of my old shampoo to get the product completely out and to calm my skin. I was really excited about this product, but it's definitely not for me."

113,"Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi Moisturizing Vegan Conditioner with Oils for Shiny Hair Silicone & SulfateFree Surfactant Aloe Conditioner to Hydrate Detangle Hair, Coconut, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,a natural shampoo that works,"I don’t know if it’s good or bad that my hair feels clean after I use this.  The obvious disadvantage to this is I have to use a conditioner, there’s no getting around it.  And like commercial brands of shampoo my hair still has some morning frizz.  However, the advantage is that I know it works.I have tried a LOT of natural shampoos and my hair doesn’t have that clean feel and can only go a day, maybe 2 before needing washed because it looks greasy.  This shampoo is natural but my hair feels clean, even after conditioner, and doesn’t get greasy again fast.  Yet my hair feels so soft, even days later, even the gray hair.  And I have reduced crazy fly aways (I still have mild fly away).It is a very thick shampoo so takes some practice to get the right amount.  It’s a pricey bottle as well but I can get away with the same amount of shampoo as if I used a commercial brand whereas most natural shampoos I have to use twice as much to even hope for a cleanliness to my hair so this lasts longer than other natural brands I’ve used, it makes up for the price.  It does not lather the same as commercial shampoos but it does lather the same or better than other natural brands.  It does not have to lather to work so don’t use more than you need.The smell is also amazing.  This is a definite win for a natural brand.  I will say that it does still have a long list of ingredients though."
114,"Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi Moisturizing Vegan Conditioner with Oils for Shiny Hair Silicone & SulfateFree Surfactant Aloe Conditioner to Hydrate Detangle Hair, Coconut, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Contains Toxic Ingredients,"There are many shampoos out there billing their products as vegan, animal-cruelty free, and/or organic.However, if you search the individual ingredients on Environmental Working Group's website, you'll find many -- like this one -- contain ingredients that cause reproductive harm or are environmental toxins or are carcinogenic if not thoroughly rinsed off the skin.The fact children, who are more susceptible to the harmful effects of toxins because of their smaller size and the fact their cells are still dividing and multiplying as they grow, are also using these products makes it evermore imperative the FDA or another government agency start regulating the cosmetics industry better.It's a shame these companies don't put more research into the so-called ""safer"" ingredients they use, to ensure they don't harm customers and/or the environment."
115,"Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi Moisturizing Vegan Conditioner with Oils for Shiny Hair Silicone & SulfateFree Surfactant Aloe Conditioner to Hydrate Detangle Hair, Coconut, 13 Fl Oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"We both liked using this shampoo. My wife said afterward her hair has fewer tangles than the shampoo she was using before. We both felt our hair was softer and more manageable – which isn’t a big feat for my short hair but it is for my wife’s medium to long hair. It smells good and is pleasant to use.The vegan claim may strike people as laughable since it seems silly that any animal products find their way into shampoo. I did some research finding out that it’s more than likely that non-vegan shampoos do contain some or even many animal products. It’s hardly a sure thing since US labeling requirements don’t identify animal-sourced items when there’s doubt with products that can be animal or non-animal derived.My wife’s a vegan so that this shampoo is free of animal parts scored big points with her. I have to agree. I’d prefer no animal products unless absolutely necessary. Since this shampoo does a great job and leaves the animals alone, it rates highly in our household."
116,"Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi Moisturizing Vegan Conditioner with Oils for Shiny Hair Silicone & SulfateFree Surfactant Aloe Conditioner to Hydrate Detangle Hair, Coconut, 13 Fl Oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have to admit I laughed at this shampoo having traveled to Amazon before arriving one island over (a 15 minute flight( on Oahu.  I am not sure how well known Awapuhi (locally known as shampoo ginger, for its' fragrant sap) is on the continent.  It is a ginger relative which produces large, cone shaped flowers (image attached) that release a fragrant liquid, I am not sure if it would properly be called sap, when squeezed.  It is often found when hiking in wet areas, and actually grows in standing water.  It is a much loved flower here, with a beautiful fragrance.  I had to see hgow well it translated.  As something of a fragrance fiend I have yet to find a gardenia perfume which smells anything like gardenia, or a jasmine which is really true (well, actually I have found the jasmine in s small British niche perfume) but it is difficult to find because flower essences are most often steam extracted which leaves them smelling cooked, not much like the flower.  Awapuhi is different because of the abundance of fragrant liquid (sap?) and Maui Moisture seems to have captured it well!  The scent is true, it is strong and really a lovely fragrance.  That is where the 4 stars comes from.  Actually, I would give the fragrance 5 stars.  It is very well done.The shampoo I was less happy with.  For one, the bottle is not sealed.  I am frankly surprised UPS delivered it.  It was leaking so badly that the envelope it was shipped in was soaked and dripping.  Something which has to travel as far as this does really ought to have the bottle sealed.The shampoo is an odd combination of ingredients for shampoo.  The first ingredient is aloe vera, which suddenly seems to be in everything.  It is abundant, and cheap.  A friend gave me a plant about 15 years ago.  I now have hundreds, despite donating hundreds each year to my kids' school carnival.  Aloe is actually an astringent.  It is typically applied to burns.  The sap is thick and sticky.  I do not know why anyone would want to put it in their hair.  I am actually allergic to aloe, so I gave this shampoo to my daughter to test.  She has several feet of hair and is very particular about what she uses.  No doubt she was delighted by the natural ingredients, and also the avapuhi.  The shampoo also contains coconut milk, which is also everywhere.  I am very glad the shampoo does not smell like coconut, which I am personally sick of, and makes me think of cheap tourist sunscreen.  That said, you do not get that feel from this shampoo.  Coconut is fatty, and much better for your hair or skin than your body. (Nutritionists says not to consume it ever because of the high saturated fats).  That said, the oil is a lot mkore moisturizing than the milk, so it was sort of an odd choice.  I am not seeing where the moisture comes from.  The scent is wonderful, but I am less happy with it as a shampoo.  It is something my daughter and I both may not notice as we use conditioner, but the ingredients are not especially moistruizing.  This is not a shampoo I would use without conditioner, but it will not strip your hair either like a lot of shampoos do.The ingredients are natural, a huge plus.  The scent is lovely, really well done here.,  Those who know awapuhi will be impressed, those who don't ought to be delighted by the scent.  I rated it 4 stars because it is all natural and the fragrance is lovely but it is not the best shampooo I have used, and they really do need to seal the bottles so that they can travel safely thousands of miles by air."
117,"Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi Moisturizing Vegan Conditioner with Oils for Shiny Hair Silicone & SulfateFree Surfactant Aloe Conditioner to Hydrate Detangle Hair, Coconut, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,pretty decent shampoo,"EDIT / UPDATE:  I tried this shampoo again and didn't follow it with the Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate Shea Butter conditioner, and had good results.  So it's the conditioner that wreaks havoc on my hair, turning it dry and straw-like.But definintely CAN use this Maui shine shampoo with a different conditioner and my hair is definitely soft and ""light"" feeling, so I do recommend this shampoo!****************************************'Well this was an odd experience (btw, I purchased mine at Target).  I have some natural wave to my hair, but can also easily straighten it.  Seems kind ""average"" hair.This shampoo, along with the Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate Shea Butter conditioner, were a really bad combo for my hair.  Even using the conditioner, my hair didn't feel soft at all while I was conditioning it.  It felt soft of 'dry' and straw-like.I've only used this combo twice but am giving both products away because at first I thought it was a fluke that my hair felt so coarse and straw-like.  A couple of weeks later I used both products again and nope.  Bad idea.  My hair is coarse today and very very dry  (the day after using these).Seems odd since these are both supposed to be moisturizing.  And I have great results with Dove Moisture products and Aussie and Redken, as well as a host of others.  Anyway, just didn't work for me."

Aloe Vera is the first ingredient, which means the consistency is alot like, well, aloe vera.  Clear, a bit slimy and comes out in glurp of shampoo. I loved scent of the shampoo, which has ginger and florals.  I will say that after the shampo, my hair was very tangly and conditioning was an absolute must.  I  liked this shampoo enough that I will likely purchase the conditioner.Would give 5 stars, but some of the ingredients are still too chemicall-y for the natural/vegan branding of this shampoo."

Hawai’i. The awapuhi smells genuine, and the label gets it right when it states that the awapuhi flower is generally used in shampoos. It feels authentic, and there is just so much that this product gets right.One of the good things about this product is the fact that it is sulfate free. Even more so, it is free from parabens, silicones, and dyes, all the while maintaining a vegan label. Supposedly it detangles and hydrates hair, but so far, I’ve only experienced the hydration. When kept long, my hair notoriously tangles often, so I had rather high hopes when I saw this one advertising to combat that. While it hasn’t helped with the one issue, at least my hair isn’t as staticky as it used to be anymore due to the increase in hydration.The only real gripe I have is with the protective seal, or really, lack thereof. When the shampoo arrived, I was saddened by the sight of an exploded bottled - half the content was sludging about in the bag. If you’re actually purchasing your own bottles, then this is unacceptable. Perhaps having a small piece of tape would be enough to combat the abuse experienced during delivery. Otherwise, again, this is unacceptable when it seems to be a prevalent issue mentioned throughout reviews."

It is usually visibly tangled, wavy, and dull, but this shampoo makes it straight and shiny. My hair used to look so damaged, because it wasn't fully straight, but also not completely wavy. It was always a mess and I had to brush it every hour. It was dull and course to the touch, and you couldn't even run your hand through it. My scalp was also irritated (possibly from my last shampoo). Now, my hair feels light and soft, and so much less dull. It gets tangled way less easily, and my flyaways and split ends have calmed down.  This shampoo relaxes my tight curls and gives my hair soft waves. Hair looks healthy and still has good volume despite how moisturizing the shampoo is. I can go a few days without washing my hair before it becomes greasy.  The smell is great, doesn't smell too powerful or artificial."

DMDM is not listed anywhere in the ingredient list even under its most common name glydant. no this won’t make your hair fall out. do some research ppl the amount of DMDM used in most cosmetic products is minimal. also a company like maui would get a big lawsuit if they used a harsh preservative like that since they pride themselves on being vegan/natural

It comes in something that looks like a yogurt or fruit drink, and it also smells like fruit punch! Keep it away from the young kids. The shampoo has a thick consistency. I had to either wait or squeeze it out slowly. It does a wonderful job cleaning my hair and lathers generously. You don't need to use much to get the job done. It really smells like a fruit drink.  After rinsing it off with water, the hair is clean but becomes lumpy and stiff. I had to finish it off with a conditioner, which ended up smothering the strong fruit scent.  A few hours later, my hair still feels very clean and my scalp is not dried out as before. This Maui shampoo doesn't dry out the scalp! I'm very impressed."

It keeps my hair shiny and really can feel the clearness. In the other word, the condition is a must after using Maui moisture shine vegan shampoo. Otherwise the next day my medium length hair would be tangled and fuzzy. This is a small bottle (13 oz) with the price over $10, I may use it with other cheaper shampoo so it would not runs out too fast."

I have a daughter with very curly, and very dry hair...that being said she also spends a lot of time outside and in the dirt. This makes something that actually still cleans a MUST in our house. This works really well. I am impressed with how little frizz we are seeing in her hair now. We definitely still need conditioner, but this is a really awesome base that cleans well. My big complaint is that it is a bit strong in the scent department, but it does tame nicely as you rinse and then your hair dries. Great option for those who want to buy a greener product, but are afraid it won't clean well. This definitely will!"

So when I choose my daily shampoo I do extra research to see if the companies put anything bad ingredients in to the shampoo/treatment. I chose this shampoo because This Maui shampoo is Free from silicones, sulfated surfactants, parabens, mineral oil, gluten and synthetic dye, this shampoo is vegan! How awesome is that. It’s been about a week and half now since I started using this shampoo. My scalp is clean, my hair is shiner than ever! I would highly recommend this shampoo to anyone!"
126,"Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi Moisturizing Vegan Conditioner with Oils for Shiny Hair Silicone & SulfateFree Surfactant Aloe Conditioner to Hydrate Detangle Hair, Coconut, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pricy but lovely sulfate-free shampoo,"The only thing not to like is the price. I have to use a lot of this product for my shoulder-length hair (like the size of a ping-pong ball), and it takes more work to get a nice lather than a product with sulfates. However, it is possible to work up a beautiful lather, and the smell is lovely. For me, the bottle will last about 10 shampooings.  This does allow me to go a few days between shampoos so the bottle is about a month's supply.  The shampoo is moisturizing, but a conditioner is mandatory. After rinsing and before shampooing, my hair is extremely snarly and hard to comb through. But adding a conditioner makes this really work. My hair is shiny and bouncy and good smelling with this product."

I was excited about this one because its supposed to have great slip when washing which is crucial for detangling my curls. Instead of it being a fluid liquid like most other shampoos, this one came out like a thick gel consistency which lathered well. I didn’t need much to wash my hair and it left my hair feeling a little too squeaky clean but not completely stripped. It did nothing for detangling my hair, because it left it so clean I had to gently detangle afterwards with my conditioner. It smells really nice and the scent only slightly lingers on the hair."

Sulfate free, but with c14-16 sulfonate as a clarifying cleanser. Thorough but non stripping cleansing shampoo.  With curly hair, I use gobs of conditioner no matter what.  I loosely follow the Curly Girl Method, and this shampoo fits the bill.  No sulfates, no silicones, no drying alcohols.  Great shampoo, my hair is soft, shiny, and clean feeling.  No straw like drying or super frizz. Nice to have another shampoo available."

The shampoo is a pretty thick gel like consistency and it bubbles quite easily.The scent is a nice, fresh, citrus-y, fruity scent that I can't really identify what it is. It's not too strong, just right.It's quite nice though! The shampoo left my straight, mid-back length hair really soft and also feeling squeaky clean. I really like this shampoo and will continue using this for a while to see if it improves hair health."

It's light, but delicious.  The shampoo lathers up nicely, and rinses out without leaving any leftover residue.  After using my hair was a little frizzier than when I use my normal shampoo.  My hair didn't become greasy and in need of another washing until 3 days later which is pretty good.  I've used it several times and I'm going to keep using it, and see how it goes."

It made my hair feel way cleaner than with the Pantene shampoo I normally use and the smell is awesome! I had my 9 year old use it as well since her hair gets greasy looking after just two days and it’s helped her hair a lot to stay fresh and clean looking as well. I hope to get the conditioner soon to try that out as well. I love that it doesn’t include bad parabens and all that junk other brands use that are bad for hair and that it’s not tested on animals. Over all I highly recommend!

It smells amazing and fresh. Softening and moisturizing. A bit of a shine. I'll keep using it and update since I've only used it once so far. It's not meant to create a ton of suds since it doesn't have all the chemicals. It's a translucent shampoo.

It isn’t better but, it’s on par with the fancy store-bought sulfate free shampoos out there. It’s worth the buy as a slightly more natural alternative.Full ReviewI used this shampoo for 4 days before writing this review.  My standard shampoo before this was an $8 store-bought sulfate free shampoo.  A bit of background. I have very, very… very dry hair that’s maybe a bit thinner than ideal, age 33 male. This was just as good as my old shampoo but not really better. My hair wasn’t improved. It seemed about the same to me.  This shampoo does have an immensely sweet scent.  That’s a plus or a minus depending on who you ask.  It was so sweet, I seriously felt like I needed to taste it… I didn’t because it’s shampoo, but I had a strong urge to drink it…Anyway, it does beat out the standard store shampoo due to its many natural ingredients. But, that’s only if you care about that type of thing. I’m a scientist… so I don’t… Oh well…But bottom line, a good shampoo worth buying. I would say."

It gets pretty frizzy/flyaway. She's 8 so we don't use any heat styling tools and she's not crazy about putting in products. So shampoo is what we've got to help those curls and tame the flyaway frizz. The smell of this shampoo is great in a sweet-smelling way. She seemed to have more definition in her curls, but she also seems like she has more frizz/flyaways.

This was okay for my hair, but it wasn't the best.Enter this product (recommended to me by another curly friend). I now wash with this , follow it with an herbal rinse, then use a Maui Moisture hair butter to detangle and style my hair. I like the way the shampoo makes my hair feel. It's clean but it's still moisturized. A fair word of warning-- I did use this after doing an oil treatment once and it did NOT get all the oil out. Be mindful of that. You may need something more powerful. However, since I started using this shampoo, I no longer feel the need to pre-poo with oil. Love this stuff!"

I read the reviews and as someone with long, thick, curly hair I thought I’d give it a go. I can get away with using both the products I mentioned without their partner conditioners and am always fairly pleased to find tangles are still not a war. Of course to dbl down the Shea Moisture Curl & Shine Conditioner is a staple in my house, but THIS product was not nearly the moisturizing I thought it might be based on reviews, and though the scent was nice I was disappointed at the difference I noticed when trying to detangle - ouch! Won’t purchase again, and by the 3rd wash I knew there wouldn’t be a 4th."
4,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Shampoo to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Shampoo, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the shampoo very much,I think this item was discontinued because I can't find it in the stores here in Florida.  I like the shampoo very much.  I have very wavy hair that is also highlighted.  I just find it doesn't strip my hair and leaves it feeling clean.  I have to wash my hair everyday so this is a nice product.  I hope it wasn't discontinued because I like it a lot.  The shampoo doesn't have a scent or if it does it is very light so if you want a perfumy smelling shampoo this isn't for you.  I like this product a lot.

6,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Shampoo to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Shampoo, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Clean & simple on 4C,Shampoo + conditioner + hair milk = for me extreme coils!  I would recommend to barely use the hair milk it’s very oily lotion but keeps your scalp wet and moist. Over 1-2 hours the hair/curls is dry looking as in no shine and brittle to touch. Overall - hair is very soft and tangle free. I am looking for a more two strand hair twist approach to make waves so I will not use the milk as it creates coils and shrinkage.

8,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Shampoo to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Shampoo, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Scam?,"The item spilled (both conditioners) they smell nothing like my previous shampoo and conditioner. To top it off, the shampoo seems to have been usedI don’t recommend this seller or their products, feels like a scam. Wish I took proper photos before washing them, but even the bottle caps had some of the goo in closed spaces looking like it was possibly used."
9,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Shampoo to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Shampoo, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best out there but works in a pinch,"About 2 years ago, I began using the curly girl method on my hair and stopped using heat of any kind. Unfortunately, many of the natural shampoos and conditioners can be quite expensive, so I like to purchase this brand shampoo from time to time. Other reviews were stating this shampoo made their hair hard to comb, but using this with some kinky curly knot today conditioner made my 2c/3a curls soft and manageable. I lightly dry my hair and scrunch argan and jojoba oil into my hair for an easy wash and go style. This shampoo is great if you're on a budget or just to hold you over until you can buy a more expensive brand. It's not the best out there for sure, but it works. It smells pretty good and works better on my hair than devacurl, to be honest."

My hair is now like it was when I was 3-4 yrs old. Most of my life I had either straight with some wave or just frizzy hair. I love my hair being curly but had to find a shampoo to help support that.

And the curls you get right after washing are simply beautiful. You don’t have to use much product for superior results, so even though the bottle looks small it’s lasts a while. I’ve spent twice as much and not been as satisfied I am wondering if perhaps it is a Aloe base that makes it so Lansing. It’s my absolute new favorite thing and I highly recommend."

I have a lot of different textures to my head from 2A to 4B so I decided to test the product out on my cousins hair first. They have 4B/4C high porosity hair and it cleaned their hair well without leaving it super dry. I had hoped it would do the same for mine. However, it did not. It left my hair dry and brittle and I lost tons of hair and left my hair squeaky clean. I was very disappointed."

I didn't know what formula to buy since my hair seemed to fit none of the categories they describe on the bottle, but I ended up choosing the one for curly hair.  My hair is normally wavy to slightly curly but lately it had been flat and droopy.  I have long hair.  Since I've been using this shampoo, my hair is easier to brush even days after washing it.  It doesn't get dirty as quickly any more, either.  The shampoo smells like paradise.  My hair is softer, shinier & has a lot more volume using this shampoo.  It's super thick & somewhat hard to get out of the bottle.  I will continue using this brand but I may experiment with some of the other formulas to see how they are.  Overall, I really like it a lot."

I have very long, very thick, 3C curls that absolutely love the Hask shampoo & conditioner. But I thought I'd try something new and picked up some of this at a competing brick and mortar store.Within two washings it was obvious that this stuff does not do the same job. Now my curls are limp, my roots are flat, and I need a massive amount of hair lotion after I get out of the shower to tame the frizz. I used to only put a tiny amount of hair lotion in after showering to help keep the frizzies at bay! Not only am I severely disappointed with how this product has performed for me, but I realize that its costing me more as well because I have to use more than the Hask Curl S&C to get my hair clean, and to spread the conditioner through this massive amount of hair. For some reason this Maui stuff is stupid thick! So thick that it's hard to drag through my hair, and takes longer to rinse out. And then I have to use more hair lotion afterwards because of the frizz issue, also eating into my pocketbook that much more.Scent-wise, both products I compared smell nice, but I did prefer the scent of the Hask over this Maui. However if the Maui performed better, the scent of the Hask wouldn't have been enough alone for me to switch back.Plain and simple, when comparing to Hask curl products, Hask wins hands-down! I do not like the Maui curl products because they weigh my hair down, do not keep frizz away,  and are so ridiculously thick that they are hard to work through my hair."

It's amazing!,"Here is the truth. I am a product snob. I buy and try everything it's genuinely a joke.I was paying for the huge bottles of Pureology and my hair dresser was constantly giving me ""moisture treatments"" because my hair was so brittle and dry.This shampoo and its sister conditioner is so great for my hair it's ridiculous.Not kidding, I found this product and used it daily on my highlighted and color treated hair (which I pay a small fortune for) and my hair dresser was amazed! It leaves my hair so soft and I don't need anti frizz product. I have fine hair but a lot of it it. It's also pretty straight with a little curl that gets frizzy. The moisture is incredible. I'm not getting paid for this review."

BUT after using this shampoo and conditioner combo for the length of time that it took to finish the bottles (3 months or so), it sucks.Darn.I wanted to like this so badly but it leaves my hair feeling like candle wax. It’s knotty and rough feeling. Not smooth and silky by any means.One thing it does do is add volume, but I think that volume is all just build-up. I switched to Bed Head and it removed all the stuff this left behind."

I actually used the chart that Maui Moisture had to determine which kind is suitable for me. I picked the curl quench coconut oil and it’s in the middle range for moisture level but don’t be fooled on how moisturizing this duo is.

I was using this conditioner exclusively as a conditioner and a leave in for my curls. It was amazing a year and a half ago, since then I have lost SO MUCH HAIR. Especially around my hair line. I’m talking chunks of hair in the shower. My sister started using the product about a year ago and when I told her she said the same thing. My hair was so thick y’all. It’s thin now. My curls won’t last longer than one day. If I sleep on them, forget about it. Please stop using this. I don’t know what the next product is but this is garbage. Look it up on the ThinkDirty app"

They use to use non toxic ingredients 4 years ago but now it's gone down the drain, just like my hair!!. I lost so much hair due to postpartum and I was so happy I finally got my hair back, until I switched hair products and started using Maui Moisture again. When I started using them I noticed my hair was coming out in chunks!!! I regret trying these curly products again. They contain Diazolidinyl Urea, DMDM and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate. Two of these ingredients are Formaldehyde Releasers and the other is a toxic preservative that’s used in paint and wood industries. Please stay away. Don't take the risk its so not worth it."

I have naturally curly hair, around 3B/3C hair and my biggest issue is my hair tends to be on the dry side so I need the products I use to moisturize, and reduce frizz. This product dried out my hair, caused so much frizz my curls lasted hrs and then got so tangled it was horrible to manage. When I try a product I go all out. I tried all together, the shampoo and conditioner, the curl smoothie and the curl milk. Now my hair is falling out in clumps. I have changed products to the one i used previously which was ogx coconut Curls until my hair is better to try another one. The problem I have with OGX is that the products make my hair greesy. The complete opposite problem. Beware when using this product as it does the opposite of what it intends. I ignored the bad reviews, and I regret it."

My 4yr old also has curly hair so I used it on her this morning to see if it was specific to my hair, it wasn’t. I normally use Baby Organics on her hair and when I used this, her hair felt dry as well.  This smells great but it is not a fit for me"

It’s not overly dry, but enough to need more moisture from conditioners. This, however, was not the way to go for me. I got the regular’ole conditioner. AS SOON as it touches my hair it feels like it’s STRIPPING it, not moisturizing it. Not to mention it makes my hair even harder to detangle because it’s not creamy and moisturizing. I’ve tried it a handful of times now and it’s dissatisfying. The smell is verrrrrry strong; too strong for me. It’s not awful, but it is a punch in the face lol. I’m wondering if the result of this conditioner is because of the kind I got? Instead of the quencher I think I’ll try the leave-in conditioner from this brand. If you like a weightless feel in your hair and don’t already struggle to detangle your hair, you’d probably like this. But if you want to FEEL the moisturization and help with detangling, this ain’t it."

It makes my curls feel like straw, and it seems to encourage my hair to tangle. It smells amazingly good, but I can't give it more than one star because it feels I have actively damaged my hair by trying this product. And anyway, why does it have so many different types of alcohol in the ingredient list? I bought this because it was advertised as silicone-free, but I compared the label to a conditioner I already had on hand that does have silicones-- this one has more ingredients containing alcohol than that one does. I've done enough reading up on curly hair to know it's not accurate to consider all alcohols as drying, but since this literally does not condition my hair at all, I think these ingredients must be part of the problem. Weird and bad."

My hair has 2b, 2c, and 3a curls. I recently had protein/product overload which I got from adding to many protein boosting products in my hair. Long story short: I got brittle hair.

It's amazing! So rich. My hair tends to eat conditioners for breakfast and be hungry for more by lunch, especially in the dry winter months, so this is perfect. My hair has a great volume too, so it's not greasy, just creamy and thick and rich. My hair feels less frizzy, too. This is my new winter conditioner.

It got so dehydrated that my stylist even accused me of incorrectly coloring my own hair. I accidentally found this in the grocery store one day, knew I  had nothing to lose, so decided to try it.  It's been my conditioner of choice ever since. My hair is soft, but never oily, easy to style either with big manageable waves, or tight curly curls!

I was not expecting much since it was so cost saving, but I was so surprised at how fabulous it made my hair! My hair was so much softer and it enhanced my curls, as it said it would. No more high-priced professional products for me. I've been using it for about 3 months. Great product!!"

For rinse-out conditioners like this one, I first brush my (thick, coarse) hair, and apply the conditioner to it while it's dry. I run it all the way through my hair, saturating it from root to tip using only my fingers, then wrap it up into a towel and let it set for at least an hour. I then jump into the shower and rinse it out. I do this, generally, about once or twice a week. Doing this process with this conditioner left it feeling really clean and really good, like I'd just shampooed it with its matching shampoo, and that's not something I can say about many of the conditioners I've used."

63,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Conditioner to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Conditioner, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,No better than Tresemme or Garnier,"Idk if it is just me or what, but this product isn't as great as the first time I used it. I bought a bottle from Target a few months ago because the packaging was cute and it said it was for ""thick, curly hair"" (I have 3B/3C hair for those that hair type). I was skeptical but OMG!! It worked so well. It was super thick and creamy and it left my hair feeling super soft and moisturized. I used it as a leave-in/styler. However, I recently ordered 3 bottles online through amazon and I just don't like the product anymore. To me it just does not feel like it is the same product. It isn't as thick or creamy and the consistency is more like Tresemme :/There's nothing wrong with Tresemme, but I could buy a bigger bottle for a cheaper price if that's what I wanted.I have since used 2 of the 3 bottles and I am just NOT impressed. I gave it 3 stars because it smells good but it is just like any other conditioner now. I know a lot of brands that claim to cater to thick and curly hair are changing their formulas to appeal to people with looser hair textures. I hope this isn't the case for this brand because I was a faithful customer after my first bottle. However, I don't think I'll be getting these anymore since it does nothing more than what a Tresemme conditioner could do."

242,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Conditioner to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Conditioner, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,PURE GARBAGE,"0 stars! This is the worst product I’ve ever used. It leaves my hair so tangled, knotty, course and dry that I cannot comb through it! And when I finally do I’ve lost clumps of hair. The worst part is that my hair doesn’t even feel clean after I’ve used it. I can’t run my fingers through it because it feels so greasy and matted down. How in the world is this marketed to moisturize hair? Suave for 0.99 does a way better job! The packaging is terrible too. The shape of the bottle paired with the thickness of the product makes it so difficult to dispense. It does smell good (its only saving grace) but the scent doesn’t last beyond the shower. Disappointing is an understatement."
243,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Conditioner to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Conditioner, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Made my curls limp, frizzy and dry",I picked this up at CVS but I'm leaving a review here because I often use my amazon app to gauge how good a product is before i buy it.While using this system my curls felt like straw. They were frizzer than normal (which is saying something) and my curls were loose almost wavy when I normally have medium/tight curls. Ive used about half of the bottles I purchased and Ive given up. I can't justify putting my hair through this just not to waste the money spent on this product.
244,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Conditioner to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Conditioner, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product...without sulfates or silicone!,"It is a challenge finding products without sulfate or silicone that also address the need to moisturize and protect hair effectively. This is a wonderful product, particularly for curly hair. Smells delicious! However, it is surprising that it is less than half the price at Target. I will continue to purchase this product, as well as continue to recommend to colleagues and friends!"

I like how my hair feels. I like how easy it is to style my hair. The smell is amazing. It's not at all oily or greasy to the touch after it's applied. I'm going to get them all.
246,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Conditioner to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Conditioner, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what it seems,"I wanted to try this product again and figured that curl quench would help my thick curly hair find the moisture it needs. Again, another let down. I was so hoping this product was going to work but it leaves my hair feeling even more drier than it is lately due to the cold weather. I figure they put fancy ingredients to make it seem like it would work better. It's not any better than the commercial products. Nothing special about it. So disappointed."
247,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Conditioner to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Conditioner, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best,"I've been using this conditioner for about 6 months now.

The scent was pleasant. However, there was something about this conditioner that I didnt find appealing: it wasnt thick enough for me. It seemed thin. This isn't a bad conditioner but it would not be my first pick. I would say it comes in second behind Aussie Moisture."

Anything super heavy will weight my hair down and my scalp turns into a grease pit. I love how what this shampoo and conditioner duo does for my thin hair. My hair felt so soft right out the shower and it detangles so easily. I’ve tried many shampoos/conditioners before but this is by far my favorite brand. I actually used the chart that Maui Moisture had to determine which kind is suitable for me. I picked the curl quench coconut oil and it’s in the middle range for moisture level but don’t be fooled on how moisturizing this duo is. I think this is amazing considering I paid 30 plus for other terrible brands."

282,"Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut Oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Conditioner to Hydrate and Detangle Tight Curly Hair, Softening Conditioner, Vegan, Silicone & Paraben-Free, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Moisturizing,"I started using this line while going through a major hair transition. I started struggling with my 3c hair two years ago at 21 and at 23 I decided to change up my shampoo and conditioner after using SheaMoisture for 6 years. The immediate result was less damaged ends, but my hair texture absolutely changed from 3c to 3A. I thought it could be due to the heaviness of the conditioner so I switched to their Flaxseed conditioner and found it restored the definition of my curls while still massively hydrating. My one critique of this product is that it can lead to buildup when using ONLY the for thick curly hair system. I suggest clarifying with one of their stronger shampoos every two or three washes because the shampoo is very weak. I personally like the hibiscus (pink bottle) for clarifying."

It smells good but that’s the only good thing about this. I am not sure if the formula changed or what but this absolutely did the opposite of what it claims. My hair couldn’t get detangled or moisturized so matter how much or little I used. I lost so much hair I was literally crying, I never seen so much of my hair lost while conditioning or detangling. I felt that I was better off using a shampoo. It made my hair so thin."

El aroma es muy rico y con muy poquito te alcanza para todo el cabello. También lo he usado disuelto en agua en un atomizador para hidratar las puntas de mi cabello los días que no me lo lavo y funciona de maravilla, no lo deja grasoso y quita el frizz. Lo único es que si tienes muy poco cabello o muy finito podría dejártelo pesado como dicen otras reseñas, pero fuera de eso 100% recomendado"

0,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Gentle, smells nice, lightweight for those of us with oily scalps","For reference, I have 1B hair, thick, pretty straight and never dyed it in my life. My scalp gets oily and therefore I lack volume. My scalp is also prone to irritation so it’s hard to find a shampoo that cleans without stripping and weighing it down. Alas, this is a nice shampoo to use and is lightweight. It imparts a pleasant and non overpowering smell also, whilst it doesn’t contribute to irritation in any way. Super gentle."
1,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing,"I love the fragrance of this, it smells so good. The only bummer was that it arrived with a chunk of the cap broken. It was sealed within its own bag, and not too much product leaked out but still, I hope they're more careful next time with packaging."
2,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,HOLY GRAIL!!!! Low porosity life saver!!,"I've tried so many products from Olaplex to every natural/sulfate free shampoo and conditioner to mend my super dry low porosity hair (I don't color, I barely use heat, but my ends get so dry and have breakage from previous keratin treatments) and within ONE wash - my hair literally went from feeling dead and dry from the neck down to being the softest and healthiest my hair has ever felt all the way down to my ends!!! It has so much life and movement - all the dryness and frizz are GONE. Literally can't believe the results for the price, it feels like my hair went through a $200 conditioning treatment I'm obsessed!!!!"
3,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best choice made in 2020!,"I used Pantene ProV for year. My hair would always feel heavy a day after shampooing. I noticed my hair would fall out more frequently and became lack luster. I changed over to this product November 2020 and haven’t looked back since. This was the best change my hair needed speaking directly a 40year old woman. Hair doesn’t fall out as much, it feels lighter and I can go 3-4 days without washing and it smells fantastic!"
4,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to like this way more than I do, but...","I was looking for a new shampoo and conditioner because even though my old one worked well for me (Hair Food: coconut & chai), I get bored and want new scents. My cousin recommended me this brand.I wanted to like this way more than I do, but the scent just doesn't do it for me. I definitely thought it would smell more watermelon-y, which I would have loved, but it has a weird scent to it that just doesn't appeal to me. It isn't BAD, just not my favorite.While it does make my hair feel and look nice, it's back to falling out a ton. The ONLY shampoo/conditioner that I haven't had that happen on was my Hair Food one, so I guess I'm just going to go back to that one."
5,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Too thick, gave me bad dandruff, horrid product","I've been using clean products for about a year now, still trying to find a curly hair friendly shampoo that doesn't weigh it down. This shampoo has amazing reviews... How???First off it's so thick it's difficult to get out of the bottle, let alone get it to stay on my hair. It slips right off.Second, everything about my hair and scalp were fine. I just wanted to find a better shampoo... This shampoo is the only thing I changed in my routine and it gave me horrible dandruff. Like, burning itching, redness."
6,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Gave this an honest try, but it's a no.","I used this product for two months before writing this review, because I really, really wanted to like it. But I can't. Since I started using this product - the only change I've made - my hair has become dryer, doesn't look clean for as long as it used to, and has been knotting more. The skin along my hairline and wear my hair touches has also been getting more acne than it used to. You can find better shampoo for the same price, if not cheaper. The only thing it has going for it is its smell."
7,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for oily scalps,"When I read ""lightweight hydration"" I thought this would be great for my oily scalp and dry ends but unfortunately, this shampoo is pretty terrible at getting my hair clean.And I have been using this for a few weeks now, testing it as much as I could. I've used a method where I lather and apply to my scalp and then add more to my ends to get rid of build up. It still didn't get my hair clean.The thing is, if you have an oily scalp and sulfates don't necessarily bother you or irritate your skin, then you might as well go for a shampoo that has sulfates because it does help in cleaning and getting rid of excess oil.I would recommend this for people with normal to dry hair. If you have an oily scalp that's prone to build up like mine, this shampoo won't help."
8,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"Very nice and lightweight for my straight and low porosity hair. A lot of the other shampoos I've tried is either very heavy or gives me a product buildup. This is one of the few shampoos that works well with my hair. It is sulfate-free. While this is great, if you do not use enough water, it can be difficult to use. It can create buildup. But if you saturate your hair enough, it should be okay."
9,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair dry,Ive been using this shampoo for over a month now and i thought i liked it at first but i've realized my hair has become BEYOND dry/frizzy after drying from this shampoo. To deal with this problem i've been using the Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil leave-in-conditioner so i think im going to switch to that brand of shampoo/conditioner and see what happens.
10,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to leave a lot of oil behind,"My hair builds up oil pretty quickly, so I chose the less moisturizing end of the Maui Moisture spectrum when I chose this shampoo, thinking it would do well with removing dirt and oil.Not really. It seems to leave a bit of a slippery film behind, which made my hair feel kind of sticky and not entirely clean.The smell is lovely, and that's about all I liked about it. I used the rest as a body wash."
11,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Consistency feels off. Like gel,"I usually buy this shampoo in store, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to order off of Amazon. Shampoo came in and as I tried to squeeze it out of the bottle, it came out in a harder consistency than normal, almost like gel. It doesn’t not prevent my hair from being greasy the next day like it normally does. Not sure if my bottle is expired or made incorrectly. disappointed though."
12,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,not good for wavy hair,"i really wanted to love this, it was recommended to me because it’s supposed to be good for wavy/curly hair. at first it was okay but the more i kept using it the more it weighed down my hair and made my hair dry straight. my hair got super dry and knotted super easily with this. the scent is nice but the texture makes it super hard to rub together"
13,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,"I have thin, fine, damaged, highlighted hair. This shampoo and conditioner as a set works very well to hydrate my dry ends while cleaning my scalp and hair. I do have an oily scalp which makes it hard to find a good enough shampoo that will clean my hair but not over strip it. This is a perfect balance! The scent is also really subtle but nice!"
14,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not reccomend!!!,This product made a lot of my hair fall out and overall very dry.
15,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This shampoo is WORTH IT, but shipping issues","GREAT shampoo! I have curly, fine hair and it is so hard to find something that is truly LIGHTWEIGHT moisture and this is it. It always sells out in my local stores so I ordered it this time- this shampoo is that good. 12/10 on the poo, However! My bottle was half empty due to spilling while shipping. Hopefully they get something figured out because spending that much on half a bottle of shampoo isn't my jam."
16,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fine Wavy Blonde hair,"This product has an amazing fragrance. I bought this to try something new for my fine, wavy, and highlighted hair. I’m working on my routine of the curly girl method. So far this product has been great for my 2A/2B low porosity hair. I use a moisturizing mask made by them as well. I didn’t want to spend a bunch of money trying new things and this has a great price point."
17,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,No more fog on my hair!,I have used a lot of different types of shampoos. I have silver colored hair and all the shampoos I’ve tried have all left my hair a dirty yellow cast. My granddaughter ask me to try her shampoo (this brand) and I loved the way it made my hair feel and look. I had a hard time finding it in the stores and was delighted when I found I could order it on line. I love it!!! No more foggy film!  Everyone that I see in the stores or in public tell me they love my hair. Thanks to the wonderful people that listen.... we don’t like a fog on our hair...we want our hair color to shine!!!!!
18,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy curls..,"I have tried SO many products, and brands and nothing has done my curls quite as good as Maui Moisture. My hair is soft, shiny, bouncy, defined. So happy with the results. And at the price point?? It doesn’t get any better. Used with the matching conditioner, coconut curl cream, and the new mousse. *MUAH* CHEFS KISS"

20,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as expected,"Didnt feel like it cleaned my hair at all. Hair still felt greasy and had to use a diff shampoo after.. Not very strong smelling, so I was disappointed."
21,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Maui Moisture Lightweight,I’ve only used it once but the scent is rather pleasing.

The box itself was in excellent condition along with the plastic air pockets used to protect the order. But, the bottle of shampoo opened and was only 1/2 full upon arrival. Shampoo was seeping through the clear  plastic bag it was packed in. I have to say this order gave me a frustrating start from the get go. The conditioner arrived within a day but it took well over a week to receive 1/2 a bottle of shampoo."

I tried it & love the smell, but within a day or two of using it, I started to notice my hair was falling out! I kept using the products because I wasn't sure exactly what caused the hair loss, but by the time I got halfway through the small bottle (maybe 3 weeks use), I had a noticeable bald spot right above my temple! I stopped using these products & switched to a different brand and within a few days noticed that the hair loss has greatly diminished. I'm not sure if this was an anomaly with my skin/hair, but buyer beware!"
114,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 10 REVIEWER,"Reading reviews for personal care products can be a challenge as far as figuring out if the product will help you or not. Like food, comes down to personal preference, and no one will have exact same experience or impression because we all have different hair types and needs. Here are my thoughts on this product, and I will start with what my hair is like to begin with.My hair: DRY, prone to frizz, waist length, healthy, mix of waves and curls (lots of waves because of hair length). Not dyed/colored has some silver at temples. Mid 40s.Lifestyle: I rely on dry shampoo and detangler. My hair is always a tangled mess, and always made worse since I dont comb it daily, nor wash it daily. I'm not too picky about shampoo or conditioner, so long as it doesnt weigh it down nor leave it feeling like straw.THIS particular shampoo and conditioner set is formulated for ""all hair types"". That made me assume that it will likely clean my hair but do minimal job on hydrating it. I find my assumption accurate. HOWEVER, it had a few positive aspects, one in particular (read way below), that really impressed me. I will explain:-- great aroma. Just a pleasant spring/summer scent.--attractive bottles, but takes a little extra oomph to get the shampoo out because it is a gel--large enough lettering for me to see! My eyes have gotten bad in terms of small lettering. Once I realized that I cant read a shampoo bottle like I used to, it became a point that I would bring up in my reviews (solidarity for my far sighted friends)--cleans the hair well.--->> I start by thoroughly wetting my hair. Then I add a little shampoo. As with most sulfate free shampoo there wont be much lather to start. I dont use a lot to start because I know that the initial application is really just to help break down the grime of the day. So feel free to use a little, let it sit for like 30 seconds or so, then rinse or just add a little more water, then add more shampoo. Feel the lather explode! This will now finish off the cleansing. Very nice.--->> After I rinse, and wring out excess water, I add a generous amount of conditioner. Let sit 3-5 minutes. I think I went no more than 3 minutes. Then rinsed. I could tell that my hair felt kinda slick and smooth as I rinsed. I half wondered if this would weigh down my hair.--->> Afterward, and this is the point that totally WOWED me.. let me back up.. I had used a ton of dry shampoo (couple days worth), plus a hair texturizer (to further give limp dirty hair a boost), and hadn't combed it in a couple of days. SO MY HAIR WAS A RATS NEST. Normally I would detangle it before getting in shower, but this time I did not. I figured.. well, lets see what this shampoo & conditioner can do.So after towel drying. I grabbed my wide tooth comb and detangler spray I expected a chore ahead of me.. to spend the next 10 minutes or so working through all the snarls and knots. Before I sprayed, I took my comb to my hair just to see what nightmare was ahead of me. MY COMB SLID THROUGH MY HAIR. You have no idea how tangled my hair had been. I was so not looking forward to detangling it. YET I didnt have to after using this shampoo and conditioner. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY??Now because of that, I really expected my hair to dry limp. I just assumed it was over conditioned. BUT, my hair dried looking clean and full of body. Curiously, it is still on the dry and slightly frizzy side. Not weighed down at all.So I would say this is more for normal hair, maybe more for hair that leans oily. I think way too light for dry course hair, especially wavy/curly types. It does an absolutely phenomenal job on detangling it (for reals will use this forever more if this is something I can count on). I may consider one of their shampoo and conditioner that is geared for more dry hair.Aroma: 5 starsCleaning: 4-5 starsConditioning: 3 starsGoing with 4 stars as it really isnt for ""all hair types"", my dry hair is still leaning dry, yet at least looks and feels clean. The unexpected benefit of being a supreme detangler really got me wanting to try something else withing this brand, which I think is worth mentioning."
115,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Way better than the Coconut Quench,"My wife wrote this review:This isn't my first time trying their shampoo and conditioner. My first try was with their Coconut Quench. I struggled to get anything out of the bottle, particularly the conditioner. It made my hair too weighed down and I didn't like that my hair seemed to feel more dry and brittle.This Hibiscus Water pair is much better. While it still doesn't come out of the bottles as easy as brands that use different packaging, this was much easier to get out than the Coconut. I wish they would use a pump if they're set on the shape of the bottles or change the bottle so it's easier for the consumer to use.The scent is incredible! Very fruity and reminds me of summertime.Their products, being sulfate-free, have trouble lathering unless you wash twice. Use a small amount first, and rub between palms to work up a lather, then work through hair, rinse, and repeat. The second wash will create a lot of lather!My hair felt clean and wasn't weighed down with this. I let my hair air-dry and my curls didn't have much frizz, bitt it certainly didn't remove it all, and it doesn't claim to tackle frizz, I don't think.My hair did seem more hydrated because my curls were more defined than when I use some other brands. I am chalking that up to the aloe vera being the first ingredient in this.I am removing 1.5 stars due to the bottles. So a 3.5. I won't be buying this in the future because of that. While this is easier to get out than their other one, I wonder if maybe I just got lucky this time or maybe after I use product it will become more difficult to dispense and I cannot stand fighting with product to get out. So I've star for bottles and two stars for price BECAUSE of the bottle and difficulty getting product out. They're cute, but it's a pain. (Please, include a pump)!If they were to do something about the bottles (shape or add a pump to this) then I can see myself purchasing this in the future.I love that it's made in the USA ( with US and imported ingredients), and that it's cruelty-free."
116,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I enjoy hair care products and have long and thick hair that goes to the middle of my back.  I am able to wear it naturally wavy/curly or straight depending on how it dries.  It is healthy and I look for shampoo and conditioner products that help with malleability, strength, shine, and that replenish my hair.  I enjoy scented shampoo and conditioners but notice that there is an extreme amount of floral perfume/fragrance in both.  Artificial perfumes and fragrances can be skin irritants and can also be drying.  This is especially true with sensitive skin.  My hair was difficult to work with after my first use.  I have continued to use it and my hair has become harder to tame.  It knots easier and I feel that it coats my hair causing it to become oilier faster.  There is a fair amount of fragrance left in my hair on my scalp which I am not sure is replenishing. The heavy fragrance seems to weigh down my hair.Suggestions for improvement-less fragrance-silkening ingredients that prevent tangling"
117,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't wash my hair but once or twice a week if that, depending on my level of activity. When I do a hard workout and have super greasy hair, I want to use a shampoo that will help bring my hair back to life. The hibiscus shampoo and conditioner is really great. The smell, the quality, the price. This is everything I would expect for a shampoo and conditioner combo at $16 (at the time of review). The shampoo sudds really well. You can ensure all of your hair is covered and moisturized. I definitely feel well hydrated after using this since my hair has volume and not dry or greasy. The conditioner is just as good too. It doesn't strip your hair either. The bottles aren't huge, but you get a lot for the little shampoo it requires to wash long, thick hair. Plus, the bottles ar actually pretty and not boring. Not that I look at that, but it is nice. The one issue I have is the very first squeeze takes a while for shampoo to come out. After that, it works great."
118,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration shampoo and conditioner were available to me through the Amazon Vine program.  I like them.  They are hydrating, with the first ingredient being aloe (followed by water).  They are vegan and free from silicones, parabens, SLS and sulfated surfactants.  The shampoo smells wonderfully fruity and lathers up nicely.  The conditioner leaves hair feeling soft and manageable and easy to comb through.  (Note that it is recommended to keep on 3-5 minutes, which is longer than most other conditioners.)  At the time of this review, this shampoo and conditioner set is about 2.5 times the price of the shampoo alone, which shouldn’t be the case.  This shampoo and conditioner are made in the USA, and Maui is owned by Johnson & Johnson."
119,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recently got balayage and highlights on the ends of my 3N hair. It was extremely stressed and every shampoo I was using was so drying and I couldn’t get my fingers through the ends while in the shower. Ever since I switched to this I’ve been able to run my fingers through my ends while shampooing. The conditioner adds so much moisture to the strands. My hair is soft and it looks less frizzy without any product in it when I let it dry naturally wavy.I really enjoy the scent because it’s winter and I’m craving spring and summer smells and it’s just got that tropical watermelon fruitiness to it. It’s not like a little kid shampoo though. It’s got a hint of floral to it that makes there scent a bit more complex than a kids shampoo.
120,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I don't really like the smell of this one. I have used the coconut milk one from this brand and I loved that smell. But this one is a bit bitter and reminds me of when I was young and older ladies perfume. Not my favorite smell.The shampoo has a weird texture, kind of reminds me of egg whites. It was really weird, but when I got it in my hair it did lather well and rinse out well. The conditioner was better, it goes in the hair smoothly. It asks you to leave it in your hair for 3 to 5 minutes which I did. My hair felt smooth and soft at the end. It was easy to brush. And feels soft and lightweight when it is dry. Overall it is okay."
121,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"product review: Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Shampoo + Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 Fl OzThis Maui moisture lightweight hydration hibiscus shampoo got nice smell and stays in hair through out the day. The scent is pleasant. The challenge was with the conditioner that is super thick and requires an effort to get it out, currently it is okay with the weight of conditioner I could get it out. I am interested to see how I will get it out when there is not much conditioner in the bottle. As the name suggests, it is lightweight hydration and also sulfate free, so it is not ideal for very oily or greasy hair."
122,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a herbal essences / Pantene pro v user forever. I have noticed my hair must of gotten used to those shampoos, so I wanted to change it up.  It's funny, on a trip to Hawaii I ran out of hair care products so purchased these there and loved it.  So I re purchased and now am an avid user. I notice my hair feels cleaner, i don't have to wash it as often to up keep the fresh look and it smells great.  It's got new life and I notice less hair coming out as I wash it. Maybe because I don't wash it as often or because theres less harsh chemicals. I say give it a go and you won't regret it"

124,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This is a really wonderful shampoo. It has pretty good ingredients and a nice botanical/sweet fragrance that's kind of like the Herbal Essence shampoo line, only not as heavy. For some reason, a lot of shampoos make my hair greasy, but this one did not do that. It has enough of a lather to it that you can make a shampoo mohawk in the shower (what? you don't do that?) but not so much that it clings to your hair or creates a kind of soap scum film. I really like this duo a lot and will be using them regularly."
125,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This shampoo + conditioner duo is quite lovely. Both are lightweight, easy to work into hair, easy to rinse from hair. Shampoo does a great job of gently cleansing. Leaves hair soft and hydrated when used alone. The conditioner hydrates, softens and smooths hair while leaving it soft and shiny. Each has an amazing scent that is not at all overpowering, gagging or terribly 'flowery'. Both can be used on all hair types, including color treated hair."
126,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This brand is amazing. I’ve used a different shampoo from them so when I saw the shampoo + conditioner combo, I knew I had to grab it. I enjoyed the scent and the conditioner had a lot of slip. Made my wash day easy and smooth.However, the conditioner was leaking out of the bottle. Plus, took about a month to get to me in Florida so that was also a downer."
127,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This is a nice shampoo and conditioner set. I honestly couldn't even notice a scent to it, although I had high hopes of tropical paradise. But no such luck.  It cleaned and conditioned my hair, but again, honestly, it didn't seem any better or any worse than any basic shampoo I've used. It's really pretty though and the bottles look great in the shower."
128,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This shampoo and conditioner combo arrived quickly and well packaged. They smell nice, but the texture (of shampoo in particular) is odd: it's more gel-like and ""gloopy"" - something that I did not expect. It doesn't lather very well. For hair products marketed as ""moisturizing"", these did not leave my hair feeling hydrated any more than basic shampoos."
129,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,This shampoo and conditioner duo has made my hair super soft and easy to take care of. I really like the smell of it as well! The ingredients seem to be really clean and lack the chemicals that are supposedly bad to use.

This the worst shampoo I have ever used. Every time I would take a shower a huge amount of hair would fall out and I thought it was stress but then I stopped using just the shampoo to see if it was the problem. Once I stopped using it, my hair stopped coming out and got much healthier. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"

It’s so so so bad and I don’t usually breakout bad like this I just have occasional acne but this is SO BAD and they’re white heads and I can tell by the acne something is irritating and breaking me out and I think it’s this shampoo

My hair has started to loose it’s curly pattern and is crunchy. I only use the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in. I’m only 18 and I’m blessed my hair grows quickly.

The second time I had noticed a slight tingling on my scalp and then clumps of hair fell out. I have never experienced this with any shampoo before. I immediately discontinued using it. A few Google searches and I found out this has happened to many people. User beware!

144,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,No regrets. Best shampoo ever.,This is the best shampoo that I’ve ever had. My personal hair isn’t oily or dry. The smell is AWESOME. It’s very easy to smooth your hair out with it. I had no problem with the packaging at all. I would definitely recommend getting this.
145,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy this,I have two words: NEVER AGAIN. This stuf left my scalp dry and I have lots of dandruff
146,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Made my hair fall out!,Made my hair fall out! I read the reviews on Ulta’s website saying the same thing but didn’t want to believe it. I should have listened. This made my hair fall out within 3 washes and that’s the only thing I changed. Don’t buy! It’s too much of a hassle to return so I’m just using it as hand soap.
147,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor packaging,Smells great but it spilled in the package and I lost about 30% of the shampoo.

153,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this shampoo and conditioner and I love this brand. I had used the blue bottles from this brand and loved it so I wanted to try these out too, I figured they would be just as good or better then the other set and I was right. This shampoo is infused with hibiscus water, passion fruit and watermelon, it made my hair feel so soft and clean. After using this set my hair seem to have alot more bounce to it then usual, which I loved. It didn’t weigh my hair down like alot of others do. It was so soft and easy to manage without any frizz, my hair is usually frizzy after I blow dry it but after using these it was so much easier to straighten and fix. It really made a difference in my hair. I also love how great it smells and that I can smell it in my hair all day. This is a really great set and really helps to condition your hair and leaves it soft and clean. My hair has never felt so clean!! Would definitely recommend!!"
154,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of expensive in my opinion but I love the fragrance,I first bought Maui at a discount store the sea minerals. And I've bought several others but this is one of my favorites . My hair is so dry not much works to moisturize it I just love the scent.
155,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest Review,Love the scent and how my hair feels after.
156,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great smell, maybe not for me though.","𝗦𝗖𝗘𝗡𝗧: I'm all for fruit/floral scented shampoos, but I've got to say this for my lads, this is exceptionally fruity and floral. It's a very pleasant smell though. If those scent profiles are your preference, this will be for you.𝗦𝗖𝗔𝗟𝗣: I'd say I'm more on the oily side, and the day after using this (and maybe even almost immediately out of the shower), my scalp was feeling a little irritated. I'm not sure if it dried me out per se but come the following day, my scalp was itchy and oily feeling.I'd say this is for people with non-sensitive scalps and (this is a blanket statement but) people who like more feminine scents. Not bad, just not for me!"
157,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve always wanted to try Maui moisture hair products so I was so excited to wash my hair with this shampoo and conditioner combo. I love the bright pink bottle! The smell of these soaps are amazing and leave my hair smelling fresh for a while. I was pleasantly surprised to feel how soft and hydrated my hair was after using these products for the first time. I like that there’s no sulfates either! I’m excited to try other variations of this product and would recommend it for the price.
158,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,So much wax!,"It leaves hair very, very waxy! Smells great tho! I thought my daughter just wasn’t fully rinsing but the shampoo just leaves a waxy film on her hair. I tried it on my hair too and it did the same. So we gave it to a friend because they loved the smell and the same happened to them. Sad because it’s so heavenly smelling"
159,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,very awsome,I think that it was a very good deal because it does not ruin mz daughters hair it just keeps it all natural.
160,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Open bottle,This bottle of shampoo was delivered open and missing 1/4 of the bottle. It also got all over the other items in the box
161,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These products leave my hair clean, nicely scented but not overly scented, and soft feeling. Those are the basic things I expect from shampoo and conditioner and this set delivers those things. I have zero issues with these products. My hair is not dry so in terms of hydration, I really can't say that I think my hair is more moisturized because it wasn't in bad condition to start. I like these products and will buy them again in the future."
162,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"For its price and performance, it's a steal. Low price, does great with my half thin half thick wavy/curly hair."
0,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for low porosity hair!,"I was hesitant to buy this conditioner since Aloe was an ingredient. I have extremely protein sensitive hair and aloe typically doesn't react well with my low porosity strands.  I didn't notice how well it worked until after observing how moisturized my curls felt over the course of three days! I used it again before straightening my hair and my hair felt incredible! In my opinion, this conditioner is better than the Shea Moisture's Low Porosity line that was discontinued. I haven't tried Maui's shampoo from this line yet but I hope it works great also."
1,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Changed My Life!,"I have both the shampoo and conditioner. This line is literally the only thing I have ever tried that can actually make my hair go from limp waves to healthy looking curls! I love how light it is, perfect for my thin, low porosity hair. It smells really nice too!"
2,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Curls,This conditioner has great slip for detangling hair in the shower. Perfect for curly girls since it is silicone free!! Smells nice and works well with aloe as the first ingredient
3,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,I currently don’t use this brand’s products anymore.,"I used to love this brand until I found out that there was DMDM hydantoin in some (if not all) of their products. the chemical DMDM hydantoin is a formaldehyde donor / released preservative, an allergen/irritant, (and possibly carcinogenic — as formaldehyde is potentially carcinogenic and also an irritant), which can cause hair damage/loss and/or scalp/skin problems, etc. I currently don’t use this brand’s products anymore as I avoid using products with the chemical DMDM hydantoin. — Amy Rose, Main Character (@VeganAmyRose)."
4,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product!,Very awesome product ! I absolutely love these products from this company and the packaging is everything ! Must buy!💞
5,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Give it a try,"Smell is really beautiful but I'd not say the same for detangling and smoothness performance. I definitely have used better ones for cheaper. Wouldn't buy again, but still five stars for the smell.."
6,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,BLESS THIS MAGIC,"There was a little product seeping out from under the lid, but not discernable cracks or damage to the bottle.This stuff smells LOVELY and GORGEOUS and it was worth waiting by the mailbox for. My hair was so limp and clogged from the wrong hair products (I have low porosity wavy and was using heavy products),  but I used this in the shower with a gentle clearing Aveeno shampoo, plopped it, then put it in a silk beanie when I went to bed,  and I woke up a GODDESS again. My hair was soft, bouncy, curly/wavy, detangled goodness. My husband was all about it. I also didn't have to use gallons on my hair, so this product should last me a minute. It's now day 3 hair and there is still curl clumping 👏 and minimal frizz 👏 and it still smells good. Can't imagine what this is like paired with the shampoo."
7,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great but that’s it,"***UPDATE***I’ve been using this for a while now trying to give it some time, being I’ve heard such good things about this shampoo and conditioner....but this has done nothing except made my dry scalp worse.I have dry spots all over my scalp, it’s horrible. And it makes my scalp SO ITCHY. The only good thing about this is the scent. I do not recommend for sensitive scalps :(:(I bought the shampoo and conditioner in hopes of replacing my head and shoulders with something a little better ingredients wise. My hair and scalp gets so dry especially in the wintertime. It smells great but I have a few complaints. First, the conditioner is incredibly hard to get out of the bottle, I don’t know if it’s the bottle or the thickness but it’s pretty annoying. Secondly, my scalp gets pretty itchy still and I still have a few dry spots. I will continue to use for a few weeks and update if it gets better. I only just started using it so I will give it time."
8,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, just not from Amazon I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️","Okay so, I'm not usually a harsh rater when it comes to this kind of thing.Let me start off by saying, its definitely not like what you would get at the store. Its a completely different texture. Secondly, I had the shampoo and conditioner for a little over a month before tossing it out because the smell in the bottle COMPLETELY  disepated and it just smells like gross chemicals.I love this line, just not from Amazon."
9,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Low porosity hair,"This has been the best for my head full of curvy, fine, low porosity hair. I tend to have very oily scalp/roots & dry ends, but this has made my hair more balanced, root to tip. Very lightweight & makes my curls & waves less frizzy & so soft. The scent is light, which I prefer. It is difficult to get through my hair though. Not much slip, but I don't know if that would change its effectiveness for low porosity. I will continue to buy & recommend for anyone with similar hair."
10,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,If you like baby powder you will like this..,"I’m a very scent oriented person..I feel like the smell of the soap, shampoo and conditioner are the best part of the shower experience. And this conditioner is sadly a big letdown. It smells like slightly sweet baby powder. I don’t like baby powder, so this is really gross to me. It takes my shower time from “ooh ahh” to “ew ugh”. Thankfully the scent rinses out and doesn’t linger in my hair.Also the packaging needs a rethink, I find it very difficult to squeeze out the product."
11,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't torture your locks!,"This stuff immediately made my hair feel like straw & tangled the second I applied it! Stripped all the natural oils out & I had to clean my drain of the copious amount of hair that fell out. I don't color or heat style my hair, so that wasn't the issue. This shampoo was super thick & sticky with ZERO scent."
12,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,She be doing her job 💅🏼,Im here from the other Maui bamboo shampoo so lemme restate everything. I’m 16 and I was looking a lot of hair (not from stress babe) and I was looking for new products that would be better for my hair. I have type 2a hair and I have greasy hair. I do 2 washes with this shampoo and my hair felt so clean. I used the Hibiscus Water conditioner instead of the same  collection because I heard it was a little drying. This combination works so well. The smell is also very fresh. The Hibiscus waters scent smells sweet like a watermelon. Ik i saw some tik toks that said it might have a ingredient that’s bad for you which is the Diazolidinyl Urea but I was willing to try this. The pink Hibiscus Waters conditioner does not have this!  It’s awesome and I also use a Wet hair brush from the company Wet. They cause less breakage since the bristles are more flexible. For a leave in conditioner I use the Keratin Hask Spray and I do not spray my scalp with this because it’s not supposed to be used like that. This has been helping my hair (as it should purrr) and I hope it helps y’all too.
13,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't Do Anything For Me,"I have fine hair that has plenty of moisture but tangles easily. So, I got this for after shampooing...and even though it's somewhat lightweight, it doesn't really help with detangling at all for me. I don't know how to explain it, but it almost feels kind of acidic on my hair. Like, it just grabs my hair and makes it sticky but doesn't sink in. I don't know, I've just never used a conditioner that feels like this. And I've tried a TON of conditioners. I guess it just feels odd and doesn't really do much, even with it being lightweight. I have had other lightweight conditioners in the past that at the very least detangle my hair. But hair products are so specific to every individual, so I can't definitively say it sucks for everyone. I bought, so I'll use it up, but I personally won't buy it again."
14,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,So nice!,"I have thin, damaged hair that is bleached and long in length. This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel, look, and smell so nice! The shampoo cleanses well but doesn’t feel stripping since it doesn’t have sulfates in it, and the conditioner is moisturizing yet lightweight on my thin hair! It smells light and fresh all day long. I’d definitely recommend these!"
15,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"After taking way too long to do a porosity test I found out I was low porosity and bought this conditioner immediately after. I use a lot of conditioner but this bottle holds a surprising amount and the consistency is not too thin or too thick. After a few uses my hair no longer immediately pours out water, it’s incredibly soft, and my curls look great for more than one day. Highly recommend if you’re a struggling with low porosity"
16,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves a pleasant scent and feel to your hair.,"Probably one of the best fragrances they offer. I work hard and my hair takes a beating from the sun and constant interactions w my environment of jet fumes and debris. I enjoy the shampoo and conditioner and feeling clean after use. Ya, it's a little on the feminine side but I honestly don't mind w this. It smells and feels pretty damn good..."
17,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lightweight but nourishing,Second time I’ve bought this conditioner. Great because there’s no coconut oil to weigh my hair down. Love the smell. Hate the packaging though. Square bottle makes it hard to get out.
18,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Isopropyl Alcohol?,"When I first used it, the first thing I noticed was the smell. It smells like straight up rubbing alcohol. I looked at the ingredients and Isopropyl Alcohol was one of them. The texture is weird, it’s thin and almost gritty? It didn’t feel too moisturizing in the shower, HOWEVER.. I was able to brush my hair wet much more easily than other conditioners I’ve used. I don’t know if I got a bad batch but seeing Isopropyl Alcohol as an ingredient definitely caught me off guard."
19,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,To drying for my fine hair,Love this whole brand but this one with the least hydration was too drying for my fine thin hair
20,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair Fell Out,My hair was coming out in bunches after using this! I stopped using it right away. I've never had that issue with Shampoo or Conditioner before. It seemed to be both the Shampoo and the Conditioner. Maybe it's just my hair...
21,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sickly, overly-sweet smell.",I can’t give an accurate review because I couldn’t get past the scent which was overwhelming. I donated both the shampoo and conditioner.
22,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,you’ll smell amazing,my favorite shampoo and conditioner by far. they make your hair smell so amazing. i always get compliments about smelling good. definitely try this shampoo or one of the other maui moisture scents. they’re all amazing (this one’s my favorite though).
23,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Please redesign the bottles!,"Firstly I like the smell. It’s light and pretty. I was drawn to the pink bottle and I’m always looking for sulfate and paraben free shampoo/conditioner. What I disliked was that it was so difficult to squeeze out of the bottle. The shampoo was fine, but the conditioner has the viscosity of rubber cement so you put that in a hard square bottle and even when it’s full I had to bang on it upside down to get out. It’s a petty problem but irritating enough that I would not buy it again."
24,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Freakin fabulous conditioner.,"This is great stuff. A bit pricey but it’s so nice. Smells great, really thick and moisturizing. If Bath and Body Works made a conditioner, this would be it."
25,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It might be good but it won't come out of the bottle.,"I like all the Maui products I've tried and feel sure I would like this one too, but it's so thick I literally cannot get it out of the bottle. . I tapped on the bottom, I hit it against the shower wall, but nothing came out. I want a shower not a workout. Finally pitched it in the trash."
26,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just looks pretty,"Nothing really special about this... it’s one of those hyped up products for no reason. Doesn’t make my hair any less oily, gets oily a day later like usual. Makes my hair a bit frizzy too. Going back to my free & clear... more costly but way better."
27,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Buildup on scalp,"The shampoo and conditioner gave me build up and an itchy scalp. My curls kind of fell flat which was odd since I have naturally curly hair.The smell is nice but it was not worth it.The parent company tests on animals, that's a hard pass...goodbye!"
28,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for Oily Hair Types,"Unfortunately this product made my hair greasier. It made me look like I hadn’t showered. It’s advertised as for all hair types but this did not work for me. I would recommend to those with dry hair. My hair leans towards being oily. I liked the smell, and this seems like a nice cruelty free company. I’m sad this didn’t work for me."

113,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Made our hair fall out. No, seriously.","We have been using Maui Moisture (various formulas) for a couple years now, and at first we loved it. I started noticing my hair falling out by the handfuls every time I washed it, and didn't connect it to these products until my husband also started looking like an 80 year old man with thinning hair. He thought he was losing his hair early, I thought I was stressed. We both lost about 3/4 of our original thickness, so recently switched to another brand (Raw Sugar). Immediately the hair loss stopped and our hair feels much better now, although very damaged from years of Maui Moisture. Hair loss, dryness, split ends, dull color, no body, and hair weighed down and coated in disgusting propylene glycol. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS."
114,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not use on curly hair..ever!,"I purchased this product along with the shampoo, and my hair is now fried. I have naturally curly hair, so my shower is filled with different products to try and get some moisture in my dry curly hair. This is the opposite of moisture..it’s like if I lived in the driest climate imaginable and then poured chemicals on my hair to make sure it fried it. I’m sure it’s great for those who have oily hair and scalp, but for those with dry hair, this will kill it, period. Buyer beware. Pretty bottles, terrible product for normal to dry hair."
115,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,SOFT AND SHINY HAIR!,"I love Love “LOVE” this shampoo and conditioner. I have been trying all types of pharmacy products. Until one day I came across this name brand. I found the packing attractive and the scent pleasing. So I said what the heck! I Was pleasantly surprised with the results. It left my hair soft, less frizz, and brought out my natural shine! I strongly recommend this product!"
116,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight but moisturizing, clarifying, perfect for 2C/3A low porosity hair!!!","I have low porosity 2C/3A hair. When Shea Moisture’s Low Porosity shampoo was discontinued, I was DEVASTATED.Everywhere I searched for a similar product would recommend this shampoo. Being that it was an unfamiliar brand (and very affordable), I was hesitant to try it.I ordered it with the best hopes and no matter how many times a week I wash, my hair is perfectly moisturizer and lightweight!! I’m so excited and happy about this product. It’s been over a month now and it hasn’t lost its charm."
117,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,My 3b/3c hair was shedding because of this product.,"Dont use. I have curly 3b/3c hair and I've been using this product for a while. I always notice that I get alot of shedding and I thought that it was because of stress because I study and work. But as soon as I decided to swap both of my maui moisture shampoo and conditioner for shea moisture jamaican black castor oil brand, there was no more shedding. Before my hair was accumulating by a handful per wash, and idk why it took me so long to find out that it was these products but I'm glad I did. My hair is very thin and I am contemplating getting a hair cut but I will try to revive and regrow it first before big chopping. Please learn from my experience"
118,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super lightweight and moisturizing for hair that gets easy buildup,"I switched to the Maui Moisture hibiscus water line from co-washing because I was experiencing scalp problems, frizz, and terrible buildup. This stuff is great! The shampoo cleans well without drying and is moisturizing, and the conditioner moisturized without weighing down. It is perfect for fine, low porosity hair. My buildup issues are gone and my frizz is SO much better."
119,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Repaired Hair,My hair improved a lot if went from thin to dry hair to shiny hair volume hair within a few weeks of. Mixed it between using the shampoo and conditioner from Maui Moisture. No Sulfates a plus! Love the pink bottle packing. Some improvements wish the smell lasted a bit longer/the bottle is kind of hard to use-squeeze. Came unprotected so some of the conditioner spilled. I used it in combo with a shampoo brush; give it try! Little goes a long way.

123,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Isn’t the same as the ones bought in the store,"I tried to buy the conditioner at target the same time I bought the shampoo but they were sold out so I ordered it here. I was surprised the scent was so light since the shampoo scent is stronger. I went to target the next week and smelled the conditioner once it was back in stock and it smells exactly like the store bought shampoo bottle. Don’t buy this, it’s not the same product as the ones in stores or it’s expired/old. I recommend ordering on target website or do order pickup to ensure that you’re getting the real products."
124,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff is fabulous,This whole brand of product is the One of the best purchases I’ve ever made. My hair has a tendency to be dry tangles easily when wet does shampoo and conditioner combined make my hair so soft. The tangles just flowed out. The smell is sensational. I will recommend this to others and I hope that you will give this a try it’s well worth the money. A little goes a long way
125,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Contents Spilled Out,The scent is absolutely wonderful.

131,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Way better than dish soap,"Years ago I abandoned store bought shampoo and began using dish soap to wash my very dry hair.  I""m not even sure why I did that, but probably because I'm very frugal. Recently I decided I wanted softer hair, so I went on Amazon and found this Maui product. It was simple, inexpensive and worth a try. To my surprise I""m very pleased with it. It makes my hair very soft and doesn't take out the natural curl in my hair. I""m really very pleased and will buy another because I live in two places and have two of everything! I'm very glad I started using this and recommend it."

142,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,May be a bit more but worth it,"Its hard for me to find a set of shampoo n conditioners that don't dry out or weigh down with greases. I have middle length brightly colored hair so I finally found this brand on accident actually and fell hard. They have great strong scent, and just a suggestion start small a little goes long way. I was mad when realizing that. I was wasting it. Mid back length I can use between a dime and quarter size and works great"

144,"Maui Moisture Lightweight Hydration + Hibiscus Water Conditioner for Daily Moisture, No Sulfates, 13 fl oz",Style: Conditioner,Verified Purchase,"Hice un pedido de varias cosas y el acondicionador se derramó un poco y ensució lo demás. Se debería tener mucho más cuidado al empacar los pedidos para que estas reseñas no perjudiquen al producto que es bastante bueno. Fuera de eso me encantó, en general esta marca me gusta mucho pero este acondicionador es especialmente bueno para mi cabello grueso, con cualquier otro acondicionador se esponja demasiado mi cabello y queda muy seco y con este acondicionador mi cabello no queda esponjado ni pesado y previene muy bien el frizz además huele delicioso."

If I walked around with my hair down there would be a trail of hair left behind. I would lose so much hair in the shower like I had to move the hair away from the drain (I know, EW!) I don’t even know how I still have enough hair left to cover my head with all the shedding!! BUT THIS SHAMPOO. It is more expensive than the sulfate free ogx one I’ve been using, but idk if it’s the aloe vera in this or what but I lose so little hair now. Like five strands fall out in the shower. It’s so crazy!! Thank you Maui!"

I have typical, straight, thick Asian hair, but recently my hair has gotten a little wavy and rough, dry, and tangles easily, which I've never had a problem with before. I've tried a couple of shampoo/conditioner pairs since and this brand is by far the worst of all.I used it for a few consecutive washes just to make sure (I wash every other day), and this shampoo and conditioner somehow both weighed my hair down (it felt heavy?) but also dried out and tangled my hair worse than any other product in my life. My hair felt SO rough to the touch and I actually had a giant tangle the size of a ping pong ball that HURT to try to untangle, which has never happened before. I basically basted my hair in a different conditioner that was okay but I didn't love to gently untangle the mess this brand made. I'm fairly certain this brand made my back and skin break out as well. Very disappointed, maybe my hair is  not a good match for it? :("

Don’t buy :(,This product gave me a really extra clean look so clean as if it were bleached that gave me lots of frizz as you can see in my picture. Not to mention the fall out of my hair….. I was loosing chunks and lumps of hair at each wash. I don’t recommend this at all :(

We have well water and a water softener.  I have very thick hair.  The length is about 6 inches past my shoulders. I was having problems with such horrible knots,  I was ready to get it all cut off.  I read this shampoo and conditioner would help moisturize.  I really like it.  It has helped.  At first I was using the shampoo and conditioner and then adding an additional name-brand leave in conditioner.  But now. I'm able to use this shampoo and conditioner only without an additional leave in conditioner. It is a great value for the price and or smells nice too!!"
5,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do Not Use on Thick Oily Hair,"I have oily roots but the rest of my hair is dry. I've used ""hydrating"" and ""moisturizing"" shampoos before but wanted to try something new. I gave the moisturizing quality 5 stars because I couldn't go more than a day without washing it, so it definitely moisturizes if that's what your looking for - but not for me. Normally I can go about 3 days with the help with baby powder and dry shampoo but not with this. It made my hair feel very heavy and as my sister described it, ""it feels like someone put lotion in your hair."" Maybe it's better for people with thin and very dry hair. I used it about 6 times and had to give it away."
6,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy,"I have been using this product in my partner hair and it has been doing a great job. It moisturizing the hair while cleaning it. The scent is lovely. For the price it is worth buying. You dont have to use a huge amount and it going through the hair easily. The shampoo and conditioner washes out without leaving any residue just enough moisture for the hair and does the cleaning job perfect. The hair mask i have been using for my 4c hair before braiding and it gives my hair a different texture, more manageable as my partner hair is more of a curly texture. So though our hair texture is different it treats them both the same. Compliments them, moisturize them and keep them hydrated"

It is thicker than most shampoos that i’ve tried.I am in my late 60’s and my hair tends to be very dry and coarse looking, or so I thought until I tried this shampoo. I thought I would give it a try after googling the top 10 shampoo and conditioners. This one was on the list without paying an arm and a leg for it!I am still waiting for the conditioner to arrive so I used a Pantene conditioner for the time being.My hair is back to shiny, soft, smooth looking hair!! YES!!"

The second I opened the box I was hit with such a very strong beautiful aroma. My only issue is that my shampoo must have opened during delivery because the bottle has no damage, but the lid was closed when I opened the box so it might have just leaked out of the bottle? I was super excited to try Maui products but opening my package to find a good bit of product had gone to waste was extremely underwhelming. I’m also confused on why only one bottle was wrapped, the bottle that was wrapped didn’t leak at all. I had seen a few other reviews saying the same thing about wasted product or even about damaged bottles so little helpful advice for future orders to save your customers and your company from wasting any more time and money, maybe you guys should wrap every product so that product doesn’t spill out or so the bottles don’t get damaged (:"

It does what it’s meant to do, I’ve just  gotta get used to my shampoo not sudsing up. Difficult to lather. Also doesn’t have a great smell - it’s not bad, just not great, either. After using with the conditioner my hair feels good and I know I’m not damaging my hair, which is really all that matters. Right?"
10,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,The smell is amazing,"This shampoo is very moisture rich.  For me, this isn’t the best for a shampoo because it makes my scalp oily pretty quickly.  I will still use it because it smells so good!  I like the conditioner better because it has the same smell.  The conditioner is thick and it feels like it penetrates the hair better than lighter conditioners.  I prefer the conditioner over the shampoo and I think the price is good for the quality of then product.  I prefer this scent and product the most from this brand.  However, I really do not like the deep conditioning masque in this same scent.  It is terrible and makes my hair feel like I put something extremely cheap on my hair."

I'm a white lady growing my fine hair out long, and I'm 40yo, so there's new gray and a different texture than before. I thought I'd need to really strip my hair to get body and movement, but I actually need more moisturising and repair than I thought. Paired with the conditioner, this is the only stuff that really makes me want to keep growing it out. Highly recommend!!"

Boy is it nice. I would venture to say it is the best shampoo I’ve ever used. The scent is not flowery, which is important to me because I don’t want to smell  like a flower. It smells really nice and tropical. It’s hard to describe the scent; not really coconut, maybe more like macadamia. But the real beauty is the lather. This just feels so rich and smooth. And it leaves my hair soft and silky. I don’t even use conditioner with it because the shampoo does such a good job."

My hair could not handle this product. It was too moisturizing. It made my hair greasy and I couldn't get the product (no matter how little I used) to rinse out fully. I normally wash my hair about 2x/week, and this made my hair greasy after 1 day. I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Maui Hibiscus one that I love, and can’t finish this set. Again, I think I’d you have hair that needs there moisturizing, this product would be fantastic though and it does smell great."

I haven’t notice a difference in the softness of my hair but it it isn’t drying. I have thick hair and I need to use a lot of it. My main gripe is that the shape of the bottles make it hard to hold when you’re in the shower and the product does not squeeze out quickly.  This review applies to the conditioner as well.
16,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Has coconut water that dried out my hair.,This product smells great and really defined my 4a-4b curls but my hair felt slightly dry afterwards and I think it is because of the coconut water. Anything coconut makes my hair feel drying. It does work for a lot of people and mayne ill give it another try. If your hair is sensitive to coconut products you probably shouldn't try this. Just check YouTube videos for someone who may have your hair porosity and texture prior to purchase.

The product Smells Fabulous!!! But there was a little problem there... as you can see the shampoo and the conditioner came in bad conditions I took them out the bag to wash them right away because the bottles opened.. and they arrive like this all messy and stuff so I took them out the bags they come in and wash the bottles and I came up to this!!! As you can see the shampoo is more empty than the conditioner is not a big deal but I mean if they were more Precocious with there products I would off given a 5 star I mean the Products smell super Good!!!

37,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"So first off I think a lot of people giving this product bad reviews is because they are uneducated about sulfate free shampoo. You can't just go from using normal shampoo like Pantene or shampoo that has sulfate in it to these organic sulfate free shampoos. There is a transition period your hair needs to go through first. When first switching your hair may feel oily and like straw it may look terrible and even fall out. That's because in the normal shampoos you are using, the chemicals coat your hair making it appear healthy and shiny. In reality underneath the hair is damaged and being stripped of its natural oils. When you use a product like Maui for the first time there's no chemicals hiding the damage to your hair. So your hair looking so bad after using these products is because that's how your hair really is! Your hair may start falling out because now that your scalp is breathing for the first time it's trying to dump the dead damaged hair to make way for new hair to grow. When making a switch you need to give it a few weeks at least which is not easy because your hair may look like crap. I say may because it depends on what shampoos you were using previously. Other chemical products play a role as well. Organic shampoo does not have all the harsh chemicals in it so it's hard for it to wash chemicals out. So if your using hair gel and spray and whatever else on your hair that has the ingredient silicone in it then washing with a sulfate free shampoo your gona get build up in your hair. So if your new to these types of shampoos you really need to do some research first because they may be an amazing product but you hate it because you are not using it the right way. Most people after they get through the transition period say their hair ever looked so beautiful and they would never go back.That being said I bought this shampoo and conditioner from walmart which was way cheaper than on amazon. Most organic shampoos don't lather well but this one latheres great. It smells great and feels light on my hair. When It Drys my hair is super shiny and bouncy. I am really pleased with this especially for the price. The conditioner I needed to use kind of a lot for my hair cuz it is thick and the conditioner is very thin but I have that problem with most conditioners. I love this shampoo though and highly recommend"

227,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Literally Fried My Hair; Do Not Buy,"I've been looking for more organic hair products recently, and have been familiar with Maui products for some time. I love their curl smoothie, and use it daily after my showers. I co-wash, so having a good conditioner is vital to my routine. I needed to replace my conditioner so I thought, why not? Let's try their wash out conditioner.WORST MISTAKE EVER.To be clear, I do not have excessively dry or frizzy. My hair is typically smooth and brushes easy, so long as I only shampoo once a week.After using this product once, my hair was literally fried. It was dry, brittle, and tangled easily. I could not get a brush through. I had to buy detangler! DETANGLER! I haven't needed that since I was SIX. It took two weeks of intensive hair masks (every other day) before my hair has returned to a normal, healthy state. Not only did it destroy my hair, but it left a thick residue that was difficult to wash out. It took two hours of rising, detangling, brushing, repeat, until I literally gave up and left the house in a hat to buy hair masks. I cannot stress this enough- this conditioner is NOT Girls with Curls Approved. I've never been his disappointed in a hair care product."
228,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Yuck,I did not buy from here but…honestly i have NEVER used a conditioner as bad as this. I survived through the shea butter one. It smelled nice! The coconut one made my hair mat and I could pull big clumps of matted hair right out of my head. It was matted badly. I immediately changed to redkin and z day later.. no more MESS. I felt i had to share. I have black naturally curly hair. This was awful!! I use biologe oil shampoo and pricy redkin. For a reason!!
229,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT for dry hair!,"I paid $6.50 for each bottle in this line (I got shampoo, conditioner and the spray oil) hoping for the best but not expecting much. In full disclosure, I also bought Ultra-Swim shampoo to get a good clarifying cleanse before starting this since google searching told me that switching from sulfates to natural cleansers takes a bit of an adjustment that I wanted to avoid (and supposedly my city water has chlorine added so I figured it couldn't hurt to use this stuff.) I did have to shampoo with that Ultra-Swim about 3 times in a row before getting a good suds worked up, but then I got a great suds from this shampoo and realized to my amazement that I could actually run my fingers through my hair during this shampoo stage! Normally I shampoo up, rinse it out, then condition and run my fingers through it to get all the loose hair out--I simply can't run my fingers through UNTIL adding conditioner. Not with this! I was running my fingers through it and through it and through it, amazed at the feeling! The conditioner was just as ""luxurious""...there's no other word for it!I have since washed with just these 2 and I don't get the VAST amount of suds from that first wash, but that's not surprising...I probably would if I shampooed 3 times like I did that first time (but it's not necessary now.) I still get a lot of suds and that conditioned feeling, though. I MIGHT could go without the conditioner and use only the moisturizing shampoo, but my hair is super dry so I won't even try. I haven't had any adjustment period to this (again, could be because of the Ultra-Swim clarification?) What REALLY got me was that google-searching mentioned scratching your head and getting ""dead skin cells"" under your nails (which I totally did) but then they said it was actually the sulfates left over...and sure enough, I don't get that under my nails now! I love this stuff!!!! And I only wash my hair every 3 days, so it will last me a LONG time! I even brought some travel sizes to work to share with a couple of friends, and they're in love, too! But if you don't have dry hair, this is NOT the product for you!"

A little bit goes a long way, too, which is important to me because I have very thick hair. I won't be buying here because it's twice the price it is in the store. I got it at Walmart for like, 6 something."
231,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful products!,"This product is amazing! I picked it up at my local beauty supply. I’ve used this line before and it is just as fantastic as I remember. First off this collection is perfect for all hair types but mostly dry, damaged, coarse textured hair. My hair is naturally Indian hair and it works wonders considering my hair was previously bleached. I wanted to switch to a silicone free shampoo and conditioner because I’m trying to get my hair back to healthy and I don’t want wax on my hair weighing it down. So I threw out my previous shampoo because it had so many chemicals including wax.  Relatively inexpensive and works really well. Would definitely recommend!"

Very thick no curls.. I’m also a cosmetologist. I love with two other females one with curly normal hair, the other extremely thin and fine and curly. On my hair it was AWFUL.. the smell is amazing .. I give them that.. we have tried three separate ones, all the same company. On the curly regular hair It was average.. and on thin hair it worked well. The deep conditioner was terrible on my hair and very fine hair. Worked well on normal/curly hair. I don’t recommend as a stylist. (I don’t recommend most over the counter shampoos, but sometimes it’s necessary) for fine hair is not terrible. Didn’t like it. The body was however, we all liked that!"

I recently bleached my hair and while it wasn't fried or breaking off, it was definitely feel a little lifeless and this product helped my hair a lot. It feels soft and has body now. I also love that this company doesn't use harsh chemicals either."
235,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,This made my hair fall out.,This made my hair worse. I have 3C type hair and wanted something that would hydrate my curls for a little extra umph. Well this was not it.  I read reviews and got a pretty even split so I decided to try it out.The packaging is nice and it smells good. It lathers well and feels nice in my hair.  After I rinsed my hair it was obvious that my hair was different. So much that my husband look at me and asked why my curls were straight.This took the elasticity out of most of my curls and left my hair feeling dry. The curls I did have left we're super frizzy.The worst part was that my hair now sheds like CRAZY! This made my hair fall out.Try at your own risk.
236,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This seemed so great at first.  The smell was wonderful.  The lather was great.  My hair felt clean and shiny.Fast forward a month later.  My hair is dull and looks greasy all the time.  It's dried out and snarls constantly.  I hate what this does to your hair after a few washes.  For the record, I never change shampoos before I go through a whole bottle (and I had a small one) but it was so bad I threw out the shampoo and two bottles of conditioner.It got two stars for smell onlyFor comparison sake: my hair is long, very straight, and fine.  I've switched to Paul Mitchell's tea tree shampoo and noticed an improvement right away, but I think the damage done will take some time to repair."

I was looking for an affordable, accessible shampoo that is sulfate free. It has a unique smell. Not a bad one but I can understand why some people might not be into it. Has been working well for me even with my major dry scalp issues in the winter."

The mask teased out the curls in a way that high end products (eg Aveda) have not! My hair is not overly dry or curly so I cannot speak to this for those in need of something more intense. I thought the consistency was not hydrating enough in shower but happy the next day."
239,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"I actually found and purchased this at Target. I tried it today to try and make the switch from Pantene. I'll be making an exchange later because not only did it make my hair feel weird and not very clean but it also somehow made my hair fall out in clumps and it stripped my hair of its color (dyed 2 weeks ago with box color). Smells great. Packing looks good. But that's not exactly worth my hair falling out and losing my color. Also, it's not exactly a big bottle and I've got long hair so I'd go through the bottle in about a month or 2."
240,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Shampoo to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"SO GLAD I tried this on a whim. It is delicate, yet really cleans, and leaves my hair feeling lovely. Soft, smooth, manageable. I have a lot of fine hair, stick straight (unless I sleep with it wet.) Chemically treated. This is the best over-the-counter shampoo and conditioner I've found for my chemically treated hair. Love it. I used to use Pureology and recently considered the similarly expensive Living Proof shampoo/condition. Save your money."

Pros: Great smelling, felt moisturizing, as her curls felt soft after washing.  Cons:  Made her hair start falling out.  I thought nothing of it at first, assuming it was because her hair had been in braids most of the week and this was just normal comb out.  But the same thing happened the next two weeks and I realized it started when we bought this.  Washed her hair last week with her previous brand, and barely any hair fall.  It's a shame because otherwise this was nice, but didn't work for us."

What got me to try it out was that the first ingredient is 100%  Aloe Vera Juice and not water like all the others; however, water is the 2nd ingredient. During the first wash, I immediately noticed that it softened and relaxed my hair while lathering and detangled it right away. After the first use, my hair was very soft, relaxed and shiny! It makes a great duo with the matching conditioner. The product has a ""coolness"" to it, which I am sure is due to the Aloe Vera Juice. Also, with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals makes this a healthy choice for your hair! I highly recommend. Just wished it came in larger quantities! It has a nice subtle fragrance which doesn't hold strong in the hair, but that is the least of my concerns when it comes to hair care."

Save your money!!,I'm sad to say that this is not worth what the hype is all about. Why you ask? well the first impression you get when you smell the fragrance it smelled absolutely pretty but once you wash your hair with it and come out of the shower the fragrance does not stay on your hair like you would think. The next thing I noticed was the next day my hair was even more dryer after using this product the day before. The price was overrated so there for I wouldn't recommend it.

First ingredient is Aloe!,"I bought this shampoo originally at CVS and instantly feel the difference in my hair and scalp. What made me take a chance on this product is that the first ingredient is aloe and aloe is known to have healing and healthy effects on the skin surface. This product also does not have silicone, parabens, and sulfates!  This is helpful since I color my thick hair and my scalp tends to be on the dry side, however after using the shampoo only once my hair feels softer and my scalp isn't as dry anymore. I would go back to either CVS or local grocery store since the cost here on Amazon is double the store price."

0,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,UGHHh,"I had high hopes for this after seeing reviews of it on here and YouTube. I thought I had finally found a cheap natural hair product, but a girl was wrong...again. It did not help my hair at all. I could not detangle with it and it left my hair feeling brittle and lifeless. I have hair from type 2A to 4B and it did nothing for me. My cousins have 4B-4C hair and it only worked on one of them."
1,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just okay,"I've been making a point of buying only paraben free, sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for the past year. I wish I could say I've finally found a really hydrating conditioner with this one, but it just does a very average job for me. I still have to comb a TON of argon oil through my hair after showering for it to be soft and nice. I like other attributes of the conditioner, like the smell and such, but hydration is the whole point, and it's not doing it. Too bad! I'd previously been using Avalon Organics Nourishing Lavender. I find this to be about the same in effectiveness, just less costly.For reference, my hair is colored, but not too dry.Also - not related to effectiveness - but it's challenging that the shampoo and conditioner bottles look exactly the same. I find it funny that there's nothing visually distinguishable between them. Haven't mixed them up; just funny."
2,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Literally my favorite brand,"I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this brand is. Aloe as the first ingredient is the most amazing thing you can have in a skin or haircare product. Add to the fact they have coconut water in it too, and it's f over! And no silicone, sulfates, or parabens? Please! This could smell like toilet water and I'd buy it and mask it, but luckily all of their products truly smell like Maui; words don't do it justice, but it smells how having tropical sun kissed skin feels.Dramatics aside, you simply will not find a product (body wash, shampoo, or anything) better than they have for a better price. Not with the ingredient concentration and quality for sure. I look hella too like I'm obsessed- I actually have really bad (diagnosed) OCD.I literally never write reviews but I literally have like 5 of their products and am obsessed with getting more (I always have some waiting in my cart to get when I have extra money- right now I have 2) cause they're so good. I've been using really good products for awhile now and you can genuinely feel the quality and moisture in the consistency like this stuff is really good. Their body wash is exquisitely moisturizing and nourishing(and I got volcanic ash-the harshest one- and I mix it with a bha/aha wash that I v drying) and its the only body wash I've ever used where the smell actually lingers ON YOUR SKIN!!!I recommend this brand enthusiastically to all my friends and family, and I recommend it to anyone. Clearly get the right product for you, but this brand, and their base formula, is good for anyone and everyone."

It has so much life and movement - all the dryness and frizz are GONE. Literally can't believe the results for the price, it feels like my hair went through a $200 conditioning treatment I'm obsessed!!!!"
5,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful and doesn’t condition the hair at all,This is the worst waste of money. It is worse than putting soap in your hair. It is completely worthless and useless. This is the worst conditioner that I have ever used. It is not like conditioner at all. You may as well put soap in your hair. This so-called conditioner does not do anything to condition the hair. It leaves your hair dry and a mess. Your hair will be dryer and have knots after using this.
6,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing detangler for dry , coarse , ethnic hair.","This is an excellent moisturizer. You’ll notice, it softens and detangles at the same time with the added bonus of smelling just amazing. I have long , natural , ethnic , thick hair that tends to dry out due to intense workouts , resulting in a lot of sweating and this has worked really well (a game changer) . After normal product use, my hair feels silky; I can literally comb through my thick hair with only my hands because it detangles and softens very well. I would highly recommend sectioning your hair and applying this product according to the instructions. I saw an immediate difference in the natural texture of my hair and couldn’t be happier. Big bonus: not greasy and no residue.Tip:Use in shower after washing your hair. Put this product on liberally , in sections , leave on about 2 minutes to let it work it’s magic, rinse out and enjoy the benefits. My hair is the driest around my nap so I apply liberally in my nap and hairline .  This clears the kinks. This is a thick product so turn the bottle upside down before using; it’s not watery so you may have to shake the bottle to get the product out.I learned of this product reading multiple reviews online , saw that it was sold on amazon and picked up 2 bottles. This is a staple in my house."
7,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally found the perfect shampoo and conditioner,"I've been using this shampoo and conditioner for 3 months now, and I can finally say I've found what I've been looking for.My whole life, I've had super thick, coarse, kinky, dry hair that basically feels like you're brushing hay. That may be in part due to PCOS and some hormone imbalances caused by that, and I've tried all kinds of products over the years to make it feel even remotely moisturized. Everything either didn't improve the feel of my hair, cost WAY too much, or left my hair feeling greasy.Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate made my hair feel smooth and look shiny for the first time ever...while leaving it feeling light and fluffy. Yay no grease! I feel like I got a salon product at an actual reasonable price. Highly recommend."
8,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't hesitate,"I had been using Tresemme shampoo and cheap conditioner for a while now and it's done nothing but damage my hair and leave residue. This is the first all natural product I've used and I'm in love!!! I paired this with the matching shampoo and the vanilla bean hair mask. I shampooed and then conditioned allowing it to sit for 10 minutes then rinsed, when I got out of the shower I used the mask as a leave- in product using a small amount on my damp hair. I allowed my hair to dry naturally. I have not seen my natural waves in months!!!! After just one use my hair feels like it's coming back to life. This is my new go too!!!!"
9,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"I've gone back and forth with so many different products for my dry and damaged hair and none of them gave me the results that this brand did! I bought the conditioner as well and it has made a huge difference. My hair is still dry, but definitely not as bad as it was. My frizz is pretty much gone, and my natural waves and curls have become so much more pronounced. I used to straighten my hair all of the time because I didn't like how my waves/curls looked, and now I don't straighten my hair! You end up only needing so little of this stuff to help your hair, it's amazing. I love the coconut scent, and my hair always feels so healthy after a wash. I highly recommend buying the conditioner with it for the best results. Will absolutely continue buying this when it comes time for more."
10,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Heal and Hydrate line,I love the Heal and Hydrate shampoo and leave in conditioner! My hair is very long and fine in texture.  So many moisturizing products weigh my hair down but not these. They do a great job. When my hair was a lot shorter I really liked the heal and hydrate conditioner and mask but i find now that my hair is very long they don't quite add as much moisture as I need.  I use another brand's hair mask instead to condition after shampooing now. But the shampoo and leave in are holy grail status for me. Not a fan of any of the other Maui Moisture lines I have tried but the heal and hydrate are amazing.
11,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally got it RIGHT!,"My teen daughter is so picky about her hair products!!  She has ""mixed"" hair and it is very thick and curly.  She is very scent sensitive and very difficult to purchase anything for!  I took a chance and she is in LOVE with this.  The scent is light but pleasing.  Her curls are soft and shiny, very manageable!  She hates a stiff or a thick product and this is neither.  She was actually impressed I picked this out!  Definitely recommend!"
12,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe it's the formula,"I have bought and used Maui products before and had no problem with them doing what they say they do. My issue with this Maui product is that the smell is really strong almost like the product has been doused in alcohol and perfume strong. For a minute I thought maybe the seller did something to my product(product came unsealed) and that was the cause of the smell. I don't remember Maui smelling so loud. Overall, as I stated the product did do what it stated but the smell is strong."
13,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,This is not Maui Moisture!,BUYER BEWARE whatever is inside this bottle is not the correct product! I buy this at my grocery store as needed but due to the pandemic I decided to purchase on Amazon and save myself a trip. I know exactly what this scent should smell and feel like. The product inside the bottle smells and looks nothing like it should. I will never buy things like this from Amazon again. Too easily switched out for cheap knock-off products!
14,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected....,This is a great product but I was not fond of how it left my hair. I think it cleaned it too much and left my hair without moisture for me to feel its essence look I was expecting of this product. It is highly wonderfully scented with wonderful aromas it is to embrace and be mentally transported in sweet lands but for me does not do the job I was hoping for.
15,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,A thick conditioner that smells amazing,"This shampoo is very moisture rich. For me, this isn’t the best for a shampoo because it makes my scalp oily pretty quickly. I will still use it because it smells so good! I like the conditioner better because it has the same smell. The conditioner is thick and it feels like it penetrates the hair better than lighter conditioners. I prefer the conditioner over the shampoo and I think the price is good for the quality of then product. I prefer this scent and product the most from this brand. However, I really do not like the deep conditioning masque in this same scent. It is terrible and makes my hair feel like I put something extremely cheap on my hair"
16,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works amazing!,"I love this and use it every time I shower. It has a great scent and really moisturizes my hair. I have curly hair, so it tends to be pretty dry. Not many conditioners make my hair look and feel this great!! The only problem is that it is hard to get out of the container. I just leave it upside down and that seems to work!"
17,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair falling out!!,"I’m pretty positive this is making my hair shed, (falling out to the touch of anything. ) I have pretty thin hair and I just used this and bam my hair is shedding like NEVER before. Never. My husband too! And I’m pretty sure it’s making my face break out too from when my hair touches my face. I don’t think this is as great a product as it tries to come off as. Sadly."
18,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It dried out my hair even more than normal making it more brittle and frizzy,"Update:I tried using it at different amounts of product I used but the results were nearly the same with end result that my hair completely dried out and it took couple of weeks to restore my hair to natural state.I do not recommend this product.First impression:Smells good, it's nice and thick creamy."

21,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,HATED this,"I was very excited to use this, I have straight hair, not damaged, just wanted to use a good shampoo, I read a lot of opinions and reviews and it seemed this was the best shot, the first time I used it I didn't understand why my hair was drying so bad, really really dry, horrible. I decided to give it another shot and it was the same thing, my hair was horrible after, I also used the shampoo of the same brand. I'm never using them again. I went back to my regular drugstore Dove and my hair is perfect."
22,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle is difficult to squeeze,"I’m not too fond of the scent (personal preference) but it’s a nice formula that doesn’t dry/dehydrate. The bottle design leaves a lot to be desired. It’s impossible to squeeze so you have to shake the product out, like ketchup."

Good leave in spray option for non-greasy finish,"Made my curls so shiny! Not very soft or overly greasy but I like that. I do not pick up on a very strong scent, but I prefer that. Scented products clash with perfume. Good price for a leave in spray conditioner- will buy again."
24,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Prepare to rinse for a while.,"Overall, this is a great conditioner. It smells amazing and feels really hydrating. My only issue is that, because it’s a thicker consistency, I feel like I have to stay under the shower head forever and a day to rinse all the conditioner off. Otherwise my hair feels thick, gross, and dirty. It’s not the worst problem to have but it is something to keep in mind."

244,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Meh, just okay; it's not bad but it isn't  amazing, either","I have used Maui Moist shampoos and conditioners for several months now. Maybe it's because my hair is so dry and curly ( as in telephone-cord curly), but in my experience, while this brand's shampoos and conditioners certainly do smell nice and are at least as good as any drugstore or supermarket- issued shampoo and conditioner, but I don't find this brand to be all that special in terms of  moisturizing unless I squirt a bunch of argan  oil or coconut oil into the bottle, which I  really shouldn't have to do if this product really did do what is purports to do, right? I mean, it's pretty good and it didn't dry out my scalp or make my hair spontaneously combust  or  fall out or anything drastic like that, and the smell is delicious enough that it keeps me coming back to the brand to buy more, so it certainly isn't terrible or anything, I  just think it should do a better job of moisturizing my hair.  Buying tip for any  savings-minded readers like me: I have only purchased the shampoo and conditioner on Amazon once; once in a local store in my little tiny  hometown in Michigan ; and  once  on eBay, and while it isn't cheap ( remember, this isn't some detergent-laden cheapie  shampoo like Pert or Suave or  whatever); it isn't really expensive, either (I once had a $40 shampoo-- it WAS amazing-- from Italy that I bought from a local  salon  here in Atlanta, but they are always out of it, and that is way out of my budget right now anyway. I found this brand  to cost less on eBay when bought as a shampoo/conditioner set, but of course, shipping with amazon prime is quicker and somewhat cheaper to ship than what one might find on eBay. So this isn't a bad deal, it actually is quite a bit better than buying it at a box store if you can find it (my local Target in Atlanta didn't even carry  this brand when  I  last visited there and wanted to stock up).So I'm back to buying it on Amazon, because I am running low on it and I'm going to want it sooner than later."
245,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT for dry hair!,"I was searching for a ""better"" conditioner since I had JUST cut 2 inches off of my hair 6 weeks ago and it was ALREADY looking fried and dried despite not using any styling tools. I walked down the aisle at Walmart and realized that the conditioners all had water as the first ingredient and some type of alcohol as the second....even as I continued into the more and more expensive brands, they still had alcohol as the second ingredient! I determined that I would find SOMETHING without that drying alcohol ingredient (at least so far near the front) and came upon this.I paid $6.50 for each bottle (I got shampoo, conditioner and the spray oil) hoping for the best but not expecting much. In full disclosure, I also bought Ultra-Swim shampoo to get a good clarifying cleanse before starting this since google searching told me that switching from sulfates to natural cleansers takes a bit of an adjustment that I wanted to avoid (and supposedly my city water has chlorine added so I figured it couldn't hurt to use this stuff.) I did have to shampoo with that Ultra-Swim about 3 times in a row before getting a good suds worked up, but then I got a great suds from this shampoo and realized to my amazement that I could actually run my fingers through my hair during this shampoo stage! Normally I shampoo up, rinse it out, then condition and run my fingers through it to get all the loose hair out--I simply can't run my fingers through UNTIL adding conditioner. Not with this! I was running my fingers through it and through it and through it, amazed at the feeling! The conditioner was just as ""luxurious""...there's no other word for it!I have since washed with just these 2 and I don't get the VAST amount of suds from that first wash, but that's not surprising...I probably would if I shampooed 3 times like I did that first time (but it's not necessary now.) I still get a lot of suds and that conditioned feeling, though. I MIGHT could go without the conditioner and use only the moisturizing shampoo, but my hair is super dry so I won't even try. I haven't had any adjustment period to this (again, could be because of the Ultra-Swim clarification?) What REALLY got me was that google-searching mentioned scratching your head and getting ""dead skin cells"" under your nails (which I totally did) but then they said it was actually the sulfates left over...and sure enough, I don't get that under my nails now! I love this stuff!!!! And I only wash my hair every 3 days, so it will last me a LONG time! I even brought some travel sizes to work to share with a couple of friends, and they're in love, too! But if you don't have dry hair, this is NOT the product for you!"
246,"Maui Moisture Heal & Hydrate + Shea Butter Conditioner to Repair & Deeply Moisturize Tight Curly Hair with Coconut & Macademia Oils, Vegan, Silicone, Paraben & Sulfate-Free, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I would pass,"I tried this set, including the deep conditioner and at first I fell in love.  After many uses of the same bottle, however, I all of a sudden noticed my hair was super tangly and dry and brittle.  I’ve never felt my hair this way before.  I can say in this time, the only changes that I made while I started using this product is less heat and using oils/ creams with no alcohol, so I feel strongly this set is what caused my hair to be so damaged.  Also, I have naturally curly hair that I chemically straighten to give you an idea of my hair type.  Lastly, after following them on Instagram, it looks like this product is a bit controversial as some of their chemicals contain formeldehyde releasers, which is super scary in itself.  Unfortunately, I will no longer be using."

It does 30% of the job. You can't move around yourhair too much because you'll find it harder to detangle. You have to work your way in around the hair. This conditioner works best in one method: parting your hair into smaller sections, next quickly applying and combing through right away, and leaving conditioner to sit for 2-5 minutes (the longer the better) for softening. Finally a second rinse while gently rinsing hands through hair. It makes your hair stiff if you wash away quickly. Not a product i recommend if you don't have the patience to see best results which isnt much"

My hair is so soft and the smell is amazing. I finished by using the Maui Coconut oil mist.. again smells amazing and my hair looks and feels healthy. I have long, extremely thick hair.. I've read that switching to sulfate free is like putting your hair thru detox bc of all the chemicals that are in regular shampoo.. Might take a few weeks before getting the full affect of this shampoo bc of how damaged my hair is but so far so good. I love this. Ordered the Vanilla also.. can't wait to try that one!!!

At least I won't for myself. After a few days I started to notice an itch on my scalp, which later progressed into a rash, almost like burn marks on my scalp. Not fun! Will not be purchasing this again. It also failed when it came to moisturizing my hair, it left its dry, tangled, and lots of breakage."

I bought both the shampoo and conditioner. After the first and final use, it took me an hour to comb through my tangled hair, enough that I could blow dry it.This product made my hair so dry ( almost crunchy), but oily looking, limp, and FULL of STATIC; that I threw away both the shampoo and conditioner after the first use! The only things that are nice about this product are the smell and the advertising. The labels look cool; chemical free this, that, and the other, but the shampoo and conditioner produce awful results! Don't waste your money! Johnson &Johnson baby shampoo makes your hair so super soft, that my son, our Labrador, and I, all use that shampoo and it is fantastic!

It’s fine, 2A wavy, thick density, dry ends/oily roots, AND it’s been highlighted a few times, so the parts that are dry really are dry. I have a lot of problems with products being either too moisturizing and making my roots super oily/causing buildup, or products not being moisturizing enough and stripping my scalp. This shampoo is literally perfect. It has a creamy consistency, foams up really well, cleans my hair and scalp (even after a workout and two days of oil/sweat/dry shampoo), adds moisture, and even does a bit of detangling on its own (especially near my crown, which I desperately need because I usually can’t apply conditioner there). Not only that, but my hair is super soft, shiny, silky, and amazing looking when it dries. This is exactly what my hair needed, and it’s great for my scalp too. If your hair is similar to mine, this product is definitely worth a shot.SHAMPOO UPDATE:I’ve been using this shampoo for two months now, and I stand by my original review. It transforms my hair into silky soft wavy perfection with every wash. It’s absolutely worth every penny.REVIEW FOR THE AGAVE ANTI-BREAKAGE MASK: 5 starsI also bought the hair mask in this line because I wanted to give it a try. The hair mask also Is great from a first impression standpoint. I used it as a deep conditioning treatment after shampooing, and left it in my hair for about 5 minutes before rinsing it out.  After one use, my hair was noticeably softer, moisturized and wavy without being weighed down. It also detangled my hair, which is a huge plus, because I normally struggle with hair deep conditioners not doing enough detangling. All in all seems like a good product. Will keep using/update if I run into problems. Definitely worth the money so far!"

It smells amazing, feels amazing was honestly a little hard to wash out, BUT my hair is crazy porous and was super oily bc I had run out of shampoo and had been using dandruff shampoo that didn’t lather. 😂 After the initial washing today, it got crunchy because I let my hair air dry but then you break that up by just scrunching your hair and YOU GUYS... so soft! Sorry for the run-on sentence but you just need to buy this ish. I’m spoiled. Never going back and no silicones and cruelty free!!! Big deal for me. Maui, keep doing what you do!Update: As great as the sensory experience was, look up the product in the “Think Dirty” app. It has a toxicity of 8. It lists the harmful ingredients for you. I’ve since switched to Acure and Seaweed Co."

Besides that, many people who switch from a commercial shampoo to something more natural without harsh chemicals can have a transition period where their hair and scalp freak out, for lack of better words. They're simply trying to get used to the new product and it can take a few washes. Having been using more natural products for 2-3 years, and picking the right one for my hair type, these are the best products I have found. They leave my hair soft, with little tangles, less hair falls out, less breakage. Overall healthier hair."

I was convinced I was going to have to cut off at least 5 inches due to damage and was worried the longer I waited the more I'd have to cut. My hair would get so tangled all the time, I could never run my hands through it and I was frustrated because it seemed to break and never really grow.I gave Maui a chance because the price was right, but I didn't expect much. I was just out of conditioner in my shower. But after the first wash I noticed my hair was not the same. It was as though I had just come from the salon. My ends weren't looking like they'd been electrocuted; and looking at individual strands I didn't see the split ends. I can brush my hair in the am (which doesn't get totally tangled at night any more) and it stays soft and smooth all day.  I am so happy my hair looks so much healthier. I immediately replaced my shampoo and styling products with Maui. I am still in shock after a couple weeks at how nice my hair looks. I can't wait for my stylist to see it! Now instead of a bob, I may actually achieve my goal of hair down to my ribs!Btw, my hair is caucasian and fine and you might think this product would make my hair greasy, but it doesn't at all. I even used a few drops on towel dried hair and used it as a leave in, and my hair just sucks it up!"

Amazon has the best price I can find- dont purchase at Ulta. This is the only shampoo my daughter and I both can use otherwise double the costs for two shampoos and two conditioners with no extra space. We have a tiny apartment so there is limited space even with an over the shower caddy. We love the great results on my colored grey dry hair and her oil producing hair. We also love the fact Maui moisture is Sulfate-Free Surfactants, Parabens Free & 100% Aloe Juice first ingredient and all the other natural ingredients. My daughter is very particular about products she will purchase and use as she is vegan, limits chemicals and wants animal cruelty free."

I have wavy/curly hair that is damaged from heat and dye. I tried several brands and several products but THIS is the only shampoo that cleans my hair without making it feel dried out. My hair stays soft and it’s not weighted down. The brand also makes products that are vegan, sulfate free, paraben free and silicone free which is a plus.I started ordering it from Amazon because I can never find it anywhere in the stores: I tried Ulta, Target, Walmart and Meijer’s and they’re always out of this specific one.

Unfortunately disappointed. I have very thick and coarse hair. My hair has been falling out more and more. I saw this shampoo at my local pharmacy love the ingredients and wanted to give it a try. My texture did not improve it’s still very dry and brittle. After applying the conditioner usually the next day my hair as an awful greasy oily film. And as far as strengthening my hair I haven’t really noticed a difference still falling out. The good thing about for me is that I love smell of it. Some people say expensive brands aren’t all what they’re cracked up to be in my case that doesn’t hold true I will be going back to my more expensive brand shampoo because I know it works and it delivers results.

It dried out my hair really bad and it began to break off a lot at the top of my head. You can see it bad when I braid my hair. Using this product my hair isn’t greasy AT ALL and my hair is soooo soft and moisturized! It feels rich and healthy!!!! It looks vibrant and soft and smells soooooooo good and fresh!

One of them has long straight thin hair that started breaking and first use of this softened her hair up and stopped the breakage.

But what I hate about it is the price listed here on Amazon. At target I would buy shampoo and conditioner for less than $15 and on Amazon on spending more than $15 for both. That’s ridiculous. If I’m going to be spending more than $15 on shampoo and conditioner combined I might as well just get an actual pricey shampoo and conditioner.I don’t understand why it’s so pricey here.

154,"OGX, Maui Moisture Strength AntiBreakage + Moisturizing Agave Conditioner for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair Vegan Silicone ParabenFree SulfateFree Surfactants, hibiscus, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the Smell, helped with breakage but not good for a leave in","Some Background: I have really curly, low-porosity hair. I also deal with a lot of breakage due to my hair being thin. That being said, most styling products leave my hair anywhere from dry and brittle to stiff and flat. As a result I dont bother with mousse, gels or sprays. I only use conditioners to style my hair which my hair absolutely loves.This Product: ROCKS for anti breakage for me. I've only been using it for a week. My hair didn't care for it as a styling product even when i diluted it with filtered water to use as a leave in to style with. It sort of left my hair looking sticky even tough it wasn't. But i noticed a significant difference in the amount of hair I was losing when i shampooed with Matrix Amplify shampoo and then used Maui Moisture.Conclusion: I will save this to use on weekends. I usually slather a moisturizing conditioner in m hair and put it up in a braided bun, then wash it after a couple of hours. I tried it one and my hair felt soft and moisturized afterwards. I will be trying other Maui products. The picture below is for you to see what my hair looks like. This was with the Maui moisture put in this morning to style with until i get my Redken Curvaceous leave in conditioner.SMELLS AMAZING!!!!!"

I have very curly and pretty dry hair and had read reviews as this being one of the best affordable curly hair brands. I had seen on the label anti breakage so I chose this out of the rest and after one wash I was super happy with the results. This being said, I had used a deep conditioner right before. After two days, I used it again and got very different results. My hair felt very stringy and snapped when i pulled it. I also got that halo of frizz that drives me nuts. I thought this was so weird as my hair after using moisturizing products usually feels very healthy. I decided to check the bottle for ingredients and I am so glad I did. Maui Moisture claims to be sulfate free but as I was reading the bottle, I came across Olefin Sulfanate, Sodium Chloride and Hydroxysultaine as well as a few others that are very heavy dupes for Sulfates. I was very disappointed in the misleading product and to be honest kind of sad to see a brand that seems so trustworthy with product quality sneak things that made my hair even worse. Will not be purchasing from Maui Moisture again"
182,"OGX, Maui Moisture Strength AntiBreakage + Moisturizing Agave Conditioner for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair Vegan Silicone ParabenFree SulfateFree Surfactants, hibiscus, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells AMAZING, and still does the trick!","Hello! So a little about this thirsty mane of mine! It's very short (shoulder length) thick, dense, dark and CURLY (3C/4A) and this just did the most wonderful thing. After using their shampoo (Vanilla Bean is my favorite), I was ringing out my hair in sections and then I'd take this conditioner and it literally sank right into my strands (disclaimer: high porosity) under the warm water and my goodness (my curls popped), once I worked it into every section and braided it down with the conditioner still on it gave me so much slip!!! So I covered it with a plastic cap and did my towel turban thing after I finished off with a shower and rinsed this out with cold water (which felt so good btw) and hours later after drying my hair with an old tshirt my hair not only felt so soft and smelled INCREDIBLE, but their whole line together genuinely makes my hair retain so much MOISTURE! I definitely say get it!! I mix and match their product line scents how they work for me but there's no way you're gonna be disappointed! Serious slip. Bang for your buck. Can't go wrong! Plus it's vegan so knock yourself out!"
183,"OGX, Maui Moisture Strength AntiBreakage + Moisturizing Agave Conditioner for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair Vegan Silicone ParabenFree SulfateFree Surfactants, hibiscus, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the worse thing but definately not the best,I purchased this and the conditioner from the local Walmart. I dye my hair and bleach it often anyways so I try this product because it was so to be all natural and who doesn't want that kind of lifestyle. my hair is not really oily at all but this dried out my hair its by far one of the worse products I have used. Good luck if you try it and for those who don't be glad you didn't.
184,"OGX, Maui Moisture Strength AntiBreakage + Moisturizing Agave Conditioner for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair Vegan Silicone ParabenFree SulfateFree Surfactants, hibiscus, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Based on the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites it seemed like you either loved it or hated it,"I was skeptical about this product. Based on the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites it seemed like you either loved it or hated it, no in between. I personally love it. Maybe it depends on hair type. A bit of background on me..I'm 27, with hair that has been dyed since I was about 14. Currently its dyed blonde. I try to wash my hair only every other day and blow dry it. My hair also tends to be poofy so I also heat style with a flat iron pretty much every day. I had serious breakage issues. After the first wash my hair felt much better. Before you could touch parts of my hair and you could feel the almost straw like damage, and now while it is not completely gone it is much better. Smell is great too. With most products that lean more towards the natural side it can be a bit harder to work it through you hair and get it to soap up, especially if you have other products in your hair, but I found that to be no problem really. It can be slightly hard to get out of the bottles because its so thick, but not so difficult I would consider not using this. I personally have not had problems with hair falling out like other posters. The great thing about this product? Its relatively cheap. I had a $20 bottle of shampoo in my hand, when I put it back and decided to go with this. For the cost of less than $10 why not try it? You may be one of the ones who love it."
185,"OGX, Maui Moisture Strength AntiBreakage + Moisturizing Agave Conditioner for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair Vegan Silicone ParabenFree SulfateFree Surfactants, hibiscus, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,INCREASE in breakage!,"I want to start by saying that I absolutely love the scent of this shampoo and conditioner. The scent also seems to stay with you longer than other brands, but unfortunately that is where the positive things end for this duo.Contrary to what the bottle says, I have actually seen a INCREASE in breakage since I've started using this shampoo and conditioner a month ago. The conditioner also leaves a very heavy residue on my hair, making it feel like I haven't washed it in days. I can't even run my fingers through my hair because it feels almost like it's trying to mat. My hair has never done this with any other top brand shampoo and conditioners.Incredibly disappointed in this brand and will not be buying again, nor will I be recommending this product to anyone! Do your hair a favor and stay away from this shampoo and conditioner!"
186,"OGX, Maui Moisture Strength AntiBreakage + Moisturizing Agave Conditioner for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair Vegan Silicone ParabenFree SulfateFree Surfactants, hibiscus, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely LOVE Maui Moisture,"I bought this, along with matching conditioner, at a local store and I absolutely LOVE it.  My hair hasn't been this wonderful in years.  I have less breakage and fallout after using the anti-breakage for 2 months now.  My hair is stronger, and getting back to its thickness, very quickly.  The scent is lovely for summer.  I'll be switching to the Thicken and Restore system once I'm done with the anti-breakage.  I'm excited to be using this product!"
187,"OGX, Maui Moisture Strength AntiBreakage + Moisturizing Agave Conditioner for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair Vegan Silicone ParabenFree SulfateFree Surfactants, hibiscus, 13 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Another let down,"I just recently purchased the shampoo and conditioner and have been using it for almost 1 month. It smells really good and the smell stays but that's the only positive about this. I feel like there is a residue left on my hair that makes it feel dirty and almost matted. I had very high hopes but my hair is left feeling dirty, dry and knotted. Do not recommend , definitely if you have colored your hair or use heat on it."

I do pre shampoo oil treatments on my hair overnight. With a lot of shampoos I have to either use a ton, or do two washes. I had to use very little of this product to get a fantastic lather.

Not only is it free from gluten ( I have an allergy, so that is important to me!) But it's also free from sulfate and many other chemicals. This shampoo and conditioner have changed my hair drastically. The frizziness of my hair has greatly diminished, the volume has increased. This is the only conditioner I've used that feels like it's actually working, rinses out with ease and does not leave my hair feeling greasy. I also use the conditioner on my legs for shaving. My legs are extremely sensitive and this conditioner leaves them sit, moisturized and helps provide a close shave. An absolute favorite for me!"

It's heavy, weighted down, greasy (at the roots), frizzy (at the ends), dry, my curls are gone, and my blonde highlights are very faded and brassy.

0,"Maui Moisture Strength & Anti-Breakage + Moisturizing Agave Shampoo for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair, Vegan, Silicone- & Paraben-Free with Sulfate-Free Surfactants, 13 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SHAMPOO REVIEW: 5 starsMy hair type is a pain to find good products for. It’s fine, 2A wavy, thick density, dry ends/oily roots, AND it’s been highlighted a few times, so the parts that are dry really are dry. I have a lot of problems with products being either too moisturizing and making my roots super oily/causing buildup, or products not being moisturizing enough and stripping my scalp. This shampoo is literally perfect. It has a creamy consistency, foams up really well, cleans my hair and scalp (even after a workout and two days of oil/sweat/dry shampoo), adds moisture, and even does a bit of detangling on its own (especially near my crown, which I desperately need because I usually can’t apply conditioner there). Not only that, but my hair is super soft, shiny, silky, and amazing looking when it dries. This is exactly what my hair needed, and it’s great for my scalp too. If your hair is similar to mine, this product is definitely worth a shot.SHAMPOO UPDATE:I’ve been using this shampoo for two months now, and I stand by my original review. It transforms my hair into silky soft wavy perfection with every wash. It’s absolutely worth every penny.REVIEW FOR THE AGAVE ANTI-BREAKAGE MASK: 5 starsI also bought the hair mask in this line because I wanted to give it a try. The hair mask also Is great from a first impression standpoint. I used it as a deep conditioning treatment after shampooing, and left it in my hair for about 5 minutes before rinsing it out.  After one use, my hair was noticeably softer, moisturized and wavy without being weighed down. It also detangled my hair, which is a huge plus, because I normally struggle with hair deep conditioners not doing enough detangling. All in all seems like a good product. Will keep using/update if I run into problems. Definitely worth the money so far!"

It smells amazing, feels amazing was honestly a little hard to wash out, BUT my hair is crazy porous and was super oily bc I had run out of shampoo and had been using dandruff shampoo that didn’t lather. 😂 After the initial washing today, it got crunchy because I let my hair air dry but then you break that up by just scrunching your hair and YOU GUYS... so soft! Sorry for the run-on sentence but you just need to buy this ish. I’m spoiled. Never going back and no silicones and cruelty free!!! Big deal for me. Maui, keep doing what you do!Update: As great as the sensory experience was, look up the product in the “Think Dirty” app. It has a toxicity of 8. It lists the harmful ingredients for you. I’ve since switched to Acure and Seaweed Co."

Besides that, many people who switch from a commercial shampoo to something more natural without harsh chemicals can have a transition period where their hair and scalp freak out, for lack of better words. They're simply trying to get used to the new product and it can take a few washes. Having been using more natural products for 2-3 years, and picking the right one for my hair type, these are the best products I have found. They leave my hair soft, with little tangles, less hair falls out, less breakage. Overall healthier hair."

I was convinced I was going to have to cut off at least 5 inches due to damage and was worried the longer I waited the more I'd have to cut. My hair would get so tangled all the time, I could never run my hands through it and I was frustrated because it seemed to break and never really grow.I gave Maui a chance because the price was right, but I didn't expect much. I was just out of conditioner in my shower. But after the first wash I noticed my hair was not the same. It was as though I had just come from the salon. My ends weren't looking like they'd been electrocuted; and looking at individual strands I didn't see the split ends. I can brush my hair in the am (which doesn't get totally tangled at night any more) and it stays soft and smooth all day.  I am so happy my hair looks so much healthier. I immediately replaced my shampoo and styling products with Maui. I am still in shock after a couple weeks at how nice my hair looks. I can't wait for my stylist to see it! Now instead of a bob, I may actually achieve my goal of hair down to my ribs!Btw, my hair is caucasian and fine and you might think this product would make my hair greasy, but it doesn't at all. I even used a few drops on towel dried hair and used it as a leave in, and my hair just sucks it up!"

Amazon has the best price I can find- dont purchase at Ulta. This is the only shampoo my daughter and I both can use otherwise double the costs for two shampoos and two conditioners with no extra space. We have a tiny apartment so there is limited space even with an over the shower caddy. We love the great results on my colored grey dry hair and her oil producing hair. We also love the fact Maui moisture is Sulfate-Free Surfactants, Parabens Free & 100% Aloe Juice first ingredient and all the other natural ingredients. My daughter is very particular about products she will purchase and use as she is vegan, limits chemicals and wants animal cruelty free."

I have wavy/curly hair that is damaged from heat and dye. I tried several brands and several products but THIS is the only shampoo that cleans my hair without making it feel dried out. My hair stays soft and it’s not weighted down. The brand also makes products that are vegan, sulfate free, paraben free and silicone free which is a plus.I started ordering it from Amazon because I can never find it anywhere in the stores: I tried Ulta, Target, Walmart and Meijer’s and they’re always out of this specific one. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was so popular cause it works really well!"

Unfortunately disappointed. I have very thick and coarse hair. My hair has been falling out more and more. I saw this shampoo at my local pharmacy love the ingredients and wanted to give it a try. My texture did not improve it’s still very dry and brittle. After applying the conditioner usually the next day my hair as an awful greasy oily film. And as far as strengthening my hair I haven’t really noticed a difference still falling out. The good thing about for me is that I love smell of it. Some people say expensive brands aren’t all what they’re cracked up to be in my case that doesn’t hold true I will be going back to my more expensive brand shampoo because I know it works and it delivers results.

I’m 18 and have always struggled with my thick hair having greasy roots, but my ends getting dry and poofy. I’ve been using a lot of really drying and stripping hair products just cause I couldn’t handle having greasy hair anymore. It dried out my hair really bad and it began to break off a lot at the top of my head. You can see it bad when I braid my hair. Using this product my hair isn’t greasy AT ALL and my hair is soooo soft and moisturized! It feels rich and healthy!!!! It looks vibrant and soft and smells soooooooo good and fresh!

One of them has long straight thin hair that started breaking and first use of this softened her hair up and stopped the breakage. The other daughter has thin short curly hair that gets matted really bad in back. This actually helps so much in getting tangles out. I've started aged the conditioner to a spray bottle with water as a detangler. Great stuff!

But what I hate about it is the price listed here on Amazon. At target I would buy shampoo and conditioner for less than $15 and on Amazon on spending more than $15 for both. That’s ridiculous. If I’m going to be spending more than $15 on shampoo and conditioner combined I might as well just get an actual pricey shampoo and conditioner.I don’t understand why it’s so pricey here.

154,"Maui Moisture Strength & Anti-Breakage + Moisturizing Agave Shampoo for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair, Vegan, Silicone- & Paraben-Free with Sulfate-Free Surfactants, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the Smell, helped with breakage but not good for a leave in","Some Background: I have really curly, low-porosity hair. I also deal with a lot of breakage due to my hair being thin. That being said, most styling products leave my hair anywhere from dry and brittle to stiff and flat. As a result I dont bother with mousse, gels or sprays. I only use conditioners to style my hair which my hair absolutely loves.This Product: ROCKS for anti breakage for me. I've only been using it for a week. My hair didn't care for it as a styling product even when i diluted it with filtered water to use as a leave in to style with. It sort of left my hair looking sticky even tough it wasn't. But i noticed a significant difference in the amount of hair I was losing when i shampooed with Matrix Amplify shampoo and then used Maui Moisture.Conclusion: I will save this to use on weekends. I usually slather a moisturizing conditioner in m hair and put it up in a braided bun, then wash it after a couple of hours. I tried it one and my hair felt soft and moisturized afterwards. I will be trying other Maui products. The picture below is for you to see what my hair looks like. This was with the Maui moisture put in this morning to style with until i get my Redken Curvaceous leave in conditioner.SMELLS AMAZING!!!!!"

I have very curly and pretty dry hair and had read reviews as this being one of the best affordable curly hair brands. I had seen on the label anti breakage so I chose this out of the rest and after one wash I was super happy with the results. This being said, I had used a deep conditioner right before. After two days, I used it again and got very different results. My hair felt very stringy and snapped when i pulled it. I also got that halo of frizz that drives me nuts. I thought this was so weird as my hair after using moisturizing products usually feels very healthy. I decided to check the bottle for ingredients and I am so glad I did. Maui Moisture claims to be sulfate free but as I was reading the bottle, I came across Olefin Sulfanate, Sodium Chloride and Hydroxysultaine as well as a few others that are very heavy dupes for Sulfates. I was very disappointed in the misleading product and to be honest kind of sad to see a brand that seems so trustworthy with product quality sneak things that made my hair even worse. Will not be purchasing from Maui Moisture again"
182,"Maui Moisture Strength & Anti-Breakage + Moisturizing Agave Shampoo for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair, Vegan, Silicone- & Paraben-Free with Sulfate-Free Surfactants, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells AMAZING, and still does the trick!","Hello! So a little about this thirsty mane of mine! It's very short (shoulder length) thick, dense, dark and CURLY (3C/4A) and this just did the most wonderful thing. After using their shampoo (Vanilla Bean is my favorite), I was ringing out my hair in sections and then I'd take this conditioner and it literally sank right into my strands (disclaimer: high porosity) under the warm water and my goodness (my curls popped), once I worked it into every section and braided it down with the conditioner still on it gave me so much slip!!! So I covered it with a plastic cap and did my towel turban thing after I finished off with a shower and rinsed this out with cold water (which felt so good btw) and hours later after drying my hair with an old tshirt my hair not only felt so soft and smelled INCREDIBLE, but their whole line together genuinely makes my hair retain so much MOISTURE! I definitely say get it!! I mix and match their product line scents how they work for me but there's no way you're gonna be disappointed! Serious slip. Bang for your buck. Can't go wrong! Plus it's vegan so knock yourself out!"
183,"Maui Moisture Strength & Anti-Breakage + Moisturizing Agave Shampoo for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair, Vegan, Silicone- & Paraben-Free with Sulfate-Free Surfactants, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the worse thing but definately not the best,I purchased this and the conditioner from the local Walmart. I dye my hair and bleach it often anyways so I try this product because it was so to be all natural and who doesn't want that kind of lifestyle. my hair is not really oily at all but this dried out my hair its by far one of the worse products I have used. Good luck if you try it and for those who don't be glad you didn't.
184,"Maui Moisture Strength & Anti-Breakage + Moisturizing Agave Shampoo for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair, Vegan, Silicone- & Paraben-Free with Sulfate-Free Surfactants, 13 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Based on the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites it seemed like you either loved it or hated it,"I was skeptical about this product. Based on the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites it seemed like you either loved it or hated it, no in between. I personally love it. Maybe it depends on hair type. A bit of background on me..I'm 27, with hair that has been dyed since I was about 14. Currently its dyed blonde. I try to wash my hair only every other day and blow dry it. My hair also tends to be poofy so I also heat style with a flat iron pretty much every day. I had serious breakage issues. After the first wash my hair felt much better. Before you could touch parts of my hair and you could feel the almost straw like damage, and now while it is not completely gone it is much better. Smell is great too. With most products that lean more towards the natural side it can be a bit harder to work it through you hair and get it to soap up, especially if you have other products in your hair, but I found that to be no problem really. It can be slightly hard to get out of the bottles because its so thick, but not so difficult I would consider not using this. I personally have not had problems with hair falling out like other posters. The great thing about this product? Its relatively cheap. I had a $20 bottle of shampoo in my hand, when I put it back and decided to go with this. For the cost of less than $10 why not try it? You may be one of the ones who love it."
185,"Maui Moisture Strength & Anti-Breakage + Moisturizing Agave Shampoo for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair, Vegan, Silicone- & Paraben-Free with Sulfate-Free Surfactants, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,INCREASE in breakage!,"I want to start by saying that I absolutely love the scent of this shampoo and conditioner. The scent also seems to stay with you longer than other brands, but unfortunately that is where the positive things end for this duo.Contrary to what the bottle says, I have actually seen a INCREASE in breakage since I've started using this shampoo and conditioner a month ago. The conditioner also leaves a very heavy residue on my hair, making it feel like I haven't washed it in days. I can't even run my fingers through my hair because it feels almost like it's trying to mat. My hair has never done this with any other top brand shampoo and conditioners.Incredibly disappointed in this brand and will not be buying again, nor will I be recommending this product to anyone! Do your hair a favor and stay away from this shampoo and conditioner!"
186,"Maui Moisture Strength & Anti-Breakage + Moisturizing Agave Shampoo for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair, Vegan, Silicone- & Paraben-Free with Sulfate-Free Surfactants, 13 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely LOVE Maui Moisture,"I bought this, along with matching conditioner, at a local store and I absolutely LOVE it.  My hair hasn't been this wonderful in years.  I have less breakage and fallout after using the anti-breakage for 2 months now.  My hair is stronger, and getting back to its thickness, very quickly.  The scent is lovely for summer.  I'll be switching to the Thicken and Restore system once I'm done with the anti-breakage.  I'm excited to be using this product!"
187,"Maui Moisture Strength & Anti-Breakage + Moisturizing Agave Shampoo for Color Treated or Chemically Damaged Hair, Vegan, Silicone- & Paraben-Free with Sulfate-Free Surfactants, 13 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Another let down,"I just recently purchased the shampoo and conditioner and have been using it for almost 1 month. It smells really good and the smell stays but that's the only positive about this. I feel like there is a residue left on my hair that makes it feel dirty and almost matted. I had very high hopes but my hair is left feeling dirty, dry and knotted. Do not recommend , definitely if you have colored your hair or use heat on it."

I do pre shampoo oil treatments on my hair overnight. With a lot of shampoos I have to either use a ton, or do two washes. I had to use very little of this product to get a fantastic lather.

Not only is it free from gluten ( I have an allergy, so that is important to me!) But it's also free from sulfate and many other chemicals. This shampoo and conditioner have changed my hair drastically. The frizziness of my hair has greatly diminished, the volume has increased. This is the only conditioner I've used that feels like it's actually working, rinses out with ease and does not leave my hair feeling greasy. I also use the conditioner on my legs for shaving. My legs are extremely sensitive and this conditioner leaves them sit, moisturized and helps provide a close shave. An absolute favorite for me!"

In fact, I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to work at all until I got the shampoo and used both together. The shampoo, on the other hand, works quite well without its matching conditioner."

Lefty hair so dry, literally felt like i could feed a horse a handful of my hair, is how dry it was. ""Hay"" It is so extra tangled, worse then already was.

It might almost be a little too gentle, though, because when I use a heavy conditioner, it never feels like it quite rinses clean.

It goes into hair well. More importantly...it rinses well. The peppermint oil gives it a really pleasant smell and experience.It does a pretty decent job at making my hair reasonably happy. It's not perfect, but it's a lot closer than a lot of the things I've tried recently.It's reasonably affordable as well...depending on how long your hair is of course."
14,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have tried a few other varieties from this line and always been impressed.This is a great shampoo that cleans hair well and as it contains peppermint oil, it leaves your scalp slightly tingling but in a good way.It is also very moisturizing and does not strip color and though it is designed for curly hair, it will work well for all hair types.Great shampoo and would buy this again"
15,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"An average hair conditioner.  Nothing extraordinary but good ingredients.  Less toxic than most.  I use a number of ""clean beauty"" hair conditioners and so I hold this one up to those that I know and love.  One in particular that I love is by ""Bread"" and it is also for curly hair.  It performs way better than this one.  I needed a lot of conditioner with the Maui product to feel like it as doing anything.  It is a pass from me."
16,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a brand that I have used often. I was excited to try a new scent. This smells great. The scent is unique and different from anything I have tried. Similar to their other conditioners, it is very thick and takes a while to get out of the bottle. Also I feel I use more of this than other conditioners. But I still love the brand and how it leaves my hair feeling. Overall I really like this."
17,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Maui Moisture Hair Care Strength & Length Castor & Neem Oil Shampoo is suitable for damaged and transitioning curls. This product strengthens, hydrates and renews hair with castor oil, Neem oil and peppermint oil. It is free of mineral oil, silicones, parabens, gluten, SLS and synthetic dyes. This product is great for everyday use and gifting!I highly recommend this product!"
18,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My daughter with 3A type curly hair really likes this shampoo.  I am a 1A (super straight hair) so I didn't try this.  This shampoo smells nice, not the typical coconut-y scent but a peppermint scent, but it's not strong.  It has no parabens or silicones but has beneficial oils.  Aloe is the first ingredient, not water!  I like that this is a quality shampoo but doesn't cost a fortune."
19,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great,"This shampoo smells great and lathers well. It's super hydrating...maybe too hydrating actually. I have curly hair and definitely need the moisture, but this left my hair a little weighed down. It's the perfect shampoo to use once a week to get that extra little bit of oil in my hair, but I don't think I can use it as my everyday shampoo."
20,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Maui shampoo is amazing! This smells nice and fresh and really helps my dry hair. This adds bounce and makes my hair easy to style.In addition to smelling great and making my hair full and healthier looking, I din’t need conditioner after using it because it works so well to detangle and soften my hair. This is a really good shampoo."
21,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This Shampoo Works Very Well On Dry Hair,"My dry, middle-aged hair really likes this shampoo.  End results are a more natural feel and texture—the oils in this don’t weigh down hair, but simply add needed hydration.  So far every Maui hair product I’ve tried has turned out to be a winner—this one is no exception, and works very well on dry hair like mine."
22,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smoothing, moisturizing conditioner, good for dry curly hair. The texture is thick, more like a hair mask and hard to squeeze out of the bottle. It does make my hair hydrated and manageable. The bottle is a bit small but the price is not high either. Overall 4 stars out of 5."
23,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a really nice shampoo from a company that makes great shampoos.  This one has oils that are great for curly hair and make it soft and shiny after washing.  It has a nice clean smell and does a great job cleaning and moisturizing at the same time.

I get very dry hair and this shampoo helped immensely.  It has a really pleasant aroma and makes a great lather.  I just love the smell!  If you have dry hair definitely try this out, it helped me!"
25,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff is awesome. It is thick and rich. It smells nice and shampoos up a thick lather. It helps moisturize your hair but I wouldn't use it without a conditioner. I have long thick wavy hair. This works best of kinkyer curls.
26,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and works even better. My daughter has such thick hair. It makes it a lot easier to brush and keeps it soft

28,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,I like that my hair feels softer after use. I want to see after 6 months of use will there be a significant difference in my texture.  I like natural ingredients thats why I chose this product.

Cómo estoy en etapa de dejar crecer debo usar productos fortificantes para mi cabello y este cumple con estas características. El shampoo limpia muy bien, huele muy bien y nada exagerado."
31,"Maui Moisture Strength & Length + Castor & Neem Oil Conditioner, Curly Hair Product for Dry, Damaged Hair, 13 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Castor oil has always complimented my hair so when I saw this I had to try it. The scent is pleasant and it leaves my hair with the moisturized how I like it.
