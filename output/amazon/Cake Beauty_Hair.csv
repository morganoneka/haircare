0,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,I recommend this to everyone o have 3C/4A hair thats pretty wild and this is one of 2 products I use! I love the cake line!
1,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's not for me,"Last two pictures are when it pretty much dried, after the second attempt. I just received this yesterday, used a natural shampoo and conditioner. It smells great, very sticky, made my hair look shiny/greasy, my hair feels and looks dry, soft, greasy and crisp. It didn't do anything for my waves, that I can't do by just scrunching my hair without products. I'm definitely going with a spray.My hair is long, fine, naturally curls when wet, frizzes and still has waves on average."
2,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful sweet bouncy curls!,"Great curl cream for a light definition and wonderful sweet smell. I use this everyday I want bouncy airy curls. Best for AIR DRY- if you must blow dry, ONLY dry your roots for the cream to work to define curls. I held back one star just because my cheaper go-to curl cream by Tresemme is better at defining my curls, but it does not smell as wonderful as Cake. I may try mixing them together üòÅ"
3,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me...,"Love the scent but that‚Äôs where it ends.  It‚Äôs really sticky and just weighed down my fine, curly, locks!  Nice product but did nothing but make hair feel heavy, sticky and straightened out.  I expected the opposite.  Perhaps not for fine, curly hair."
4,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,My curls are back!!,With the pandemic and the lack of haircuts I rediscovered my curly hair. I did have a reversed angle Bob for the past three and a half years. As my hair grew out over months before my beautician opened back up I saw my curly hair. So I've had two haircuts since then and now my curls look excellent. I love cake body products so I thought I'd try this curl cream. It works great for me makes a huge difference in the amount and shape of my curls. Never knew I had curly hair till I turned 40. I'll be 54 next week and rocking my curls again!
5,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cake üç∞  cake üéÇcake üßÅ,"First, it smells Devine, but because I have a lot of hair, it takes a good bit; A ‚Äúhealthy dollop‚Äù if you will.  It left my hair feeling soft and didn‚Äôt weigh down my curls  But allowed them to have some great Length. I will buy again at this price ( I typically purchase miss Jessie‚Äôs pillow-soft curls, but every time it‚Äôs like a dollar More each time )."
6,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the cost,"This is the most reasonable priced curly hair product I've found. I originally got a little tube from my ipsy order, and I liked it so much, I came to Amazon to order a full-sized bottle.It doesn't make my hair crunchy or greasy, even if I accidentally put too much on. My curls look natural and bouncy after using my diffuser, and even when I let hair air dry, this gives my curls a little extra form and structure to look like I actually did something to my hair."
7,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Maybe I Got a Bad Batch?,"First, I have to clarify that this review is more aimed at the version of this product that I bought from Amazon, not the curl cream in general (which I love and give five stars to all across the board; my curls love Cake‚Äôs The Curl Friend).So, usually I get Cake‚Äôs products directly from a local store, but when I saw Amazon was carrying their products, I decided to give it a shot. The scent of Cake‚Äôs The Curl Friend is usually so pleasant and sweet. Exactly like cake, lol. I *love* it.But after trying the version of this product I purchased from Amazon (twice to be sure), I can confirm that it has a weird fishy smell to it that is NOT typical for any of Cake‚Äôs products I have used in the past. It‚Äôs strong and very unpleasant.I will be returning this to Amazon and going back to my local store to get more The Curl Friend. After receiving a tampered-with version of Cake‚Äôs The Thick Trick a few days ago (I had my old bottle to compare it to, thank goodness, and Amazon did immediately send me a replacement bottle that was very clearly *not* tampered with, to their credit), I‚Äôve learned my lesson. Will stick to local stores for Cake products now. üòÖI don‚Äôt know if this is a regular occurrence with Amazon and Cake‚Äôs products‚Äîthis could very well be an anomaly and I just got a bad batch‚Äîbut I figured I‚Äôd share just so people can be aware and keep an eye out on their own Cake purchases from Amazon in the future.On a happier note, I do highly recommend The Curl Friend itself if you have curly hair and are on the fence. It‚Äôs helped take the frizz from my dry curls and add some moisture and definition, and it hasn‚Äôt weighed my curls down, either. Also, again‚Äîthe scent IS usually the best, light and sweet."
8,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"How to really style curly hair, ok ?!","First off- too many reviews about the ‚Äúbad scent‚Äù. The smell of a product is subjective. The scent smells slightly like bubble gum and light cinnamon mixed. So if ya like that- great. If not- move along to another product.Second - I think too many don‚Äôt understand how to really apply product and care for curly hair.I bought the shampoo, conditioner, and styling cream set. My hair gets used to products and I have to switch up occasionally. This is my switch up product. Upon first use, my hair is extremely soft, shiny, flexible and bouncy.Assuming you know how to shampoo and condition your own hair lol let‚Äôs skip to the styling cream. It should not leave your hair sticky, stringy, straw like, greasy etc. If It does you are using it incorrectly. I prefer to apply to my hair upside down but that‚Äôs up to you. Firstly, when you get out of the shower gently remove some excess water with your hands by cupping your hair in hands from the bottom and pushing up. Do this several times until you have removed about 20% of the dripping water from your hair. Don‚Äôt soak up 90% of the water from your hair by wrapping it in your terry cloth towel. Then, put a dime size amount of product in your hands and rub then together to spread the product around. Now gently pat the product through your your strands, in sections. We‚Äôre not trying to flatten our hair between our hands pulling down here. The point of leaving water in your hair for this step is to let the product and water in your hair mix some and soak into your hair. Get dressed, walk around a few minutes, brush your teeth or whatever to give it a few minutes. Now here‚Äôs the best step- don‚Äôt scrunch your hair with a towel. Grab an old t shirt and scrunch your hair to now absorb the water out. Air dry or diffuse from here. Also, STOP touching your hair while it‚Äôs wet and even damp. Let it dry completely. My blow dryer recently took a poop so I wish I could test diffusing because my hair comes out completely different. But air drying came out great like I would expect."
9,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, smell isn't strong at all","Since I'm absolutely crazy about anything smelly (good smelly not bad smelly) and that was really the biggest appeal for me when I chose to try this product that's where I'll begin. The first thing I did was open the tube up and took a big whiff and I immediately smelled.. Nothing. I sniffed a few more times than used it after my shower and than I came on Amazon to make sure I hadn't ordered the one product in the cake line that just so happened to be Short story longüòâit's not fragrance free so I than went and squeezed a big glob out and sure enough I could smell it.. Sort of. So yes it has a good smell but no it's not even close to overpowering.  In regards to how well it works I'd sa in still glad I bought it. I love the fact that it can be used on dry hair as well which eliminates the need to buy another product for touch ups or next day hair. I've included some pictures and they were all taken after having my hair up in a bun. The first one is a few hours after washing and the other two are the next day. I also showed the amount I use which is not alot. It leaves my curls soft and really maintains them for a long time with very little if any frizz. The only thing I've noticed is my hair seems to get a slightly oily look as the day goes on. I'm not sure if this stuff has any claim to make hair shiny because the oiliness is just a step beyond that look.  Anywho, it's a decent product and works well right after washing hair as well as for touch ups or between washes."
10,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING FOR FINE CURLY HAIR,"I absolutely love this product. I have fine, curly, 3b hair. I use my fingers to comb a tiny amount of this product into my hair after showering or rinsing my hair in the sink (on non-wash days)‚Äî and it‚Äôs keeps my curls glossy, bouncy, and full. I AM AMAZED by how well this product works. After using the product and sleeping on my curls, I will wake up with fully intact curls. I was skeptical, yet this product turned out to be one of my favorites. The scent is really sweet, but it isn‚Äôt too overpowering. My boyfriend complements the way it smells."
11,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!,"My hair is bleached and dyed. I've tried my best to keep it in good condition--bleaching usually destroys my curl and makes my hair brittle, dry and crunchy. Between using oil-laden bleaching products and Olaplex no.0, I've retained my curl but my hair does tangle more than usual, probably because it did get dry still. I've been using a boar bristle brush to distribute my natural oils and it has helped (also to reduce the oiliness of my scalp), but I needed something more. I've been looking for a curl activator to give my curls some more life and found this one here on Amazon. So I decided to give it a try because of the great reviews.So, it really does smell like cake. Wow! I like that more than I thought I would. A little goes a long way. The results are exactly what I want. Soft, bouncy curls so it feels perfectly natural. There's no greasy feeling or residue, and I'm OCD so it wouldn't get past me if it had any. So I couldn't keep my hands out of my hair after blow drying.The first pic is immediately after drying. The second pic is 5 days later, with no extra products. I would say it's a little more wavy than usual at this point, more shiny, less dry and less tangled. I couldn't love this product more and will keep buying it as long as it works this well! (Or better. Is that even possible?)(My hair color is Arctic Fox Electric Paradise. It's UV reactive so it looks a bit different in color based on the light.)"
12,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have fine, frizzy, wavy hair, don't use too much.....","Though they advertise this product as ""feather light,"" it totally isn't. I have fine wavy hair and I'm always looking for light cream products because they're the only thing that works on my hair. This product made my hair shiny, which is nice, but I had to work the crunch out with my fingers before I could get that effect. Also, it added virtually no wave or curl at all. It's probably good for women with thicker, curlier hair, but it's not ideal for my hair type.UPDATE: I've since used this as a supplemental product along with Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Curl Foam, which is my main styling product. The foam is intended as a second-day product, but my hair is so fine and given to frizz that I need an ultra light styling product, which is what the foam is. However, it's not quite enough to stop the frizz, which has been a struggle. So one day, I tried adding just a tiny, teensy amount of Cake--just a dab--by spreading it evenly on my hands and lightly spreading it around (after the foam), then drying it with a diffuser. It has worked great so far! It's also an excellent second-day product, but again, I have to use the smallest amount or else it gets all crunchy and stiff."
13,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not the real stuff - DISAPPOINTED,"I hate writing a bad review, but this is NOT what I buy in the store.  I use this product all of the time. The Cake products are my ""go to"" for my curls. as I LOVE the ""normal"" Cake products that I buy from Walgreens, although this is NOT it.  I bought this 2 months ago, but already had some, so I am just now opening it.  Absolutely disappointed and now I cannot return it (my fault for not immediately trying it).  The consistency is off, it is a lot thinner than what I buy at the store and made my hair greasy (as well as my daughters).  The smell is also not the same, somewhat close, but it's not the norm.I attached a photo.  Store bought product on LEFT, this purchase on RIGHT.  Right is almost Opaque.  Will not order it again.Sad. Reviews were good and maybe good for others that have not used the real stuff.  Buy the real deal. Hug fan and use it on a regular basis."
14,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,It smells fabulous and is very lightweight,"I am super excited that I found this product. It smells like a lemon cake and makes your hair smell so yummy.I have wavy/curly hair and it works perfectly on my do. It keeps the frizzies down and can be used in damp hair prior to blow drying or....it can be used on dry hair to give it a little bounce and hold.I never run out of my Cake Beauty Curl Friend cream. I make sure I have 2 bottles of it at all times.I love using it and I love the way it makes my hair look and smell.Its perfect for short-medium hair styles. It may even help if  you have straight and fine hair as well.It holds nicely and is not sticky at all.Bottom Line: Smells fantastic, not sticky, kills frizzies, can be used on both wet hair as a curl enhancer or on dry hair as a styling cream. Either way...you cannot go wrong. The price is really nice as well. It performs as well as the higher priced products but has the lower end price tag."
15,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent is unbearable,"I bought this item specifically for the scent - to be honest, I could have cared less if it left my hair less than amazing, as long as if it created a fun shower experience that smelled like cake. Unfortunately this did anything but, and I should have listened to the reviews that mentioned the bad smell. The full trifecta of products did leave my curls in fairly decent shape (I‚Äôll credit that to the argan oil that is included in the shampoo and conditioner), but the smell of the shampoo and conditioner combined creates a rather noxious olfactory experience that isn‚Äôt worth the mild benefits of the product. I am fairly sensitive to scent, and unfortunately the rather rancid bubblegum + cinnamon combination has made me throw this down the drain. Save your money if you have a sensitive nose."
16,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Your Curls Will Thank You,"I didn‚Äôt expect much from this product at first but was pleasantly surprised when I found a great way to cocktail this for my curls. For reference, I have 3C/4A curls and not many products can hydrate and give my hair what it needs. I learned that using this product as a styler didn‚Äôt do much, it left my hair frizzy but combining it with my favorite gel managed to give my hair shine and hold for days. This product hydrates my hair and works great when layered with a wash and go. Not as much tangles or fairy knots when using this styler before applying gel. Would recommend if you need a product that can function as a leave-in and styler when you need gel for hold."
17,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells so good it almost destroyed my diet,"I was looking for a curl creme since gels tend to be too much hold for my hair (3a, low porosity) and have read good things about this product line. The scent was reminiscent of a lemoncello cake from one of my favorite Italian restaurants and after being on a detox diet for a week, had me craving sweets hard... I used the creme by itself and it leaves bigger curls and my hair very soft, but I think if you like more definition you will want to pair it with another product that has a bit more hold."
18,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,This is amazing stuff! I'm 64 years old so I have tried a lot of product over the years. I have long hair that weighs down the curls/waves and all other product has either been to heavy or makes my hair crunchy. Not this - it leaves my hair shiny with beautiful soft curls and best part NO FRIZZ! I do tend to let me hair air dry as opposed to using a diffuser so I may have to update but as of right now I love it.
19,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really happy with it,"I have thin hair that has a very inconsistent wave pattern. When I allow it to air dry on it's own it will be inconsistent and frizzy. I added this stuff to the mix, as well as switching to a tshirt instead of a towel to dry my hair, and it's a game changer. It keeps the frizz away, while evening out my waves and adding body. Very happy with the purchase. Great if you're trying to lay off hot tools or dont have time."
20,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,HORRIBLE,"I was so excited to try this, I have thick curly hair and I wanted something to help my hair curl better. The second I opened it in the shower I was like this isn‚Äôt going to be good. It smelt so bad like just full of chemicals but I still gave it a try and boy do I regret it. I couldn‚Äôt even brush through my hair after it was just a snarled mess I had to go back in and put a different conditioner in it even to be able to brush it. Next day it just looked dry and disgusting. DO NOT RECOMMEND"
21,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Way too strong smelling, heavy on my hair","Now, I know I'm spoiled - I had a product that I'd used for years that's been discontinued, so I've been looking for other options.  This was recommended somewhere, so I thought I'd give it a try.First off, it is very strongly scented to me, and it's a super sweet smell - if ""cake"" is an indicator of the general scent family, they succeeded, but it's just too much.Second, I have fine hair that ranges from 2B - 3A on different parts of my head, and this was just too much for it. It simply doesn't work for my hair, no matter how little I used.  Granted, I didn't want to try too much because I found the scent unpleasant."
22,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thin, 3C, Low Porosity, Low Density Hairs","Pros:... Smells like frosting... LIGHT - my thin hair is not weighed down!... Keeps hair moisturized... Hair does NOT dry out the next day... Curls look great :)Cons:... Doesn't mix super well with other products (if you're mixing them before putting them on your hair; becomes a bit clumpy)LOVE THIS CURL CREAM!! This is now my holy grail product üíú I tried one that I saw that was consistently listed as a holy grail for 3C, by many different groups. It was awful & dried out my hair terribly.I kept seeing Cake brand in my local pharmacies, and had been wanting to try it. Very happy that I did! It smells like frosting, doesn't have glycerin in the first 3 ingredients (thank God), actually keeps my hairs moisturized even until the next day... I have zero complaints about this product. It's fantastic."
23,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,The one I reach for the most,"It seems to be the right one for my hair.  I have curly, wavy hair after having stick straight hair for 66 years, now I'm trying to figure out how to work with curly, wavy hair.  It helps the curls hold and also helps the wavy pieces blend in with the curly parts.  I honestly don't notice a scent at all.  I use a gel after applying the curl cream.  I would definitely recommend this curl cream."
24,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST PRODUCT EVER!,"So I will start by saying I have thick, course , dry, frizzy, semi-curly hair.  I have tried a lot of different products to try manager my frizzy unruly hair and nothing has worked until I bought this product. I used it in combination with the curl whip mouse.  I had to go to a funeral of a loved one and I new it was going to be a long day and half of the time was going to be spent outside in  87 degree heat and 82% humidity. I did my hair (I used my defuser after applying the products) and hoped for the best. My hair looked AMAZING!  My hair stayed in place all day and absolutely NO FIZZING!!  I am üíØ completely sold on Cake  products and will only buy this product from now on."
25,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not enough hold or lift for my 2B/C -3A waves/curls, but smells great!","This smells exactly like the Fresh Sugar lip balms you can get at Sephora. A light sweet lemon sugary smell. The cream is thick and tacky, but leaves the hair soft. It didn't give me enough hold or lift I was looking for. I have a mixed type 2B/C-3A waves/curls. My hair is very fine, but I have a lot of it. I need a bit of volume to keep my hair from hanging heavy and stretching out the wave/curl. It left my hair soft, shiny and had ZERO cast, but was too heavy for me."

JACKPOT. That shiz is important to me.This smells delicous! I'm still getting my curly girl routine down with this product. I usually put product in my hair when it is sopping wet but I've had the best success when putting my hair up in a microfiber towel for about 10 mins and then applying this.Cruelty-free, vegan, smells nice and my hair looks FABULOUS!"

28,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work,"My hair normally has ringlet curls.  Because of reviews I read, I decided to try a new product - Cake, Curl Friend.  While it may befriend others, it did not work for me.  1st use - my hair was frizzier than I have seen it in years.  I assumed I had not used enough product, so the next time I used more product- this resulted in frizzy ends, but the hair near the scalp was too heavy & weighed down to curl.  3rd try is charm, right?  No - next try just resulted in more frizz.  There will not be a 4th attempt."
29,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not recommended for humid climate,I live in a very humid place and had to use a lot of this product to control hair.

This product has a light consistency, which is nice, however, my hair looks and feels greasy and it feels heavier than usual. This cream also makes my scalp itch. Definitely returning."
32,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but tends to have inconsistent formulas","I've bought this twice now, and I've received different formulas both times. The first one was semi sticky, gel-ish cream, and held curls in place like a gel. If you added too much, it would be kind of crunchy. The formula of the cream I received last week is much more creamy. They've both worked for me completely fine, I just have to be careful how much product I use because it can make mely hair look greasy if used too heavy-handedly. The smell is wonderful, like vanilla and Froot Loops. The bottle is very big, and lasts a long while since a little goes a long way. My last bottle lasted me nearly 8 months of 3-4 times a week use after showering."
33,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good for fine wavy/ curly hair!,Light weight creme BUT effective!  The price is fantastic.  I reach for this over my more expensive creams more often.  Nice soft scent and does not remain noticeable.  I sometimes mix a tiny bit of conditioner together before applying and follow up with light amount of Biotera gel and diffuse usually.  I've tried the mousse as well but it seems to make my hair more dry.  I'll be sticking to this creme.  Love it.

I struggle to find something that will hold and define without being crispy or sticky. There are not enough stars for this stuff. It is the best stuff I have found in years. I received it Thursday used it Friday (today is Saturday) and I am ordering more to have on hand. This is literally the best defining cream around! LOVE IT!
35,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,It Smells Like Cotton Candy--Ugh,"This curl cream is very light. Frizz control--NO. Curls---YES. I don't care for the smell. Too sweet and sugary. Cream is very light. I had to put a second application because I wasn't getting any curl. Second application caused more frizz. I'm going to try the blow out as some reviews said that it was ""great""."
36,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing!!!!,"This stuff is life changing. In my fifties my hair got super course and kinky curley. Cake had transformed my hair. It keeps it soft, takes out the kink. Even my hairdresser comments on it every time I see her now. She has begun recommending cake to customers with similar hair. And it so inexpensive. I've spent hundreds of dollars on hair products and this is the best hands down."
37,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for curl Refreshing,"Light Scent. Creamy consistency. Product gives great bounce and manageability. If you love your curls to be soft, This is your product!!!!! I cannot give it the five stars because I am all about curl definition, and I didn‚Äôt get that using ONLY this product. I wouldn‚Äôt experiment with this for curl definition (just saying). Well my curly ladies see you on the next product (we‚Äôre always trying the next one, and it‚Äôs ok to love your hair) wear your curls big, bouncy,  proud, and smile‚Ä¶."
38,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally,This product is perfect for limp lifeless curls! It tightened them up with scrunching as it air dried and then all I had to do was run my fingers though it and I got what I was looking for! Very soft to the touch and the smell is like a hint of lemon cake üç∞ sooo good
39,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my 3A-B white girl curls,"This cream is wonderful! It has just enough weight to manage my volume, but it's light feeling, not as sticky or tough as some gels or mousse I have used in the past. This is my new go to styling product! I comb in while wet, set/style where I want the curls to lay, and walk away. And, if you are an evening shower gal, this has even worked to manage my curls overnight, so long as my hair was set and dry before I hit the pillow."
40,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite must have,"I have medium shoulder length hair. Very wavy to ringlets in some areas. By end of day, total frizz. Until I found this product! Now I can have ringlets for days. Actual curls. Nothing looks greasy or heavy. It‚Äôs soft and touchable, not frozen in space. Love it. An actual pea size x 2 is all it takes in damp hair.  Or to renew I add some moisturizer spray and then a pea size and work thru and scrunch"
41,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bomb curls!,My first time using. Absolutely love my results. My hair feels soft and I have great definition plus volume. Will definitely repurchase. I am 3a 3b curls. Also came packaged well.
42,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Jury is out,"I‚Äôve been using this upon recommendation from other curly haired women in a fb group. So far, I‚Äôm still giving it a try and I‚Äôm not certain how I feel about it yet. My wet hair feels course after I‚Äôve used it and like I haven‚Äôt quite washed it all out. After drying the curls look decent but crunchy-ish which can be scrunched out a bit. I‚Äôm still going to give it a good chance so I can fully assess how it performs."
43,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not.,"Not sure what kind of curls this is intending to help but definitely not mine. Just weighed down my curls, gave me no definition, and made my hair puffy and frizzy. I will say, however, it seems to work better when using a blow drying and defuser, so maybe it's just not meant for air drying curls. I just ended up throwing it out after many attempts of usage."
44,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like it.,"Smells good. It works good on my curls. I don't think this product would work good on 4C hair though (& yes, I'M a black woman lol). I was on a date, and after the date, dude said I smelled so good. Thing is... I didn't wear any perfume or scented lotion that day so this is what he was smelling. He said he usually doesn't get turned on by smells, but when he smelled me, this made it hard for him to control himself! Will be buying more products from the ""collection""."
45,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Soft defined curls, and amazing smell!","My 12 year old has mostly 3B curls, with some variation. Hers is fairly fine, but a LOT of it. This product is an amazing value. Smells fresh lemon cakey, is made in Canada, creates soft but defined curls. It feels clean, but coats hair well at the same time. Love love this product, and such a great price."
46,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Who doesn't love cake?,I have very curly hair and finding the right products is a never-ending task. I am so happy I stumbled across this line of products! My curls seriously never looked better and it smells super yummy too! The smell is very subtle so you don't smell like a sugar factory. I use the leave-in and then this and I am good to go. I've also used the shampoo and conditioner and the dry shampoo sheets. They sure did it right! Plus the price...I have paid 4x as much for stuff that doesn't even work!
47,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ingredients Don‚Äôt List Everything,"I scour all ingredients of products since I am allergic to avocado. Might seem like an odd allergy, but this ingredient is missing from listed ingredients. It only states higher on the back of bottle stating it is infused with avocado oil."
48,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,This curly girl noticed nothing!,"This smells so incredible, I love that aspect.However, as someone with very curly hair naturally that also gets frizzy as a fro at the drop of the rain...I could tell no difference and if anything my curls fell out and or would flip out at the bottom with zero style.. So disappointed in this!"
49,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected!,"I have medium-fine, mostly wavy, partially curly long hair. I purchased this product on a whim and was pleasantly surprised with how much I like it. It definitely helps define my curls and helps minimize frizz in the Florida humidity. The smell is pleasant and not too strong for my sensitive nose. Be careful not to apply too much because it can be heavy if you do. I will definitely purchase again"
50,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sickening sweet smell,"This product actually worked much better than I thought it would but ONLY on freshly washed hair. It did pretty much nothing when reapplied the second/third day. Also the smell is horrible. The sweet smell is sickening. And while it does fade once hair is dried, applying it to dry hair the next day amplifies the smell. For a little girl the smell is fine but I do not wish to smell like frosting so strongly that people across the room comment on it. This product has a lot of potential but I just can‚Äôt have the smell following me around all day."
51,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't care much for this product,I wanted to like this product because it has great reviews but it didn't really work for me. It makes my hair frizz up and doesn't help moisture my curls at all. But to each it own... it might help other gals!
52,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing product,"Was very excited to try this product on my curly hair... for starters it did not smell as good as I was expecting, scent was very light and almost imperceptible (which I guess is better than smelling too strong). Second it was very thick, not as light as the description made it sound. Too heavy for my hair type and my curls ended up being limp and flat looking all day. Not worth the $$"
53,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to like it‚Ä¶.,Curly haired people know‚Ä¶..it takes multiple products to look like it‚Äôs natural. Cake was highly recommended as a soft/no crunch curl helper. I find it to be a bit greasy/heavy but I‚Äôm very low porosity and about 75% gray. It may be it‚Äôs just not the product for my kids d of curls
54,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like a curl activator,"I can't say I am a huge fan of the other Cake products I have tried but I LOVE this curl cream.  I have very long, fine 2b and 2c hair.  I use this right out of the shower on soaking wet hair it works great as an curl cream/activator and on finer hair you really don't need much.  I got great definition and curls.  You can't beat the price.  Overall its a great product if you are looking for a good curl cream."
55,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my new favorite hair product. It smells delicious -- like lemon cake -- and it makes my natural 3A curls look great. It moisturizes but doesn't weigh my hair down. All I have to do is scrunch it in and go. It's not stiff or sticky; my hair is very touchable once it's dry. I will certainly buy this product again!
56,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty awesome,"This product is so amazing, I just tried it and its good, makes my hair feel soft and I have 3B type of curls.

57,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,My New Go-To!,"Okay so I gave this a 4 star simply for the fact that when I received it, it had gotten all over the packaging and whatnot(see pictures). I took it out of the plastic and it looked like someone had sliced it open with a box knife. HOWEVER, I simply ‚Äúbandaged the wound‚Äù and am still using the product.The product itself is 5 star! I absolutely have fallen in love with not only this curl cream, but the WHOLE LINE of Cake Beauty for my curly hair. The scent smells good and isn‚Äôt overbearing. I can tell a huge difference in my hair, it‚Äôs much softer, looks and feels healthier and full of life in my curls. Definitely would recommend!!!"
58,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't weigh curls down,"This set is probably the best curly hair shampoo set I've purchased on Amazon. It's very soft and emulsive, the conditioner is thick without being heavy and detangling is a snap. The curl cream has a great, slippery texture, a little goes a long way. It gives curls bounce and shine and isn't sticky or drying."
59,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like lemon cake!,Omg.

The product is not crunchy is a nice soft feel. I would recommend this for girls with 3b-3c hair types, also apply to wet hair and dry it with the diffuse for best results.  If you feel like its too sticky or hard you've applied too much"
61,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great styling and the smell is so yummy!,"This product is great for anyone wanting definition but not the crunchy feel of most creams.  And the smell is delicious.  I wish the anti frizz lasted longer, but it is average with all the others I have tried that were more expensive."
62,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay alternative to Sexy hair curl cream,"I‚Äôm a hair stylist so I frequently buy new products. Smells heavily like sugar, but I should of expected that - I just prefer a clean fresh scent. But the product feels heavy and sticky in my hair. Does it help clump curls? Yes. But I feel like by day 2 I want to wash my hair. I normally go 4-6 days."
63,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gives the best curls,This hair cream is the best for natural curly or wavy hair it makes your curls not frizz but it dose not make them crunchy it adds shine and makes your hair feel soft this is my go to hair cream and no other compare it has a nice cake like scent that fades after you put it on I highly recommend this cream
64,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Crunchy,"Better when mixed with an oil like argan, jojoba or grapeseed. I like a bouncy defined but above all soft curl. On it's own it gives a not so soft gel cast which I personally do not enjoy. If you like the crunchy gel look then this is good."
65,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Defining, shine and non greasy! Pretty awesome!",I tried this without any other product and on my damaged hair. It has a sweet Lemon pie scent. Super creamy. Make sure your hair is detangled and damp. It doesn‚Äôt leave a greasy residue and it keeps the shine. This is the day after! It worked! I‚Äôm waiting to try it together with the mousse and see if it lasts a bit longer!
66,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,"My daughter is multi racial like multi.

67,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,It adds more extra weight than I'd like.,It smells great maybe even lemon candy sweet.It works fairly well in my very fine medium curly hair but it adds alot more weight than I'd like it to forcing to use clarification and more FULL washes than other products I've had.
68,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,6th ingredient is rubbing alcohol,I wish I took a closer look at the ingredients before I used this. Isopropyl Alcohol is rather high up on the ingredient list and this stuff dried out my hair terribly. I definitely would caution against using this if you have high porosity or even slightly damaged hair. Two stars because it smells amazing.
69,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible residue feeling in my hair,"I wish this product worked for me because it smells amazing, kind of lemony. But unfortunately, my hair felt kind of greasy, kind of heavy, and it looked so dull. It took away all my shine."
70,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,More curls,Love this stuff‚Ä¶I just used it today & it brought back the curl from my perm I got in The summer
71,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"This stuff is a godsend. Use a generous amount of you have mid to coarse hair. Once it dries, fluff and you are good! I use this to air dry but would work well with diffuser also. I also use to refresh with a bit of water in my hand. No strong scent at all. Lovely formula. Will be buying for a while. Found through Ipsy!!"
72,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Frizzy and greasy,"I do not like this product. My hair is super frizzy and I can see the oil sitting on my hair strands. My hair is low porosity, fine, and I‚Äôm trying to find a lightweight product with curl definition and volume. This is not it."
73,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,I have thick wavy hair. I am able to wash it and put Cake in my hair and it dries amazingly! It is difficult to find something that doesn‚Äôt frizz or make it hard. I have tried many high end products. Cake is easy and smella great!
74,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells terrific, works great!","I love the scent, I love that it's bringing life to my curls!  I learned to use less at first, otherwise it does weigh down my hair.  That's not a flaw of the product; I was just using too much.  My curls are still bouncy and not crunchy."
75,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid if you have skin sensitivities,This product gave great curl definition but unfortunately I had to stop using it because I had a really bad skin reaction to my neck and forehead after using it. If you have sensitive skin be careful with this. It‚Äôs likely the citral additive which I didn‚Äôt notice in the ingredient list before I bought but if you have an allergy to citrus / orange additive this product might give you a reaction.
76,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for curls types under 4! Very heavy product.,"The lemon meringue scent is great, and it doesn't leave a visible cast. However, this is not good on my medium density, fine 3A hair type. It is far too heavy and weighs down my curls. This would be better suited for a thicker, coarser, tighter curl pattern (at least 4A, if not B or C)."
77,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best curls I've ever had,"This product is so amazing! It smells great (like actual icing on a cake) and feels great on my head/hair. It doesn't weigh down my curls or make my head feel grimy, like other products do. The first time I tried it, I didn't use enough, so I thought it didn't work. I used a bit more the second time around, and it worked great. If you've got thicker/longer hair, you'll have to cake some on (haha, pun intended)."
78,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Curly hairs BFF!,Everything is great about this curl cream.

80,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best curl products,I loved this. I have natural wavy to curly hair. This really defined my curls. I hadn't seen those curls since I was a kid. My family thought I had a perm done. I also combined it with their whipped mousse curl definer. My hair wasn't sticky or crunchy. It was soft curls. Definitely recommend.

I keep my hair short on the sides with a little bit of curls on the top, and this really softens them up and keeps them feeling light, curly, and moisturized.

85,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ehhh, I sent it back","I was hoping this would make my curls bouncy. This product left my curls 3b, tacky. My hair felt dirty no matter if I used a fine size or quarter size. I like hair products with a good scent.

86,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,No good.,"Product does not do what it says it's supposed to do.

However. within about 15 minutes,  I noticed allergy symptoms and realized the scent, while pleasant was causing problems.  So, back they went!(a 2 pk deal).

I like the consistency because it‚Äôs not too thick to where it weighs the hair down. It does have a nice smell. Other than that nothing unique stood out to me.
97,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great but did noting for my hair,I have coarse curly hair. This product did not provide any curl definition at all. It is probably  because of my type of hair; and it may work better on someone with less coarse hair??? Bummer because it smells good and is a good price.

344,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"love it, love it, love it","I originally got a little tube from ipsy and I fell in love with it when I tried it. Its absolutely good for my hair.  In fact, it didn't weigh my hair down and it wasn't sticky or heavy on my curls. I have super curly hair and being that it's long, The top would be flattened by the heaviness of the hair, but this help give it some volume until I get a chance to layer it again. Anyway my husband went and picked up the shampoo and conditioner plus the mousse and the cream. I'll update in a few weeks."
345,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best doe Afro hair,"I got a sample of this from Ipsy. As you can see, I have afro hair. I like the product because it smells good, but it isn't as thick as the products I am used to. The product moisturized my curls, but I needed to use a LOT on my hair."
346,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Liked it but something caused itchy reaction where hair touched my skin,"It took me almost a month to figure out why I was suddenly having problems with my neck itching. Not my face, not under my chin, but my neck, mostly on the sides.  I spent cycles of three days eliminating products - starting with the cleansers I was using, make up remover wipes, all my facial and lotion products, etc.... I ran out of my Cake defining curl cream and was using another product for approximately one week until I returned home. A couple days later suddenly I realized that my itching was back.I have long hair, apparently when I'm warm, Something about the product doesn't get along with me - and makes me feel like I'm breaking out in hives.  This isn't normal for me, I've never had this type of reaction before to any product.I wasn't surprised that it didn't make my scalp itchy because I only use it on the top layers and ends of my hair.I'm not sure what ingredient it might be, but it happened with the cream and then also the Cake whipped curl mousse."
347,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! This is a game changer. At a fantastic price,I bought another brand that was pretty expensive and everyone raved about how well it worked. I watched some YouTube reviews and ran across someone talking about cake products. My hair is curly/wavy. But the other product I purchased weighted my hair down. Cake did not and my hair doesn't look greasy! I'm impressed with the results since this is 1/2 the cost of the 1st brand I purchased. I will continue to use this product.
348,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous product!,"Did really well at defining my waves and curls. Not sticky or greasy? What the heck! A good product at a reasonable price. I apologize for not having a photo to show yet, but I hope to soon. I really loved all of the women that so wonderfully uploaded photos and results! Thank you, ladies. To the people that can't upload photos in the correct direction, I have this to say: ladies, thank you for being so generous and wanting to be helpful with your photos and results. It's heartwarming. Really.All of you had such amazingly beautiful hair, but I got SO frustrated that no matter how I turned my phone or tablet, I couldn't truly see clearly your gorgeous results! You all look amazing from what I can see, but only wish I could see the real effect the right direction. Thank you."
349,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for styling with blow dryer and straightener,"I love this stuff. I bought it because I wanted to let my curly hair air dry, however I ended up blow drying it and straightening it and let me tell you, my hair looked and felt AMAZING. The smell is amazing as well, like some yummy vanilla cake. I use it as a blow out cream to help make the styling process easier and combat my super fuzzy, frizzy curls. It does not make my hair sticky or greasy and it doesn‚Äôt weight the hair down at all. Sometimes products tend to make the hair feel dirty and greasy after a short amount of time and you end up washing your hair more often... not with this gem!"
350,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product but pricey,"I got a tiny bottle of this in my ipsy glam bag this month. I wasn't gonna use it on my hair, as I already have my routine/products that I never stray from.I decided to use this on my 4yo daughter's ringlets and it made her hair so so soft, more defined than her usual curl cream and FRIZZ FREE! Her hair was nice and shiny!I decided to try it on my hair when I was in a rush (I usually do a curl cream + gel for a cast then scrunch after it's dry) and it totally exceeded my expectations! My hair had volume, defined my curls, left it soft and really nice, similar to how it is after my usual routine. I'd absolutely purchase this, but the price is high for 6oz. I do love it though and it smells lovelyyy! I'll have to look elsewhere for a cheaper price."
351,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great for me,l have thick curly hair that gets frizzy and is very hard to tame. I have used numerous products through out my life (35).This product makes my curls defined and no frizz. I do think it can make my hair feel a little greasy if I use to much and I don‚Äôt love the smell but it makes my curls look great !
352,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was looking for,I have beautiful soft fine curls and wavy hair all natural and I thought wow a light weight product that‚Äôs not greasy or flaky to define my curls sounds like something I‚Äôd like to try. Well this is not it! It frizzed my hair- smells very light and decadent but apart from that no. It‚Äôs very light weight very ideal for no build up but no curl defining at all. The best way to describe this is as like a primer you place in your hair before applying the actual product that‚Äôs going to get the job done. I have 3a/3b hair with some tighter curls of 3c. Whatever that all means I have beautiful virgin hair and being mixed it‚Äôs almost impossible to find the right product. This is just a waste of time. Like a hair lotion. I hope this helps someone.
353,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,love love love!!!,"love!!! the smell is amazing. my hair is a little crazy, but this stuff tames it and emphasizes the curls better than anything I've found yet. I have a lot of hair so I use about half a palmful, but I apply it in sections to make sure I get all of them. I was using a product by Paul Mitchell (not entirely happy with it) before I discovered this -- I'm never going back!"
354,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes hair super soft and shiny!,"I'm not really informative when it comes to taking care of curly hair, but this stuff seems to do the trick. I like to add it when my hair is really wet, like when I just rinsed out my conditioner. These pictures that I attached are the result of shaking my head vigorously and this is how my curls came out. Before I shook my head, the curl were crunchy and hard. I don't know if that's what you're supposed to do when your hair dries, but it worked, and I figured that would be better than brushing it."
355,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my hair and smells amazing!,"I really liked this product, I first got a trial at Ispy and it works so well with my hair.  I have 2B curls/waves and have been trying to find something to keep my curls from flattening or becoming frizzy.  This works great for me and I love the scent, but it is very strong and sweet so that may be a problem for others.  It does hold my hair for awhile, but it does not last all day, however that is not a big problem for me and my hair still stays nice (just less curly).  But since it does not have that strong of a hold, I do not know if it would work for those with very curly hair. I used to straighten my hair all day every day and this product helps me embrace my curls and saves me a lot of time, I bought the two pack instantly.  Might even subscribe at some point."
356,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best cream for my 3B curls,"Awesome product! It leaves my hair soft and frizz-free, but my curls are defined and bouncy! I love the smell (a bit lemony) and the texture is nice and light. Not greasy or heavy. It's the only curl cream I've ever used that allows me to have day 3 and 4 hair! Definitely worth the purchase."
357,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,BUY ITüíñ,"I've struggled with curly hair all of my life,  the knots,  the cheek detanglers that smell like cleaning products. So much so that I would just put my hair in a bun and give up. But this stuff has changed my hair life. My curls are so bouncy and cute, so what I do now is detangle it and leave this product in and braid my hair while it dries and my curls come out so calm and manageable.  I was afraid it would be super heavy or really oily but it isn't and it smells AMAZING omg I couldn't recommend this product enough!"
358,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Breakage/ dry,First thing i got was the hair mask and because i loved it i went ahead and got the leave in. First 2 weeks was amazing after that i started noticing my hair frizz up and breaking so much. It sucks because the products were leaving my curls looking nice but once i took the product out it was super dry and it would break easily .
359,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair looks so great with this!,"Excellent!  Defines my 3b curls, isn‚Äôt stiff or sticky at all, makes my hair shiny and it smells like vanilla cake batter.  I bought it at Walgreens and I just got home with my third tube in two months."
360,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great at taming! A little goes a long way!,"Love this stuff! I have 2a-c hair and this works great both after washing and as a refresher. I work it in right after rinsing out my conditioner and throw some gel on top. In my experience, diffusing or air drying works great either way. In the mornings, when my hair is crazy from sleep, I wet my hair and work a tiny bit more in. For finer, less curly hair, it does have some build up so less is more with this!"
361,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Spectacular for my naturally curly hair!,The Curl Friend stying cream is wonderful for my naturally curly hair! It is my new ‚Äúfavorite product‚Äù! My hair is so soft and light yet controlled that my curls stay great throughout the day. I have even been able to not wash my hair every single day like I usually have to. I highly recommend this product!
362,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the curl cream- not shampoo & conditioner,"I've been using the Cake curl cream for a while now- I love it! Works very well on my frizzy wavy/curly hair, and defines it without making it crunchy. I received the set with the shampoo and conditioner as a Christmas gift, and I was super important to use it, but I'm quite disappointed. The smell is weird... kind of like crayons? And it makes me hair really frizzy and dried out. It's nothing special. Overall, highly recommend the curl cream, not a fan of the shampoo and conditioner."
363,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,wonderful.,I got a sample of this through Ipsy and fell in love.  It smells great...it moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy.  I have fine curly hair and this gives great definition and bounce.
364,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Defines Curls Without Weighing Them Down,"My previous curl cream was discontinued several years ago. I‚Äôve tried about 20 products since then and this is the best. I have medium thickness, non-course 3B curls and this cuts the frizz and defines the curls without weighing them down. I still need to use a bit of curly hair gel for a bit of hold too, but this is good stuff."
365,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hot Yoga and Motorcycle Hair,So I've been looking for something that can keep my hair super soft and healthy since I ride a motorcycle and my hair is exposed to high winds. I also do a lot of hot yoga and that used to nuke my hair as well. My hair is wavy and not so much curly and I have thick hair with thick follicles. I am so surprised how well this works. I put a bit in a small spray bottle with some water and its a quick spritz to keep hair healthy.
366,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loooove!,"I bought this from Walgreens yesterday.

I took off a star because it doesn't hold curls as well as I'd like it to - but it's still a great product and I recommend it to all, especially those with thicker hair that tends to curl on its own - this product just kind of keeps the curls together."

380,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy Grail,I am growing my hair out and embracing my natural texture. All growing up I thought I just had really poofy and frizzy mostly straight hair‚Ä¶ turns out my hair is a combo of 2b & 2c waves. I have been trying out various products for the past 6 months or so‚Ä¶ and I was so excited to try this when it arrived today! I used this on 2nd day hair after I dampened it‚Ä¶ and IM IN LOVE! My waves are soft‚Ä¶ not crunchy. It doesn‚Äôt weigh my waves down or make me greasy‚Ä¶ plus almost no frizz! Also it smells divine! Plus it‚Äôs vegan and cruelty free! Definitely going to be a regular repeat customer of this product :)
381,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must buy this product from curls,"This is the most amazing curl product I've ever had. It smells like lemon cake and I apply quarter size amount from top to bottom after I wash and brush through. I have thick, long, color treated hair with natural curl. I love that it keeps it from tangling and doesn't have the greasey texture of gel/pomade or the hardness of some mouses/hair sprays. Highly recommended!!!"
382,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair feels so soft and manageable,"I received the 1.49 oz size of this product in my ipsy bag a while back. I hoard my samples, so it took a while before I tried it. I absolutely LOVED it when I finally did. I loved the smell and it made my hair feel so soft. I immediately looked for the full size and added it to my cart! This product did not disappoint. It still made my hair feel super soft and manageable. The only difference I noticed is the scent isn‚Äôt exactly the same as the trial size. I did compare the packaging and they look the same, so I think it‚Äôs legit. Try it out! I have 3C hair and live in Vegas, so this is going to be a must buy for me from now on."
383,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Affordable, amazing curly hair product!","The scent of this stuff is amazing! Not overpowering at all, but definitely smells like a vanilla cupcake. Once my hair dries I can‚Äôt smell it at all unless it‚Äôs quite literally up against my nose, so if you‚Äôre scent sensitive this is a good option. I‚Äôve had the same bottle for a couple months now and I‚Äôm barely halfway through, so it‚Äôs good value for money. Holds my curls well, but keeps them soft and light at the same time! It‚Äôs perfect if you‚Äôre worried about products weighing your curls down, but also want hold and frizz protection. Highly recommend!"

385,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you‚Äôre looking for defined curls.......,"I had received a sample of this product in a FabFitFun box and was impressed from the first usage.I have thick, curly hair that needs help defining curls.

408,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,FINALLY!!!!,"It‚Äôs very difficult to find products perfect for my hair because everything makes it frizzy, oily, or weighs it down. I have 2c/3a fine curls with a good bit of frizz. But FINALLY!!! I found this on Amazon and searched to see if it was sold in stores near me and you can find it at Walgreens! Gave it a try after a wash last night and I have to say, I‚Äôm very impressed. The stretch is great, it doesn't dry with any heaviness and has to be crunched out a little once it starts drying. When it‚Äôs dry, it‚Äôs very light and brings out your natural curl. I section my hair in 4 sections and you need only a quarter size..a little goes a long way!! A touch up in the morning doesn‚Äôt take much product either! I didn‚Äôt have much faith at first cause I‚Äôve tried so many products but this is a perfect fit!!! It even smells great! Like yellow cake or a cabbage patch doll."

It‚Äôs the best curl product line I‚Äôve ever tried. It gives my curls a soft, defined, voluminous look. It smells amazing, looks amazing, it is amazing. The only bad thing I have to say is literally every shipment has leaked. Every single one. When it‚Äôs the conditioner that pops open, everything is a just a tad greasy. When it‚Äôs the shampoo, that‚Äôs a problem and I had to return it. Not enough of an issue to get me to stop buying the best curl product known to humanity. My daughter also uses this product and I included a picture of her curls before and after using Cake products. The left is after with NO STYLING. She just let it air dry. I wash my hair at night and apply the curl cream then in the morning spritz it with a little water and finger comb it. My daughter washes hers in the morning and lets it do it‚Äôs thing."

425,Cake Beauty Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream - Bounce Curly Hair Styling Product & Anti Frizz Control Heat Protectant for Hair Detangler ‚Äì Cruelty Free & Vegan,Flavor Name: Curl Friend Curl CreamUnit Count: 1,Verified Purchase,This product works great for both my mom and me. We both have very thick wavy/curly hair hers is about chin length and mine is very long and heavy.I love that it‚Äôs not a super heavy/stick product and leaves my hair very soft and not crispy. It‚Äôs also quite moisturizing which my very thirsty hair loves.I apply it while my hair is still very damp and I usually put some pure argan oil in first. I only use about and almond size amount (and I have a LOT of hair) and prefer to sprunch it in from the first ends rather that finger comb it through like the instructions say.I usually wash my hair every 4-5 days and it keeps the definition the entire time. Without it my hair usually goes frizzy after the 2nd day.The cream is also has a very light (not perfumery) sweet scented which is perfect for my mom due to a sever scent allergy. She has gone through DOZENS of products and wasted tons of money trying to find a product that doesn‚Äôt give her a migraine or hives and actually works well and this curl cream is the one!I also love that this product is Canadian made and cruelty free! Overall I love this product and will definitely be buying again.

I‚Äôve purchased many of them. I loved the smell of the hair mousse, hair lotion and hair sprays I‚Äôve purchased before. It really smelled like cake and I loved it however, this new smell is not one I‚Äôm pleased with. Kind of smells like a gingerbread scent and while I do enjoy gingerbread cookies during Xmas time it‚Äôs not a smell I want on my hair year round. I miss the old cake scent and I‚Äôm finding it difficult to find. I would not purchase this new gingerbread smelling hair product again unless it‚Äôs around Xmas season. As for the the results it had on my hair, I can‚Äôt say it really had any positive or negative effects. It really wasn‚Äôt all that great."

Like a mix of plywood and chemicals. I'm not sure if I can bring myself to actually use it, but if I do I'll update the review. The bottle is cute and it was well packaged, so there's that I guess..UPDATE: I ended up giving it a try, despite the scent, and I'm happy I did. As it lathers, the scent fades into a sort of faint bubblegum smell so it isn't so bad when being used- which was a relief lol. It also made my hair really smooth WHILE shampooing, whereas nearly every shampoo I've ever used tangles my hair. Changing my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars."

30,"Cake Beauty Curl Girl Next Door Argan Oil Shampoo for Curly Hair - Aloe Vera & Vegan Anti Frizz Curl Enhancing Hydrating Shampoo for Dry Damaged Hair - Sulfate Free, Paraben Free & Cruelty Free",2.0 out of 5 stars,Very strong scent,"I had high hopes for this but it really didn't seem to do much for my hair any more than herbal essence or aussie. While it doesn't smell bad per say, it is an almost sickingly sweet smell and the scent is very strong. To the point it set off my migranes. If my hair got damp after washing (like from rain) it would bring the scent back just as strong until my hair dried again. I even had to wash my pillow a few times to get the smell of it out. I have never had any trouble from other shampoo scents like I did with this one. I also started breaking out all around my scalp and the neck and my back where my hair sits against my skin within the first few uses. After I stopped using these products it started to clearup immediately. It might work good for someone who isn't sensitive to scents or has sensitive skin but if you do I'd skip it for sure."

However the overpowering scent of cinnamon was too much to the point of feeling nauseous. It didn't make my curls any curlier or smoother. Instead it made my hair super frizzy. The shampoo bottle came in a plastic bag and was opened (which might happen to any bottle). I threw this product away and sticking to my current one.

I have curly/wavy hair and the idea of a nice scent and a shampoo for curly hair at a reasonable price seemed too much to hope for. It was. The scent is very unpleasant - artificial and sort of like plastic. It really did nothing for my curls/frizz. I guess I am glad it didn't cost much.

0,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love This Product..,"Have never been a mousse fan. But this product is great on my fine 2A - 2B wavy, frizzy hair. It works  best when I wash and condition my hair. On soaking wet hair I put in a leave in conditioner, curl cream and this mousse. Plop my hair for about 15-20 minutes and let it air dry the rest of the way. So very soft, amazing smell, no frizz and defined loose curls. A very small amount of this goes a long way so I do not need much. Does not leave that crunchy shell either. Did try a couple of times using a diffuser but it left me with frizz and my curls were not as defined.  So for me, no diffuser. Note... I am a hair care junkie. If it is out there I have most likely tried it. This by far works best for me and is my absolute favorite."

I have VERY frizzy, unpredictable wavy/curly hair.This product is the first product I‚Äôve used that has controlled my frizz completely and has held my hair‚Äôs texture up for days at a time. AND I haven‚Äôt even used a diffuser after I use it, like it recommends on the product label. There is also no crunch.It adds so much shine and sheerness. I‚Äôve gotten multiple compliments. My boyfriend complimented my hair and thought I had done it. He was surprised it was all natural and all I had used was the mousse.I also only buy cruelty-free, vegan products so I‚Äôm really happy this brand checks those boxes.Mine was missing the cap when it came in, but it‚Äôs so good I still highly recommend!"
3,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,4.0 out of 5 stars,Thick product!,"I have medium thick Curly hair. This is way thicker than normal mousse so when you apply it to your hair it‚Äôs harder to spread all over . So first time I used this I used to much which left me crunchy , next wash I used it again only half the amount I would use with a normal mousse but after applying this I scrunched my hair with a clean towel to soak up some excess product which worked super well . Still firm but nothing like the first time . And then the next day my curls are still nice and they are soft to touch , not crunchy at all . My curls will stay nice for about 3 days they they get to tangled . The smell is fine not great it has hints of lemon in it .  I like that it‚Äôs vegan and cruelty free. Love the design and name of these products, I already bought more so I can try their other stuff !"

I have blonde, baby fine hair.  My hair is as straight as I am and has ZERO body.  When I TRY to add curls, as soon as I walk out the door my hair goes as limp as a man with erectile disfunction!!  My hair holds curl about as good as a Walmart bag holds my groceries....which is not very well.  I searched and searched for several weeks before I settled on trying the Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Mousse.  OMG I have found the Holy Grail of Mousse. I HAVE CURLS FOR DAYS!!  This stuff is soooo amazing that I will NEVER stop using it till the day I die.  It is whipped just like buttercream icing on a birthday cake and a little goes a VERY long way so you do not need much at all and my hair is almost to my waist.  Has a very light lemon scent which is fine because I use it for the curls not for the scent.  If you are on the fence about this BUY it now!!  If your hair is anything like mine, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!"

It‚Äôs a gift for Christmas for my sister in law and I can‚Äôt even order a new one with a cap and send this one back because this is not eligible for return. So stupid. So because there‚Äôs no cap, all the mousse will dry up and clog the top. Dumb.Edit - I ordered another one so that my sister in law could have a cap for hers since it is part of her Christmas present and I would just use the first one without the cap for myself... the 2nd one I ordered came with no cap as well! What kind of business sells mousse with no top? Do not show a picture of a pink cap when you are going to send it out without the cap! I‚Äôll never order from cake beauty again because of this."

I literally wanted to eat it :D  That being said, I did find the smell to dissipate after my hair dried, so if you're concerned about random people trying to lick your hair, no worries.  I'm one of those 2C curlies that are kinda stuck between too curly for most 2C products and too fine and wavy for most 3A products.  I was a die-hard DevaCurl user, but after the whole recent fiasco (thanks, thanks for ruining my hair after 4 years of loyal use while charging exorbitant prices...but I digress...) I had to replace EVERY. BLESSED. HAIR PRODUCT.  This was the last missing piece in my routine.  I'm in love!  I was finding all other curl creams to be too heavy.  By the end of the day, my curls would be flat and blah.  Not with this stuff.  I took this pic at the end of the day.  I still have all my curls!  NO FRIZZ!!!!!  This is a win.  ps - The products I now use are Shea Moisture Hibiscus shampoo & condish, Maui Moisture deep condish (once per month or so), CAKE CURL WHIP MOUSSE, Bioterra gel, Black Orchid diffuser, Aussie freeze hairspray as needed on days I need to tame the mane :)"

Hold could be stronger.","Maybe a 3.5? Blow drying with it in gives really great results, but that isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm looking for. I want to air dry. My fine, 2b hair can get a light hold with this when I let it air dry over some light moisture leave-in to help with frizz and it doesn‚Äôt weigh it down. It defines my waves, smells lovely, and the cast is easy to scrunch out to leave my hair soft. But it also doesn‚Äôt hold most of the waves if I step foot outside into anything less than perfect weather. It will also frizz up if I touch it at all while it‚Äôs air-drying. Maybe I haven‚Äôt found the right combo to work with this as I‚Äôm still learning what my waves need. I‚Äôve only just discovered them when I grew my hair out during lockdown. Haven‚Äôt had it long in years and apparently it wasn‚Äôt healthy enough to express itself way back then ha ha! üòä So this might be perfect for you and the price makes it worth trying. I will definitely keep using it when I use a hairdryer for special occasions."

Giving 4 stars just because I‚Äôm annoyed about it coming without a cap. It could have easily made a mess in the box and wasted product. On the questions someone asked the same thing so I‚Äôm not the only one. How do other products come without a cap but this one is just oddly missing one? I always used DemonCurl ultra defining gel and nothing really compares. This stuff holds well, my hair is super soft, no frizz, and it smells like cake. A win-win situation for me. Love it!! Now I just hope it does the same thing for me every time. Will update if this changes."
14,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh. Nothing special,"I love the Curl Friend cream so I thought replacing my normal mousse with this would be a slam dunk for my haircaire routine. Sadly, that was not the case.It's very hard to control the amount you dispense. It goes from nothing to OMG, my hand is fullll in an instant with no option in between. I have extremely thick hair a bit past my shoulders and it's way too much product for me. I can only imagine the overkill on ""normal"" hair.It feels like it weighs my hair down and makes it greasy without any hold or definition. I end up looking like I used a brush on my hair when it was dry. (I'm guessing that negative analogy may make sense to at least some of my curly compadres.)At the end of the day, I'm going back to my $3 drugstore brand (Suave Captivating Curls, in case you were wondering) which is the best I've found after trying literally 25 different brands on my quest for perfect curls."

It's amazing. Second, the product works great. It's a good medium hold. I got my curly hair cut short, and it works a lot better than gel. It doesn't weigh my hair down. The bottle says that there is no crunch, but I use enough at one time that there is a crunch, which I actually like. I think it protects my curls better in the diffusing process. When you scrunch out the crunch when it's dry, though, there's no residue."
16,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells great, watch how much you apply","I have naturally wavy hair but have been struggling to find product that helps to enhance the waves while also preventing frizz and providing some control. This product is a little stickier of a feel than other mousse type products are, and it does have a pretty sweet scent, although I personally like it. A little bit goes a long way. I learned my lesson upon first time use and applied too much which resulted in my hair feeling a bit weighed down and crunchy. Even using a small amount I noticed I can get a crunchy feel to my hair, so I took the suggestion of another reviewer and began to scrunch my hair with a microfiber towel after applying this product so the towel can absorb any excess, and I think it‚Äôs a little bit better since. Overall it does give my waves way more definition and control, and leaves my hair smelling nice."
17,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,VINE VOICE,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was very disappointed in this mousse it made my hair crunchy for a few hours after applying and my hair is now frizzy. I have very curly hair and only wash 1x a week except this week I will be washing again to use my other products which I believe work alot better at giving me flawless curls that last all week and are alot more inexpensive.  I will say the smell was pleasant at first but quickly faded. I hate writing a bad review but I also hate wasting money on a hair product I'll only use one time.
18,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unique texture,"The texture of this is unique. The pump releases a ton of foam with a light touch, but the product disappears into hair so easily. It takes some trial and error to figure out how much to use. But it works really well. Good hold and not too stiff, matte, or sticky. Does well in high humidity. Seems to help my hair dry a lot faster (but doesn't dry my hair out). It does make my hair texture feel a little rough, but mixing it with a little bit of leave-in conditioner before I apply creates the perfect whipped cream texture and makes my hair soft and shiny. I have thick, medium/fine wavy hair that gets both dry and greasy easily if I use the wrong products. This mousse has become my go-to. The smell is also great, like lemon cake. Not too sickly sweet or overpowering like some other Cake products."

This is amazing! It smells like a lemon meringue pie! The consistency is like a meringue too! It gave my curls a nice bit of bounce.My only complaint is that it it's almost impossible to not waste any. There's so much compression that a tiny dollop turns into a handful, and I felt like I had to discard half the amount of product each time.Overall though I'm very happy with Cake and have now purchased another of their products to try out. I use this for volume and a bit of definition."

My hair is between 2c-3a depending on how my hair is feeling. It smells like a cake lol, but flowery and pleasant. The consistency is nice and not weighted down. It's perfect and I can't believe for its price - very reasonable. I like it personally and easy to use."

And I don‚Äôt feel comfortable using the half bottle since it wasn‚Äôt sealed properly.I tried to request a replacement and was denied because this seller doesn‚Äôt accept returns. They need to accept them if the product is damaged. This is completely unacceptable. Would not recommend anyone buy this from this seller. Love the actual product though. It is light and leaves my hair shiny and has a decent amount of hold for just a mousse.

It's more suited for people that have thick hair and want something that is light weight which is definitely is. I want something to weigh my hair down and define it and this does not do that... The product is extremely decadent and rich and feel so great when you put it on.There is a cream version of this product which I find much better to weigh down thinner hair

Made my hair crispy, dry, super stiff and a very weird texture. I can tell this will wreak havoc on your hair with prolongued use. Didn‚Äôt help define my curls. It‚Äôs a cheap mousse, and it falls short amongst its cheap mousse counterparts. I was looking for a nice dupe for the Sebastian Professional creme mousse, but this failed miserably. The scent is the inky thing I liked. Smells like a dessert."

It‚Äôs SOOO luxurious!  After applying (always in sections), the texture of this foam seems to make my hair feel dry-ish?  But I when I add water and my Taliah Waajid Hold Me Down Gelle?  PERFECTION!!!  Everything comes together in the most moisturized and heavenly way.  My wash and goes last 5-6 days!!!  This foam is weird, but somehow anointed for my hair.  If it helps, here are my hair stats.  High/mid porosity, medium density, combination fine to coarse strands, 3b/c 4a curl pattern."
26,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall Good,"I bought this product because I've recently been trying to repair my hair that has suffered from extreme heat damage and has lots of split ends, after repairing it and bringing it to a reasonable state, I started to look into products that would bring the curls to life and help them keep their shape for longer periods of time. After using this for about 4/5 months, I can confidently say I love this product, It keeps its shape for as long as I need it to, and a little really does go a long way. I personally use it by glazing it over areas of my hair, then scrunching it up. One thing to note however for some is the scent, this Mousse does have a fairly strong scent, kind of lemony but still a fairly sweet scent, if you think it will be a problem, you're best looking for alternative Mousses. A good alternative haircare brand is Shea Moisture, I haven't personally used any of their hair Mousses, so I can't say I 100% recommend, but I do use some of their other products they do what I need them to do and it never lets me down. I hope this review was helpful and I hope you get what you need :)!Side Note: I see a lot of reviews saying they didn't receive the lid to this item, this personally wasn't an issue for me, but keep in mind when ordering!"

A little goes a long way. This worked pretty good for my hair type but leaves a sticky feeling. If you're like me and try not to wash your hair everyday I wouldnt recommend on your wash day as the next day it makes your curls feel sticky and weighed down. However, it does make my curls look as good if not a bit better than my regular goto brand. My curl type is 3A, high porosity, low density, fine width. What may not work the greatest for me, might work very well for you."
28,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff,"After trying several different products that lied when they said they were anti-frizz, I'm loving this stuff. Love the lightly fruity scent, love the texture. I usually put it on damp hair and then scrunch it by wearing it up under a bamboo hair towel for 15 - 30 minutes. I scrunch it some more after I take off the towel, let it dry, then loosen the curls a bit from the scalp with my fingers. Refresh the next day by getting hair damp and scrunching."
29,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I expected to love this product -- I adore Cake's Curl Friend cream. I have baby-fine 3A-3B curls, and when I tried this mousse it made my hair feel dry. I'm not saying it actually dried out my hair, but it just felt dry and stiff. I'll stick to Curl Friend from now on.For anyone whose hair isn't baby-fine, this might be a great choice. The mousse comes out really thick; a little goes a long way. The scent is wonderful -- to me, it smelled like lemon cake. If I didn't know better, I'd be tempted to eat it. :-)"
30,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"So I have super thin hair and slightly damaged due to box dying it red for 10 years. This product is very lightweight on my hair, keeps the frizz down and smells great. However, the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that it came with no top on it! So when i spray it in my hand, I have to whip the nozzle several times after so there is no extra product sticking out of it."
31,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not light weight and the smell is pretty strong,I'm pleased with this moose but a few things to know if you're unsure1. The smell is STRONG. It doesn't stay on your hair too strong but it does stay on your hands. If you don't like the smell of Cake's product you will not like this.2. Use it sparingly. It won't leave your hair stiff and crunchy like gel but it will leave it heavy (like if you put on too much leave in conditioner) if you use too much. It's also very sticky on your hands
32,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product & Cheap,"I have SO MANY HAIR PRODUCTS because im looking for ""the one"". I saw ""whip"" and just assumed it was a cute word for mousse. I used some on my hair and wrapped my hair turbin to allow some time for drying. When I took my turbin off and diffused my hair, I had the softest most natural looking curls. Not stiff like mousse is.Be careful when you dispense this. A small squeeze of the trigger and a whole lot of product comes out.Overall -im super happy with my new favorite product!"

Unfortunately, this mousse was extremely sticky and left what was almost a film coating on my hair shafts.  It smells delicious, but was way too sticky for me and also didn‚Äôt really prevent my hair from frizzing."
35,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great price worthy of trying,It does not smell like it said it actually smells like lemon furniture polish so I was disappointed buuuuttt it is very whipped which is what I was looking for and it doesn‚Äôt make my hair to crunchy so to speak and it does define my curls and a little goes along way just take not of that I tend to get too much in my hand. I will probably buy again because of price not the smell it doesn‚Äôt smell bad it‚Äôs just not what it says it smell like in description.
36,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sticky icky,I thought I‚Äôd try something new and was hoping this product wouldn‚Äôt leave my hair sticky but it did. :/ I did try it for a week and a half to ensure that it wasn‚Äôt just a first time fluke. I can‚Äôt speak for the smell because I am not able to smell. I have wavy hair and using a product makes my very busy life a little more doable.  I went back to my only trusting product:  OGX coconut curls

It dried out my hair, making it feel like straw, and also dried my scalp making it very itchy. I didn‚Äôt mind the cake like scent, but my husband did. My curl type is 2c-3a, high porosity. I tried mixing it with my regular gel, but still didn‚Äôt work. The itch was more than I could take, so not trying it again."

Canister doesn‚Äôt even feel 100% full. And the best part is that I went though the process to ask for a replacement and it says it can‚Äôt be replaced or refunded!?!? WTF. So you ship me a broken product and don‚Äôt stand by my order. I‚Äôm just supposed to eat the cost of an unusable can of mousse."

I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt realize that it was going to smell like actual cake. I thought that was just a brand name. I want to eat it. A lot.But I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about the actual product performance. Maybe I‚Äôm using it wrong. But it‚Äôs not really doing it for me. It mostly just makes my hair crunchy (and tasty smelling). I thought mousses had evolved beyond the crunchy hair trend. Oh well

I'm almost tempted to eat it. However with my (max) 5"" hair, I find myself wasting a lot of product with just a quick pump of foam because a little really goes a long way. But overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase and will buy more once I finish this :)"
42,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE VEST PRODUCT EVER!!!,"I have thick, course, frizzy, semi-curly hair. I have tried a lot of different products on my hair and none of them could control my frizzy unruly hair. I used this product in combination with the Cake defining curl cream and used my defuser to do my hair. My hair looked amazing and did not frizz at all in 87 degree heat and 82% humidity. I am amazed by this product and I'm completely sold on it üíØ. I will never use another product on my hair again."
43,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to like it,"I really wanted to like this one, but it turned out meh. My fine hair is easily weighed down and needs a strong hold, and this stretched out my curls or turned them into flat squiggles. The smell is good and the foam was super thick and luxuriant, but the hold and the results just weren't the best. I'm sitting here on day 3 with poofy, frizzy hair. It did make my hair super soft though, and the clumps were decent. I think if you're after performance and longevity, you need Not Your Mothers or a strong casting gel. I might experiment with it more and edit my review if I can get it work, but to be honest, NYMs is just the better performer. A shame - I'd prefer to support a smaller brand."

I apply it after I get out of the shower at night, along with my usual oils. I have extremely frizzy dry hair from previously bleaching it and then dying it back dark brown.

Smell was good and it worked. I liked it. However, I received a new shipment and it burned my scalp. Like hell fire! I literally ran home and washed my hair and had to put coconut oil over my head. Day two and my scalp is still very sensitive. I‚Äôve noticed hair loss the last few months as well and I think it might be related to the use of this product. Do not use!"

It barely helped my naturally curly hair. Was hoping it would defrizz it a bit. Can‚Äôt return it and I made the mistake of buying the two pack. Feels sticky. Makes my hair snarly.

It was very heavy and weighed boy hair down. It left it crunchy - like when we were in middle school and scrunched our hair and straightened our bangs to our faces. That type of crunch. It did make my hair curl up very nicely - leading me to believe it would be good in thicker hair types. I gave it to my friend with thick curly hair, hopefully it works for her!"

I put it in my hair when it's still very wet, scrunch it with my hands and then I dont touch my hair at all till its totally dry.

This mousse was very heavy and sticky. The can comes with no top, so the mousse dries in the tip and it‚Äôs hard to get it out.

While it‚Äôs not stick straight, it‚Äôs so fine and completely devoid of texture that I can‚Äôt even get it to hold in a scrunchy. I bought this with the hope that it would give me the texture of a sea salt spray without the stickiness and it does exactly that. So while I can‚Äôt speak to how well it helps define curls, it definitely gives me the body and texture that I was looking for."

I have a pixie cut and i only need the tiniest squirt of product."

For the past year, I've been air drying my hair and wanted a mousse that would assist in keeping the curl.  This is the product!  I put it on my towel dried hair (flip my head upside down and add the foam from the root to the end).  It does at first have a somewhat sticky feel to your hands, but then it just disappears.  My hair is never crunchy, and the next day when I comb through my hair, it has more volume than if I didn't use this product."

However, this smells straight up like sweets. Which, of course I got from the name but it is overwhelming. I ended up with a migraine when I put it on. Not only that, it feels like it's drying and damaging my hair. It's like the mousse absorbs all the water. The results do look amazing but when I wash it off, my hair ends up super dry and tangled. Definitely wouldn't buy it again. Even though the results were great, nothing is worth getting a migraine over."

It does leave some crunch, but really develops your curls. It does not control frizz, use some hair spray for that after. Lightweight and moisturizing, not thick or sticky."

The product goes a long way. I‚Äôve had this mousse almost four months. My hair is very fine, thin 2b-3a wavy/curly. I only used a bouncy ball or two sized amount. It doesn‚Äôt weigh my hair down at all. I can just use the mousse for a soft curly look when dry or add it in with my leave in and a little gel to get a nice cast. Once I SOTC, it looks great!"

It seems like this is a common enough issue and the company should correct. Believe me, I am all about saving plastic!!

It‚Äôs not a showstopper, so I probably won‚Äôt be purchasing it again. As soon as I apply it to wet hair it does make my hair feel like straw. But, once everything‚Äòs dry, my dried curls are touchably soft. The smell is great, and I think it‚Äôs priced right. it‚Äôs not a bad mousse , but I think I can live without it for now. Maybe I‚Äôll circle back to it in the future."

Gives me bouncy, lightweight and defined curls paired with a cream and a gel. A little also goes a long way so I believe this product will last me for a decent amount of time.

323,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,4.0 out of 5 stars,Why Did I have to Love This,"I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars ONLY for the fact that I had to use ALOT of product to rack it through my curls. (4a/3c natural kinky curly hair).I love the foam texture but it order to saturate my hair so I can rack my fingers through it, I had to use a lot of products.Other than that‚Ä¶. The pics are second day hair of my wash in go. The smells is amazing and I‚Äôm able to not use a foam mousse and gel‚Ä¶ the mousse has the hold of gel.I have amazing hold, no flaking thus far, nice definition‚Ä¶. My only issue would be‚Ä¶ using 1/2-3/4 of the can per wash day. With those harsh ingredients eliminated from this product‚Ä¶ I should be able to wash this out w/ a creamy cleanser.I also used a curl finishing spray from Amazon."
324,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,Even works in high humidity,"I usually avoided mousses like this because they don‚Äôt have enough hold and fail in humidity. If I used a mousse in humid weather, I‚Äôd have to wash again the next day and use a stronger hold product. Then I found this and it holds all day in humid weather and even allows me to go 2-3 days before I have to wash and reset. And it does that without weighing my hair down. It has a nice vanilla scent that doesn‚Äôt trigger my asthma or allergies and doesn‚Äôt leave me feeling like I‚Äôm smelling cookies all day.The one thing I don‚Äôt like about this product is the cap. It‚Äôs often difficult to find a can of this mousse with the cap still on at the stores. Like, ONLY this mousse will be missing the cap near every time I see it in stores. They need to work on that."

There are a lot of good reviews so I thought I would try it. I have natural loose curls‚Ä¶ however, I must use a mousse  product to enhance them.My ‚Äúgo to‚Äù product is very creamy and conditioning when applied‚Ä¶. This mousse was very sticky and I could not run my hand through my hair when applying. I had to use a pick to apply throughout.(I never comb or brush my hair. I only use a pick when fully dry to fluff a little).I continued my routine after applying cake‚Ä¶. A little scrunch - a little blow dryer- a little air dry‚Ä¶.and repeat..My finished ‚Äúlook‚Äù was a bit sticky and flat.I was hoping for nice crispy curls.Maybe I used too much‚Ä¶. I will try it again ( since it is non refundable) but this time I will use leave in conditioner first and less ‚ÄúCake‚Äù.What I did like about the product was the name of it and the packaging. It was very eye catching. It must be working for a whole lotta users out there- hence the positive reviews‚Ä¶.Everyone‚Äôs hair is different and my technique may be different than someone else‚Äôs.  I will use again and update this review with any changes in the outcome."
336,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not really impressed at first **updated**,***edit***I switched over to a cowash and after that I had an easier time with this product. It took some time to figure out the right amount to use but I like it better now. I did find it‚Äôs a lot cheaper at Walgreens though.I spent more than I normally do to try this and I‚Äôm kind of sorry I did. I don‚Äôt like it very much. It makes my hair crunchy no matter how little I use and it leaves it with a weird texture. I don‚Äôt shampoo my hair often and that hasn‚Äôt been a problem with other products I‚Äôve tried. I spray it with water and scrunch and go but this makes my hair have a really odd texture I cannot work with. It‚Äôs almost sticky and my hair looks really bad. I wish I loved it but I‚Äôll continue my search for the miracle hair product I‚Äôm hoping for.

It tends to friz. What I need most in a product is something light weight that doesnt hold down the curls, while having enough hold to define them and also combat friz. This does this. It smells nice, a very light scent. A little goes a long way."

First of all, the scent is amazing! A little goes a long way too! I had tried just a curl cream to start, but my waves always fell out midway through the day. With this mousse I had better definition and my curls stayed throughout the day!I usually apply while my hair is damp, allow the curls to set (it looks a bit crunchy at this point), then I scrunch out the crunch once my hair is dry. I get a good amount of volume too! The only downside is it does make my hair a little ‚Äústicky‚Äù if I try to brush it at the end of the day. If I start brushing at the ends and work my way up it‚Äôs not a big deal though. Overall, I am really happy with this mousse and would buy again!"

364,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,I've used this product a few times now. I reread what other people said and used less. I tried using it on very saturated hair. I can't stand how it dries so quickly. When I try to fix some of my curls they just turned a frizz and lock it in.
365,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,5.0 out of 5 stars,Oh my goodness üòç,"Short review-Pros:-Low price-Smells incredible-Is the magic potion for curls-Adds shine and body-Holds together curls that would otherwise turn into a limp and stringy mess-Makes my hair look HEALTHY-Doesn't weigh down or make hair look dirty if you use a lot...and I used a LOT.-Potentially manifests all of your hopes and dreamsCons:-Makes your hair feel rough and dry when you're working in the mousse but this is barely a con because having wet mousse-y hair is not the thing we are accomplishing hereOkay, to start off I sort of neglected my curls for a couple of years. Recently I have been finding my way back to my natural curls, and I've tried so many products.I bought this mousse on a whim last night at a pharmacy and OH WOW HONEY!!Incredible results in my first use! My hair hasn't looked this defined and shiny maybe EVER. This is quite possibly my holy grail product now.I conditioned, rinsed, then combed my hair upside down and scrunched in a huge handful of mousse (seriously, a huge handful. It looked like way too much) and applied and combed it in thoroughly roots to ends.Then flipped my hair up, and made 3 sections bottom to top (I work in layers) and used my denman brush (7 rows) to form curl clumps in each layer.Then very gently scrunched water out of my hair with a cotton Tshirt, then scrunched more mousse in the ends, and scrunched again.Then I diffused my hair, something that has always failed dramatically in the past. No mousse or curl cream in the past has ever worked for me and normally my curls turned into a giant frizzy halo, but this time NO FRIZZ AT ALL!This is literally the first time in YEARS that my hair has looked this SHINY, bouncy, and HEALTHY. My curls actually stayed the exact same size, shape, and texture from the moment my hair was finished being styled until after it was dry and I fluffed it out. Yes, it looks so healthy and lightweight I am just blown away!Only ""complaint"" (not really a complaint at all, I don't consider this a real bad thing) is that this mousse on wet hair gives it almost a scratchy, dry texture, so be careful with your comb or brush because it can form tangles.But once your hair is dry it will literally be so defined, shiny, and beautiful.One thing I LOVE about this mousse is as they state, there is ZERO crunchy texture or oily or stringy or weighted look when it dries. My hair looks exactly like how I've been dreaming for it to look for years.And to add to it, this mousse smells like cupcakes and is the most amazing thing I get to smell all day.I'm in love with Cake products and I've already sent screenshots of this one to like 8 people. Definitely now a customer for life"

I couldn't smell it in my hair though...which could be due to the other products I use. This offers a like hold, similar to other mousse products I've tried since starting CGM. I personally prefer a strong cast on my curls which this didn't offer. However this will be something I keep handy for day when I'm outside or at the pool."

Although it does work pretty good, it's SUPER STICKY and if my hair is too wet when applying it makes my hair stiffer than I like.

374,Cake Beauty Curl Whipped Curl Defining & Volumizing Mousse ‚Äì Aloe Vera & Vitamin E for Flexible Hold - Vegan No Heat Curls Mousse for Wavy & Curly Hair - Sulfate & Cruelty Free Hair Products For Women,Size: 8.4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Edit: I've used this for about a week, it's honestly the best mousse I've ever used. I'm really happy I found this product. It seems expensive but you only need about one handful each use, so it works out similarly compared to cheaper mousse options.Original review:I've only just used the product and right after I rushed to write a review because this stuff smells INCREDIBLE. The smell is similar to lemon cakes or lemon merengue. I was worried it would be sickly as I usually hate scented stuff but in this case, it is a subtle smell that fades eventually. I had to resist licking it off my hands honestly. (This mousse is of course NOT edible, it's for your hair, don't lick it.)A little goes a long way, I really didn't need more than a handful for my whole head (which isn't the case with my other cheaper mousse). I'll have to update with how it holds after a few more uses. I have 2a/2b waves that drop quickly when dry as they are somewhat damaged from bleaching so I need all the help I can get.Important to note: I bought this directly from Amazon and the order was also fulfilled by Amazon. The product arrived with cap intact and seems authentic. Maybe I got lucky but make sure you buy from Amazon only as resellers can't be guaranteed, like the pic says."

I just got a quarantine haircut from my bf and decided to try and embrace the curly life for a while but I didn't want to buy several products ad dive into a long hair routine.It's also worth adding I have lots of hair but it's quite fine and my air-dried hair is quite frizzy, wavy with straight bits on the back.Because my hair is fine any creams and gels just weigh it right down and ruin any curls I could have.After reading the reviews I decided to give this mouse a try! And it did not disappoint!Texture:The mouse is quite deceiving. It looks quite soft and airy but it's actually very dense so a little bit goes a long way! For my middle length hair, I only need about one handful. It glides on your hair beautifully without leaving it feeling heavy or sticky.Results:I have never seen curls like this on my head! We are talking perfect ringlets! I still had a little bit of frizz but let's be honest I am lazy and don't put much effort into this.The end result was smooth, curly hair that smells like a lemon cake!I will also say that the hair stays silky and hydrated for days. I noticed that when brushing my hair before a wash I had no problems with tangles and my hair was so soft to touch I run to my bf to make him touch it!This is a perfect product for anyone looking for an all-in-1 product that deliveres!"

It is lightly scented with a lemon scent, that fades away quickly. It has a feel to it unlike any other mousse I have tried and my curls love it. I still add some gel for hold, but I can get about three days before I need to wash again. My only complaint is how Amazon packaged it. It was in a large box, no bubble wrap , just rolling around and the lid had come off. Luckily no product had come out, but certainly not the best way to send this product."

0,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake,This product is fake. The actual Cake ‚ÄòDo Gooder is my favorite dry shampoo ever. I also have the Wave Maker and noticed some discrepancies between the designs on the bottles. I did a little research and yep- the dry shampoo is totally fake. I had a suspicion because the product does not smell as good as the original and has a sticky rather than dry finish. Buyer beware.
1,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,I am a dear creature of habit so I have always used Not Your Mother's dry shampoo. That was until I recently saw a video by Brad Mando who was testing different brands of dry shampoo and I realized I been using the wrong products!So Not Your Mother's always leaves the white cast while this product does not! I love it! I recently dyed my hair purple and I can't wash my hair as often so this bad boy is my new best friend and looks like I am in love. Highly recommend.
2,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great! Wasn't the best match for me.,"Smells just like a cupcake! I spray it on for the scent alone. I really like how fine the mist is, even though this little can puts out a lot of product at a time! But, in terms of it's intended use, Dove dry shampoo does a better job for me. This makes my hair stiff (even if it's just been washed), almost like a super mild hair spray. And, in terms of helping with the appearance of shine/greasiness, it helps for about a half a day. By the time I get home at the end of the day my hair doesn't look great. I was excited about the reviews, and for some people it really works, but for my wavy/curly, long, fine hair, it's not the best fit. Maybe it's too heavy? Worth a try though! If nothing else you'll smell like a cupcake for a day!"
3,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this after watching a Brad Mondo video in which he tests different dry shampoos. One that he tried was Not Your Mother's, which I had previously tried, and came to the same opinion as me...it left a white sheen no matter how far I sprayed away from my head. So when he mentioned this one and the smell was so much better and no white residue. Had me sold. So I ordered this and couldn't wait to try it. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. It literally reminded me exactly of Not Your Mother's...even the smell. The NYM brand has a tapioca base, so it has a sweet tapioca type smell...I could be wrong, but to me the Cake version smells similar when it was mentioned that it smells like...cake. I sprayed from a distance and I had so much white residue I had to wash my hair immediately because it was so noticeable even after working it in. I was so hopeful, but it did not deliver. Now I did see some reviewers mention that they might be fake...maybe that is the case, but needless to say, I won't buy again to compare."
4,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete disappointment,"Surprised by this dry shampoo, it seems as though the product doesn‚Äôt have the typical powder or drying product that soaks up the oils from the roots as you would want.  It just goes on like canned air with a unpleasant scent that smelled nothing like cake. I‚Äôve used Cake products before, and this one just didn‚Äôt perform like normal.... I was completely disappointed and unfortunately there is no return possible so I‚Äôm just out the money."
5,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, just not enough for my wallet","I think this product is great, unfortunately there's just not enough in it for me to buy again. It's a little pricey for the amount that you get I only get 3 to 4 uses out of this, which is unfortunate because I do like the product a lot. But I'm going to stick with old faithful because it's a bigger bottle and it's about $2 cheaper. It's not as good as this product but It works as intended and it a better bang for my buck."
6,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not like I remember it to be...,"I  used to use this dry shampoo all the time and I would constantly get compliments on the scent, People would always ask me what I was wearing. I switched to another brand one day when I couldn‚Äôt find cake at the store, but decided to re-order it because I used to love it so much. But I have to say this smells absolutely nothing like the cake dry shampoo that I used to use and this leaves a heavy white cast in my hair. I will not be re-purchasing, and I‚Äôm probably going to give this away."
7,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as pictured, doesn't work well","I kind of suspect this is a fake, or something? I purchased both this and the dry conditioner. They are different sizes and shapes, and both labels look fake and printed on. Not like other Cake products I have purchased before. For example, the ""cake"" logo itself has a different background color - looks like someone made a really cheap mock up and printed it onto a different, crappy product.Strong smell at first that fades immediately. And does NOT work. Doesn't really clean at all, leaves my hair feeling heavy, limp, and just plain gross and dirty!!"
8,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful product; fragrance is unbearable,"I have lighter blonde hair. Even with continued brushing I couldn't get the powder to brush out. And the smell! UGH! It made me nauseous - sickeningly, overpoweringly sweet. This company had a *great* product once - Cake Beauty the All Powderful Tinted Dry Shampoo Powder, Light - 1.7 oz - but it's no longer available. This aerosol is no substitute for that product, and of course it can't be returned. I do not recommend this product."
9,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",2.0 out of 5 stars,Overpowering scent.,"The smell of this is so overpowering, it gives me an instant headache. It smells like a 14 year old getting ready for prom. The first time I used this I had to drive to work with the windows rolled down. As far as this dry shampoo doing its job, it is just okay. My hair started to look oily after about 5 hours of applying."
10,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not ‚ÄúAll Natural‚Äù,"So much for ‚Äúall natural‚Äù what‚Äôs natural about spraying three kinds of gas and aluminum onto your scalp. I‚Äôm so disappointed, will never use this and CAN‚ÄôT EVEN RETURN IT! Total scam! The ACTUAL ingredients aren‚Äôt listed anywhere on page, just the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù. Waste of money and space. I‚Äôm so mad."
11,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,Does NOTHING and non refundable! Do Not Order!!,"I don't know how this product has so many good reviews. It does NOTHING and, if anything, leaves your hair greasy. I'm appalled that Amazon offers this as a ""prime"" item, but does not allow you to return it. I wish i would have read the bad reviews before ordering it."
12,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not great,"I bought this because of the frequent remarks about the scent. It does have a better scent than other products I've tried. However, even at the correct distance, the product leaves noticeable white on my blonde hair, and it's also a little heavy for my fine hair. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with darker hair because of the white powder color it leaves. Not for me, but for the price it was nice."
13,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",2.0 out of 5 stars,Cake dry shampoo,"Threw fragrance in this dry shampoo did not smell pleasant to me.  It's a chemical,  fruity smell.  It also left a significant white residue in my hair after working product into my roots.  And really,  a cheaper option of Dove or Batiste dry shampoo seem to work better than this product"
14,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,I had high hopes..,I was looking for a good new dry shampoo product and this left my hair even more greasy and to boot it lasted all of 8 times. I have very fine hair and an oily disposition and it didn‚Äôt fulfill anything‚Ä¶ Smells fantastic‚Ä¶ no residue‚Ä¶ but does nothing but make your hair more oily and NO volume whatsoever. I will not buy this again. It was very disappointing to say the least. At most I had super greasy hair and it smelt like ‚Äúcake.‚Äù üòí
15,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Product,"I am just in love with the Cake line of products! They are lightweight and this one smells like vanilla frosting. It does not come out heavy or powdery like some other dry shampoos I have used before. I have ordered this product a couple times now. I will keep on doing so, I just love it."
16,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product highly recommended,Love this dry shampoo! The scent is fabulous does not leave white residue and does not geelGreasy or drying it is perfect! And the scent smells like baked cookies!!!
17,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works really well just don‚Äôt like the strong scent,I don‚Äôt like the scent but it works really well at making my hair look amazing. I‚Äôm just not a fan of the strong scent. It does kinda smell like almonds after a while
18,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",2.0 out of 5 stars,Buy something else...,This product smells great but does not work effectively as a dry shampoo. Hair still looks greasy after using.
19,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best dry shampoo!,"This dry shampoo has a wonderful scent, like baked sugar cookies. I found out about this product thru a friend of mine and I‚Äôve been using it ever since. It‚Äôs not heavy on the hair, works well and the scent is very pleasing."
20,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells so good, never stiff!",I have been using this on my fine hair for a while and I love it!  Gives volume that I desperately need but never too firm. Used in conjunction with Cake hair spray. Love it!
21,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",4.0 out of 5 stars,Brad Mondo Recommend!,"I saw this on a Brad Mondo video so I had to try it! Overall it is okay, the smell is just not as pleasant as some others and I have blond hair but could see the powder in my hair. Overall though, a very good product."
22,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,No white cast!,"This stuff is great! Smells good, adds great volume, and most importantly doesn't leave that awful white cast on your hair like some dry shampoos do! Love cake products!"
23,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried to like it, but...","...this stuff smells bad. There is a faint bit of spice cake scent, and I tried it a few more times thinking it was just me. Nope, it just doesn't smell good. It also doesn't work that well. Disappointed. Going back to Dove."
24,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,The smell is unbearable,"I usually don't mind strongly scented dry shampoos. This one made no difference on the oily look of my hair, but it did make me stink all day like sickly sweet cake vomit :( I can't return it because it's an aerosol can."
25,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute favorite,I will never willingly buy any other dry shampoo. This is the best on the market. Very little to no residue. And you smell like cupcakes. Yes please.
26,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing dry shampoo,"I love love love this product. I did one small spritz on each side of my head and it was perfect. I brushed it through and there is no white cast. It makes my hair smell nice, look nice, and I don't even feel any knots in my hair. And knots are usually a big problem for me."
27,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not my favorite,It's great at adding volume to my hair but does leave a white residue and doesn't smell too great. It does the job I just spray and wait longer to brush out my hair so I can be sure it's dry.
28,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok but smells awful,"Was this dry shampoo all that I wanted it to be,  after seeing high praises online, NO.  It's just ok dry shampoo. The volume wasn't all that killer.  The smell totally puts me off.  Usually I'm ok with smells but this one does not take the ""cake""."
29,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst dry shampoo I have ever purchased.,This prodcut not only underperformed when it came to freshening up your hair it also ran out after 5 uses. I have never been so dissappointed in a dry shampoo.
30,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,great product for the price,"I am a faithful user of a product that runs $25 and frankly I was tired of paying such a price. This is a great alternative for me and my pocketbook.  Clean scent, hair feels very clean and silky after use.  I would recommend this product."
31,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best,"This doesn't really do anything. It has a white cast. Doesn't get rid of oils, the smell is okay I guess. Nothing to die for. I read reviews after I purchased it that this is probably fake. I'm gonna order off the cake website and compare."
32,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Smells good and does what it is supposed to do!  Don‚Äôt overload it or you‚Äôll get white residue on you combs and fingers.  I couldn‚Äôt see it in my hair but it was all over my fingers and comb.  I used way to much though.
33,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,ZERO Residue!!,Great scent and NO residue! The first I‚Äôve ever tried that leaves my hair fluffy and lightweight. I use it every day along my hairline to prevent sweating on Summer days as well. Works great!
34,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great,"Very impressed with the no white residue. I have very dark hair, and the first time I tried it I wasn‚Äôt happy because it did leave a white residue. But for some reason every time since I haven‚Äôt had that problem. Also it smells amazing getting whiffs of it through the day."
35,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,Nasty!,"Very disappointed... This showed up looking like someone had used this product, left in their shower, then returned.  AWFUL, gross....Never should have left their establishment!  Used product!!"

52,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,This doesn‚Äôt seem to be a dry shampoo at all...,"This product is not worth the price because it simply doesn‚Äôt work.  Instead of leaving hair refreshed, like dry shampoo should, it weighs down you hair and leaves you debating whether you sprayed enough on there.  The smell is nice, but overpowering.  I had people at work ask me if I overdid it on the body spray.Don‚Äôt buy this - there are other dry shampoo brands out there that will work better!"

I would give this company 0 stars if I could!!  This product is awful, exactly opposite of described, left my hair extremely oily and flat. The company doesn't state a no return policy in the ad, but will not refund my money, they say they are too small to accept returns but would be happy to give me a nominal discount on my next order...like I would EVER order from this terrible company again! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! HORRIBLE COMPANY!! REALLY HORRIBLE PRODUCTS!!! DECEITFUL, MISLEADING, AND REALLY SUBSTANDARD PRODUCTS!!"
95,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE!!,"i really like this dry shampoo for a nice/fresh touch up. It doesn't leave your hair feeling nasty and dry/staticky like every other dry shampoo I've tried. it freshens up mildly oily hair without affecting the texture. My hair tends to get really oily really fast, this dry shampoo might not take the oil out as well as some other brands, but you cant beat the feel & result from this stuff, and it last all day! I didn't have a problem with it leaving powder in my hair like some other reviews mentioned (if you hold&spray one section of your hair for over 5 seconds you might see some powder on the hair, but you'd really have to try to get the powder to build up & be visible like that)Overall I defiantly would recommend this product, and will for sure buy more in the future"
96,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, just not much product in bottle.","Love how well this works! Doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast at all! It is a VERY strong stream which makes it make a louder noise than most dry shampoos.Most of the reason I‚Äôm giving 4 instead of 5 starts is because there isn‚Äôt much product in the bottle.Most bottles last me a month or 2 but this one doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs going to last more than 2 weeks, maybe 3. And I really don‚Äôt want to have to buy it every 2 weeks. So I‚Äôll be trying a different product before going back to this one. It‚Äôs better than not your mothers if you are looking for a comparison."
97,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Lightweight,"I actually enjoy this dry shampoo. I have thin hair and I'm used to dry shampoo stiffening my hair and making it impossible to run your fingers through. Most dry shampoos dry out my hair. However, this dry shampoo is extremely lightweight. It's the only dry shampoo ive found that actually restores my hair close to it's freshly washed feel and it doesn't leave any residue. It doesn't dry it out and it feels fresh. If you're someone with thicker hair, it may not be best. O do wish it came in a larger size as well."
98,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Dry Shampoo / Conditioner,"Just purchased both the dry shampoo and conditioner. I have had several surgeries recently and am unable to take standard showers. The dry shampoo I typically use is quite expensive so was looking for an alternative. I've never used a dry conditioner prior to this and couldn't be more pleased with the results. They both smell incredible and work just as promised. My hair has grown dry and brittle because I've not been able to use conditioner for so long. Cake's dry conditioner instantly (and I mean instantly) removed the frizz, added shine, and made my hair more manageable. I've actually never used any Cake products before as this was the first I'd seen of it. I was able to purchase 2 products with money left to spare in comparison of the shampoo I am used to purchasing. Thumbs up with another thumbs up."
99,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!!!,The best dry shampoo you could ever purchase!! And it is so affordable!

103,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,"This stuff is awful. Not only did it not absorb the oil in my air, but the smell was so overpowering.

I've been a hairdresser for 13yrs and have lots of experience with products. This one goes on clear, perfect for any hair color. Smells like cupcakes! I buy mine from sephora at the same price."
108,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,No bueno,This is far from a dry shampoo. The spray is not at all absorbent. I received unwanted whiffs of my overpowering scented hair all day long.

Yes!","If you want to walk around smelling like you are wearing a vanilla cupcake on your head then by all means, this product is for you!I‚Äôve used it multiple times and I can‚Äôt truly say it‚Äôs made a huge difference. My hair isn‚Äôt significantly oily, so I can‚Äôt tell."
111,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells AMAZING!,I use this for the scent only.. lol.I'm obsessed with the scent.But seeing as I have very dark brown hair..the only kind of dry shampoo that doesn't leave white residue is Eva Nyc brand.. But it's way too expensive for me to purchase especially as often as I use dry shampoo!
112,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stinky!,I only gave this one star because 0 wasn‚Äôt an option. It smells horrible and cannot be returned. I ordered two and threw them both away! Smells like a strong spice smell.

115,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesnt work!,It doesnt work! It looks like hairspray on your hair then it disappears leaving it still looking dirty.
116,"Cake Beauty The Do Gooder Volumizing Dry Shampoo, 200 ML",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for Blonde, Fine Hair","This dry shampoo doesn‚Äôt turn your hair white.

0,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,This one is definately worth it!,"Among all the other products I've tried this is the ONLY one I will ever use from now on. Smells great, no white cast, no greasy feeling, literally lasts days, feels soft and healthy. I would say it's better than some of the high end ones I've used. I highly recommend this product. If your looking for one and cant decide which one  you want let me tell you that this is the one you want. I even use it on my kids hair. Make sure you only spray the conditioner on lower-mid to bottom sections of the hair not the roots bc your natural oils or a dry shampoo is meant for the roots and top of the hair area not the dry conditioner. Trust me you won't be disappointed. Buy it and you'll see! Your welcome!!!"
1,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unbelievably bad smell, poor performance","I bought this because I often have frizzy ends on next day hair and Brand Mondo recommended it in a video. 1) He VASTLY understated how terrible this smells. I can't stand it. It seems like cigarette smoke blended with cake frosting and antifreeze and it's absolutely revolting. I felt bad for those nearby the entire day after I used it. 2) it makes my ends really stiff. Like they looked better, but you could brush them straight out. So after my hair sat on my shoulders it got a super obvious dent.Unfortunately this is not only a wouldn't buy again, its also throw out what you have left. Yuck!"
2,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,I didn't expect it to be so nice!,"A person previously said they followed Brad Mondo's recommendation to get this and they were disappointed. I completely disagree, Mondo was right. No residue, instantly detangled, and made it much smoother. The only downside is that the great smell wears off quickly and leaves just an okay smell. It also doesn't seem like there is a whole lot in the bottle like other dry shampoos, but it's a good price so I'm happy. I'm definitely buying more."
3,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm usually a snob,"I don't typically make it a habit to purchase cheap beauty products because I've learned you get what you pay for and I'd rather spend more than waste any.... but I saw a Brad Mondo video in which he reviewed this product and another and I'm like, well, I like cake... I like good hair... I can spare like 6 bucks... why not? and I did it (YOLO).I am not disappointed AT ALL. I sprayed this on my hair when it wasn't really even in the ""need a dry wash"" moment. Tbh, I typically hate dry shampoo because it's gross and leaves this weird white residue that makes it look like December on my scalp. But I also hate washing my hair, so it's really a torn issue. Anyway....I sprayed this on my hair and give it a little finger through and got the perfect beach waves I've been trying to achieve for YEARS.BONUS: my hair smells like cake."

5,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",4.0 out of 5 stars,It worked very well for curling hair.,"So i‚Äôm going to say, my hair did feel softer after using the product but I would not say it looked any better (or worse), however my hair refuses to hold a curl / wave for more then a few minutes, they fall before so can even finish getting my makeup on and out of the bathroom. I tried SO many products and texturing sprays and hairsprays etc. I did not even purchase this to help with curling but I thought i‚Äôd try it - and my curls put in the a flat iron stayed in place all day (and are still in place). That‚Äôs AMAZING for my hair! I sprayed it mids to ends, making sure to lift my hair, then dry shampooed my scalp and brushed through. A few minutes later I curled.So it‚Äôs a bit hard for me to rate. I don‚Äôt really get it as a dry conditioner, in my opinion that wasn‚Äôt impressive. However, i‚Äôm extremely happy to have found something that lets my curls stay in."
6,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stinks to bad to leave in,"The product smelled so chemically I could not stand it and within a 1/2 hour had to wash my hair.  The product may be good, but I couldn‚Äôt stand it in my hair long enough to give a decent review as the stench was so bad.  Absolutely does not smell like cake, or anything good.  It smelled more like kerosene to me."
7,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,It is not a dry shampoo it is a conditioner.,"I purchased this the first time intending to purchase a dry shampoo. However! It may not have solved that issue but it solved a lot of other issues related to my hair woes. This is amazing for people who suffer from frizzy hair issues or want to add or improve their hair shine. It leaves your ends soft and shiny, and the scent is DIVINE. Sometimes I use a little {even if I do not need it} because I love how it smells and my husband loves the smell. They need a body spray of this stuff, I am not kidding. I just bought my second bottle and still loving it!"
8,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great! Good price and value! Doesn‚Äôt smell good.,"I DO like this product. It does what it says it is going to do. Condition your hair. You have to be light handed with this because if you use too much it will make your hair really greasy! The only problem I have is the smell! I expected it to smell really good since it‚Äôs called ‚Äúcake‚ÄùBut the smell is really off putting. You CAN smell a little cake in there. But it‚Äôs mixed with this strong chemical smell. Doesn‚Äôt keep me from using it. Just wish it smelled better. All Cake products I have tried smell the same way! But they work well,"
9,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product keeps a blow out fresh for a Week!!!,I can get a week out of a blow out with this magic in a can. I agree Any Smell would be better than this but it doesn‚Äôt last long. It smells like actual cake. It does keep your hair amazingly fresh looking and shiny for days. Doesn‚Äôt seem to build up either. So it‚Äôs spray brush and go!!!  Gloss boss is amazing too for really humid days. Very conditioning. They need to tone down the smell though.
10,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Drying,This gives the illusion of softness then a day later your hair is soo dry and you start getting split ends the whole spray conditioner thing is a hoax i didnt think about the fact that most aerosol sprays are alcohol and as we know alcohol is severely drying to the hair if you care about your hair dont use ANY aerosol conditioner spray just get a watery leave in conditioner and put it in a fine continuous mist bottle
11,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn‚Äôt for me,I wanted to love this product I have dry hair and can never get enough conditioning.

12,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a dry shampoo,"I am not a fan! It doesn‚Äôt work like a dry shampoo at all! It just adds more oil and greasiness. It does make the hair soft but it‚Äôs only soft because it‚Äôs so oily and slick. The smell is a bit overwhelming and although it goes away after a while, it‚Äôs a really tough smell to get used to every time you use it. I tried to return and they won‚Äôt take it. Definitely don‚Äôt buy if you‚Äôre going off of what Brad Mondo said in his video!!"
13,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Makes hair oily, not dry shampoo","Bought this under a Brad Mondo recommendation, as he tried this product out as a dry shampoo.  THIS IS NOT A DRY SHAMPOO.  This is literally the opposite of a dry shampoo.  As the bottle says it is a dry conditioner, so it is supposed to add sheen, not take it away.  However, it even is terrible at that job.  Perfectly clean hair turns oily and slick looking like I haven't washed it in a few days.  It does not make hair softer or give it a natural sheen.  Also, it smells terrible. 10/10 do not recommend."

16,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Bought because of a silly online review and boy I am glad I did. Yes smells sweet like cake. Not may preference but totally tolerable and worth the benefits. The sweet smell dissipates and leaves your hair so soft and looking/feeling great. I have very bleached/grey hair which is coarse and dry. This worked for me.

I had watched a brad mondo video recommending this, I sincerely hope it was a fluke. The smell is sweet but has an acrid, almost smoke smell too. It doesn‚Äôt reduce the appearance of oil at all. It‚Äôs ‚Äúmoisturizing‚Äù so it sprays more oil on. It‚Äôs beyond disappointing. And for claiming it‚Äôs good for your hair, the first ingredient is alcohol. Don‚Äôt waste your money like I did."

Not like other Cake products I have purchased before. Strong sickly sweet smell at first that fades quickly. The conditioner works okay (better than the shampoo which doesn't work, like at all), but not really as advertised.

116,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as great as I would have liked,I‚Äôve tried a lot of dry shampoos and this is one of my least favorites. I used a few times and then just threw away. I disagree about the smell being nice. I think it smells like cake and chemicals. It‚Äôs true that it doesn‚Äôt leave any white powder but it takes a ton of product to get rid of any grease and it doesn‚Äôt last all day like many other products do. The spray radius is huge so product goes all over the bathroom and in your face. There are definitely better alternatives.

118,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"As someone with thick, curly hair, I love this stuff.

It also smells like cake which I love!
121,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just didn‚Äôt do what I wanted it to,"It was ok, I was expecting a cake smell but it doesn‚Äôt smell like any cake I‚Äôve had. It also doesn‚Äôt seem to have the effect I was hoping for. I wash my hair once a week and do a conditioner rinse once a week to keep the moisture. So I bought this to use between those days to keep my hair smelling nice and to bring more moisture throughout the week, this didn‚Äôt provide much moisture at least not anything noticeable. Also in case you want to know I have naturally dark blonde hair but I bleach it and keep it pastel pink, I also only wash my hair once a week since I used acutane a few years ago and if I wash my hair too often my scalp gets extremely dry it also makes my hair dryer than most since I dont produce as much oils which is why I wanted this product to work for me and why I do a mid week conditioner rinse."
122,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works really well - the scent is weird,"So as an adult, I don't exactly want to smell like birthday cake (I think that's what they were going for). But the product does a great job at trapping those oils to help the hair live another day without a wash. I had tried the tresemme and was disappointed in the high end brand leaving white residue. This wasn't the case with this product. Will stomach the scent for the one or two days a month that I use dry shampoo."
123,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me,"Scent is pleasant with a chemical undertone which doesn't bother me. It did make my hair smooth , easy to brush through, and did not leave any white cast (I have dark brown hair), but did not work as a dry shampoo in taking out next day oily hair. It in fact made my hair look oilier. I do have fine thin hair, so I really needed a product to work as a dry shampoo. Didn't work for me and was not able to return because its an aerosol product which bummed me out."

125,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great...,"I love dry conditioner, especially as it can help combat the dryness of dry shampoo. The Only other one I have used is the Kristen Ess brand from target. I absolutely love that one and it truly makes my hair soft and shiny. This one has a really odd cake smell that is gross and I can‚Äôt tell where it makes my hair shiny or soft"
126,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Gross,This might make my hair slightly softer but the fragrance is unbearably strong and I can't use it. Everyone in the house complains about how strong it is. I also feel like this is marketed as clean but with a fragrance like that there is no way this is nontoxic.

The aerosol fumes are the most overpowering and strongest of any hairspray or can of deodorant I've ever used.  I had to turn the fan on and hold my breath until I could leave the room.  I tried to return this to Amazon and am unable to...awesome...I picked one up for a gift as well.  Now I'm out over $20 bucks. Cool."
129,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt bother,This product is terrible! If I could give no stars I would have. It does not help at all. All it does is make your hair look wet and greasy/oily. Do not waste your money.

150,"CAKE Beauty The Locks Smith Dry Styling, Hydrating Dry Conditioner Spray,White, 4.7 Ounce (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ya'll need to READ the product name ppl! lol,"Most of the people who have left reviews really may need to purchase some reading glasses prior to purchasing or using new products! lol. This is a dry CONDITIONER.... NOT a dry shampoo! A dry shampoo is used on the outgrowth/roots of the hair closest to the scalp, which is made to help absorb oil in between washes. Dry CONDITIONER is made to be used MID SHAFT OF HAIR STRANDS TO THE ENDS of the hair. It's going to make your hair look greasy and oily if you don't use it properly, and instead spray it on your hair at the scalp. *INSERT FACEPALM EMOJI HERE* It's no different than using conditioner in the shower properly.... You really shouldn't use that on your scalp either.... at least an inch or so out at the minimum, to the ends. Conditioners are made to HYDRATE.... if you use them improperly, they will always make hair look greasy and dirty! This is to help fight frizz and dull ends from brushing repeatedly, because the ends need the moisture and extra oil. NOT YA'LLS SCALP! LOL"

Well, I have news for you, it smells like delicious cake AND ALSO a billow from a chainsmoker.However, what's interesting to me as someone who is SENSITIVE to perfumes, after I put it on this does not bother me- doesn't make me sneeze and doesn't overpower the senses like SO MANY other dry conditioners/perfumes.I wouldn't wear it on a date night, but just by yourself, totally fine. Does it moisturize my hair perfectly without making it greasy? Yup. Does the job."

Lightweight, non greasy, can use every day to add hydration and moisture to hair between washes. Scent is what I was expecting based on the rest of the line - slight vanilla cake scent."
0,"Cake Beauty The Wave Maker Texturizing Beach Spray, 4 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural looking ends,"My routine is: after towel drying my hair I part it, brush it out well (because I don't want to brush the curls out later after it dries) and I spray a good amount of this into my palm and then run through the ends of my wet hair. I pin it or put it up, and I don't touch my hair again as it sets up and dries. My hair spirals up into perfect curls (on the ends) as it dries. I have thick hair that is half curly, half straight, and 100% frizzy. My hair is too thick to curl throughout with out heat.This helps my hair get it together, calm down, coordinate itself, and looks very natural. Do not brush after hair has dried with product. You'll separate the curls (if that's what you're going for) and my hair likes to frizz back up if I run a brush through it."
1,"Cake Beauty The Wave Maker Texturizing Beach Spray, 4 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Lovely on thin hair, not so much thick hair","So I'm gonna give this 3 stars, but with a caveat.  I have SUPER thick, very straight hair.  It doesn't cooperate with a lot of things - especially styling spray that are meant to be lighter, which this one is.  Because of that, it's texturizing effects leave a bit to be desired for me personally.  That being said, my daughter's hair is a lot thinner than mine and it works beautifully on her.  I'll curl her hair and spray this, and it adds that extra edge.  Plus it actually helps keep her curls all day.  Spray it in her damp hair, and she's got a beautiful ""beach day"" kind of look.Basically, I recommend this for thinner, more cooperative hair.  Thick, stick-straight hair owners may want to rethink it, unless they want super subtle texture (or AMAZING smelling hair.)"
2,"Cake Beauty The Wave Maker Texturizing Beach Spray, 4 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing !!,I have very curly fine hair. I wash with Cake shampoo and conditioner. I apply when hair is wet and comb through. Absolute ringlets no frizz. Not stiff or drying.  Leaves my hair soft and free moving ! Love it just amazing
3,"Cake Beauty The Wave Maker Texturizing Beach Spray, 4 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my hair!!!,"I love this product for my hair. Does exactly as advertised. Only thing is...you need to be careful how much you put in your hair or it will make it feel sticky. If you use the right amount it gives great wavy curls but may not be as good for those with thick dense curls. I only say that because my daughter has that hair and it doesn‚Äôt do the same thing for hers as it does mine, but I still would highly recommend giving this product a try."
4,"Cake Beauty The Wave Maker Texturizing Beach Spray, 4 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY GOOD,"I love Cake products, but I'm always worried about Beach spray being crunchy after it dries... this spray is great,, leaves my hair w/ nice loose, shiny y curl & a light sweet scent,, LOVE IT!!"

It's not aerosol so it sprays quite a thick stream.  Then I tried spraying this into my hands, rubbing them briefly together and then scrunched it on my hair.  Beautiful, soft piecey look.  Much better than salt sprays, which leave my hair dry, hard., but sticky.  if you have short hair try using it the way I do.  I'm sure you'll like this."

Literally the worst product I‚Äôve ever used in my hair. First off, the lid doesn‚Äôt even fit the bottle. Minor issue, major annoyance. Second, it‚Äôs like they just put sugar and syrup in a bottle. It‚Äôs the stickiest product I‚Äôve ever felt. It‚Äôs just feels thick and sticky and gross. It makes my hair feel awful. I feel like it called cake because when I use it, it feels like I took frosting off a cake, put it in my hair and spread it around. It‚Äôs disgusting. I‚Äôve never had this issue with any other texturizing / wave making spray. 0/10 would never purchase again."

It works, and not it pumps up the volume of your hair, but it also adds a great deal of stickiness. Also, it's delivery method is a little odd. Blowing powder into the root of your hair isn't a strange thing per se, but this doesn't seem to deliver it in an even flow. Probably will not purchase again. I love the other Cake products though! The hairspray for example is terrific!"

It has about 15 minutes of hold or less.  This is not going to hold your fancy updo, or your grocery store run look. Your hair is absolutely brushable after you use this, but that's because it has no hold. Sorry cake, I really wanted to love you."
2,"Cake Beauty Hold Out Flexible Vegan Hairspray with Vitamin E - Lightweight Hairspray for Volume, Hold & Anti Frizz - Sulfate Free & Cruelty Free Hair Spray - Curly Hair Styling Products for Women",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I wanted for my wavy hair,"Once again, I trusted other reviews and shouldn't have,  when will I learn. I have fine, naturally wavy hair. I use hairspray to help control frizz and keep my hair from getting crazy duringtheday. I didn't notice any great scent. It wasn't as heavy as other sprays, but it was still a bit crunchy on my hair. It didn't last the day as far as keeping my hair in place. Not worth the price. I'm on the search again for a good flexible hold hairspray."
3,"Cake Beauty Hold Out Flexible Vegan Hairspray with Vitamin E - Lightweight Hairspray for Volume, Hold & Anti Frizz - Sulfate Free & Cruelty Free Hair Spray - Curly Hair Styling Products for Women",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holds fine hair without helmet head!!!!,"I love this hairspray!  I have very fine hair that requires products to create and hold a style.  I only buy cruelty free items and am sensitive to scents.  Cake's hairspray has a lovely, sweet scent that is not overpowering at all.  (I can't fathom what others are talking about who say the scent was overpowering and reeking of chemicals - that's not my experience at all and I've now been through more than five cans of this hairspray!)  I wear a gentle, buttery vanilla perfume and it complements that nicely.  The hairspray applicator is nice and light, but also powerful so be sure to hold the can a bit away from your head so you don't disturb your style while applying.  I can curl my hair in the morning and still have nice waves by that night.  (For someone whose hair resists curling as much as mine does, this is extraordinary!)  My hair isn't crunchy, there's no helmet head (thank God!), and I can comb through my hair and still have style.  I now subscribe and go through a can every six weeks or so.  If you are looking for flexible hold that works for fine, curl resistant hair, get this stuff!"

I have now turned into a hair spray user after finding this!PSGave it to my mom to try since she was having a bad time with her hair too. She loves the product as well!

I like the product and use it all the time.  However, when I received this bottle of spray, the packaging looked very different that what was shown on the listing - the color of the bottle was different, there were 2 strange blue lines, and it was in a different language with lots of warning labels.  I didn't feel comfortable using it since it looked so different than the normal bottle...I was worried it was a knock-off.  I appreciated that Amazon gave me a refund on something that just didn't look right."

It's lightweight and brushable, so no crunchy hair.  The hold lasts me all day, even after my hair has been combed through multiple times.But the best feature, by far, is the SCENT!!!  OMG!  It smells like an iced sugar cookie!  Or maybe birthday cake.  No weird chemical or perfume-y smells.  I am so used to holding my breath while I use hairspray and then running out of the bathroom while the exhaust fan is on.  Not with this stuff.  Although I will warn you..... it WILL make you hungry!  Will 10/10 be trying more of their products!"

I guess I was expecting a typical large-size can of hairspray such as you get with other premium brands.  While this isn't a travel size, it's about half the size (5.5 oz) of other hairsprays I've used, which are usually 10 oz.  Other than that, it does have a sweet smell (hence the name Cake) which I wasn't quite expecting.  Younger women and teens might appreciate the smell more than mature women such as myself :)"

Apparently this is a constant problem with this shipper.  My hairspray came in a peach colored can with blue words on it was in a different language and has warning signs all over it.

0,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,"Alright, a lot of people in the reviews are saying this doesn‚Äôt wash your hair have probably never used a sulfate free shampoo or know hot to use it. You are supposed to wash twice with sulfate free shampoo. The second time of washing after rinsing the first wash out will become sudsy, and that washes your hair. Focus on your scalp, especially if you have thick hair, and as you rinse it washes the rest of your hair. I love this shampoo, it‚Äôs probably my new favorite. It smells good, it works well, and it‚Äôs at an amazing price."
1,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not go for folliculitis?,"Caused a worse break out of my folliculitis, blisters all over my head...."
2,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,It sucks.,The smell is awful. Makes my hair feel just as dirty as it was before i washed it. I wish I could get a refund. Maybe it and the conditioner I bought will make good shaving cream :/
3,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Overpowering smell,"Any benefits this product might have is obliterated by the stench of harshly artificial cake/candy smell. I asked my cousin to try it, she's a Bath and Bodyworks girl, and she couldn't take the smell either."
4,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Works fine but the SMELL IS ATROCIOUS,"The shampoo is whatever. It was fine for my colored hair and didn't strip the color out, but I will not be using it more than the ONE time, much less ever purchase it again because the smell is overpowering and NOT pleasant. I should have known when they changed the velveteen hand lotion formula from the berry, milk & vanilla to this new concoction that smells almost as bad as this shampoo that I shouldn't try my luck, but I was hopeful because the original lotion that hooked me was SO good. But no. Every time I got a whiff of my dried hair, I wanted to gag. Even put unnecessarily oils in my hair to dampen the smell.Will not be buying any Cake products again. Whatever new formulas they've switched to in the last few years have been disgusting on all fronts.Don't buy unless your sense of smell is very poor.Only reason it's not a 1 star is because the actual shampoo is fine. It's just got an atrocious scent."
5,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible,"This stuff completely stripped my hair, smells horrible, and comes out like glue.

8,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing price! Smells great!,I had purchased this at the local drug store and my daughter loved it but it was expensive. So glad to find this for less than half on Amazon!
9,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Something is off,"I have bought this shampoo before and loved it with no issues. This time it had such a strong smell that burned my nose, and after I used it my scalp was itching pretty bad. I don't know if this is an old batch or something but buyer beware. Safer to buy from their official website."
10,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Astringent smell,I had high hopes for this shampoo because I liked Cake's old lemon and creme shampoo but this is just not good. It has a chemical smell which ruins the whole premise of dessert themed bath products. And my hair feels quite dry after using it.  I was incredibly disappointed.
11,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle Shampoo for Oily Hair,"I have very thin, fine hair that gets oily easily and needs to be washed every day. I decided to buy this shampoo because I thought I was allergic to sulfates (I‚Äôm not) but this is a miracle shampoo for thin oily hair. Seriously, this stuff removes all the grime and build up every time. When my hair gets oily it‚Äôs not as gross and noticeable. I finally feel comfortable not washing my hair every day. Highly recommend."
12,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Why does everyone say this smells good?,I bought the shampoo and conditioner with the curl cream. The selling point for me was how it smelled so nice. Not only does it not smell nice it actually is repulsive to me. I gave them to my daughter and she said it made her hair smell like she had been at a campfire all night.
13,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the only shampoo my daughter will use,My 18 year old daughter loves this shampoo. I suggest any other shampoo and conditioner she simply says no.  She has super thick hair that is on the oily side.  Her hair is so thick that it is actually hard to get all the shampoo out of her hair but this clears her scalp wonderfully. Give it a try.
14,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Truly doesn't even deserve 1 star,"Sooo disappointed in this shampoo! I love love the Cake lotions and incorrectly assumed since those were super moisurizing their shampoo would be similar at least. NOPE. It makes your hair feel like hay! It sucks all the moisture out of your hair and the smell is terrible. The texture is very strange, too. I've never returned shampoo before, but at almost $10 bucks this is definitely going back."
15,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,Smells like candy! Washes great and is perfect with its matching conditioner. I love the fact that it's full of good stuff and contains no nasty chemicals.
16,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great shampoo,I have fine thinning hair that gets greasy without the proper shampoo. This stuff works great! I‚Äôm a daily washer but my hair is always bouncy and hydrated. Love this stuff!
17,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,My hair did not like it,"It smelled bad. Which disappointed me because the mousse smells so good.

18,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Shampoo I‚Äôve Used,"This cleans my hair like nothing I‚Äôve ever used before. There‚Äôs a light lemon sugar cookie scent that really makes me happy. A small amount strips must hair of oil completely, lather is also great, rinses easily."
19,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair Stripper,"This shampoo is very thick and smells like artificial gingerbread.

25,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely worth it,"I absolutely love this shampoo. It does dry out your hair but if you pair it with the Soft Serve condition it balances it out, atleast for me it did."

47,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,No shampoo,"All I got was the bottle... completely empty, no shampoo at all, just the bottle."
48,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good buy,Made my hair very frizzy and a different texture
49,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,2a/b combo with fine hair,"I adore this shampoo. No it doesn‚Äôt lather (sulfate free) and should predominantly be worked into the roots and rinsed through the rest of the hair. The conditioner should be used in reverse, worked in to the ends of hair and just glazed over the rest. Rinse briefly with cold water.It smells like a sweet vanilla cake with a hint of spice.Anyone with type 2 hair knows frizz can be an issue, this product lets me simply wash and go."
50,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Grease.,"Thought it was perfect!I like trying something new than my normal Love Beauty & Plant shampoos.The smell was so strong & smelt so unbelievably scrumptious, cruelty free & I mean Canada made-hell yeah I thought.No.The smelt was all in the bottle, not in my hair.By the next morning my hair looked incredibly greasy.Although there was volume like a mother! It does feel heavy of product no matter how much you think you rinsed it out. I was burning through cans of dry shampoo to not look like a bum.For people that have more oil hair than dry this is not the stuff for you."
51,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cruelty-free shampoo that lathers!,"I‚Äôve only started using these for a week (I got conditioner as well) and I‚Äôm loving the results. I find it does lather well and it smells nice and clean. I thought it‚Äôd be like the other cruelty-free shampoos I‚Äôve tried before, ones where my hair never felt clean. I‚Äôm also glad it doesn‚Äôt smell cloyingly sweet.Also, I wash my hair only every other day but I find with using regular shampoo, my hair feels limp and oily already without a day of washing (but if I do everyday, it becomes too dry and stripped!). But with using the Cake line, it does live up to its claims with my hair still feeling bouncy and oil-free."
52,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's okay, not great","This shampoo smells great, like candy almost.  It's low sulfate, so it doesn't lather up a bunch.  If definitely cleans my hair, but leaves it really dry and hard to untangle.  I have fine, wavy, chin length hair, and it tends to leave my hair looking flat by the end of the day.  It's not a terrible shampoo, but for the price, I won't buy it again."
53,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like pumpkin bread,"Idk why, but by the name of this product I thought it would‚Äôve smelled like cake.It doesn‚Äôt.It smells like pumpkin bread, which isn‚Äôt bad, but not what I was expecting.It it sulfate free, but it has a sulfonate, and I feel that that is what gave my hair that ‚Äúsqueaky clean‚Äù feel that I hate.I wouldn‚Äôt buy again.And if your like ‚Äúpumpkin bread smelling shampoo sounds cool‚Äù don‚Äôt even think about the conditioner, it‚Äôs even worse."
54,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,What is that smell?,"Curious as to what the thought process was when deciding on a fragrance for their products. What is that??!! I cant even describe how awful smelling this shampoo is. With a name like Cake‚Ä¶.you would think it would smell great, not whatever this scent is."
55,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,awful,doesn't lather much at all and my hair felt horribly dry after washing and using the cake conditioner.  waste of money.
56,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality,"Strange smell & made my hair feel like straw, I bought conditioner too. Very disappointed unfortunately."
57,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,THIS SMELLS TERRIBLE,"I DON'T KNOW WHO IS SAYING THIS SMELLS LIKE CANDY OR LEMONS, BUT IT SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING CRAWLED INTO THE BOTTLE AND DIED. SAME WITH THE CONDITIONER. I HAVE TO SHOWER AT NIGHT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SMELL TO LINGER ALL DAY. TRULY AWFUL."
58,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a shampoo that lives up to it's promise,"I have shaggy cut (think young Keith Richards), medium length, fine hair that other shampoos (even very expensive ones) either leave straggly and weighed down or dry as straw.  I used Cake Posh Wash Shampoo for the first time this morning and can't believe the difference.  My hair is bouncy, shiny and my natural waves are amplified.  It looks better than it has in years. I'm stocking up & pray they don't quit making it."
59,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as promised!,"I found that this shampoo actually lived up to its claims. I have VERY thin wavy hair, that normally I have to wash every day because it gets so greasy. This morning I was able to go to work without having to wash my hair, and my hair wasn‚Äôt greasy at all. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about this, is the smell. I saw other reviewers saying it smelled great, like cake. I did not find it to smell like cake, and found the scent to be kind of nauseating, but it luckily doesn‚Äôt linger."
60,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Looove it,"I have always struggled with very thin, dry/oily hair... and have tried many shampoos but nothing has worked. Cake shampoo made me feel a difference with just 2 days of washing it. My hair feels great, it‚Äôs not as frizzy, it doesn‚Äôt get oily and yet has a great healthy shine to it. Aside from that it made my hair color look more vibrant. Yes, the smell sucks but it‚Äôs totally worth it"
61,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,This product did not give me any added volume. It weighs  my hair down and I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again. I don‚Äôt like the smell either!
62,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells Great!,"Love this brand and the shampoo is just another quality product. Smells great, rinses clean and leaves my hair looking great. Thank you!"
63,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best shampoo ever!!!,I absolutely love this product!!! This makes my long hair so smooth and thick and keeps it from getting greasy the next day!
64,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great!!!,"My daughter loves the smell.  Her hair is fine. It made it silky, smooth, and shiny.  She says it is ‚Äúamazing‚Äù and ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù."

66,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,If you care about your hair don‚Äôt buy cake shampoo,This is one of the worse shampoos I‚Äôve ever used. It was horrible for my hair. And it does not smell good. The conditioner is horrible too
67,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Day 2 and Day 3 still look really good,This is the best.  I only wash my hair every five days or so.  I love the smell and it keeps it nice and clean.  My hair loss seems to have reduced (radiation causes it to fall out some) some now that may or may not be from the shampoo but I will say this hasn‚Äôt hurt it.
68,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Destructive to natural oils,I got this product for my wife and it absolutely destroyed her hair and the natural oils in her hair. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on any person.
69,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs ok,Before started using this product my hair was falling out just  a little bit and have been using this for a couple months and my hair comes out even more I wouldn‚Äôt recommend
70,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,"After thinking about it for a while, I decided to purchase this. The smell is fantastic but it leaves a dull feeling, my hair feels greasy after only a couple of hours and is almost impossible to get some volume. Won't be purchasing again and won't recommend it."
71,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Stinks,Made my hair soft and smooth but absolutely cannot stand the smell. I can stand some pretty gross smells (im a nurse) and this literally made me gag.
72,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",Size: 9.98 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Reasonably good shampoo,  left my 3A hair soft. The smell is the deal breaker. Smells like a really bad air freshener version of spice cake. Chemicals! Does not dissipate when dry. Gave me a headache and a bit of a nauseous feeling over the day. Not sure what they were thinking with this. Won't be able to continue to use it."
73,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",Size: 9.98 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Love the mild scent ! Moisturizing, creamy, not tested on animals."
74,"Cake Beauty Posh Wash Sulfate-free Swirl Shampoo, 10 Ounces",Size: 9.98 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Smelled pretty good from the bottle, then when washing and after my hair just smelled like chemicals. Terrible and made my hair feel straw like afterwards."

0,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Complete Miss,"Cake has a lot of great products but this is not one of them. Yes, it comes out of the bottle like icing and smells delicious but like other reviewers, it left my hair heavy and oily. I should not have to use dry shampoo the same day I wash my hair. If you leave it on for 60 seconds or less, it may help. I'm bummed I won't be buying this again."
1,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silky smooth conditioner,"My 18 year old daughter loves this conditioner (and it‚Äôs shampoo). I suggest any other shampoo and conditioner she simply says no.  She has super thick hair that is on the oily side.  Her hair is so thick that it is actually hard to get all the shampoo out of her hair but this clears her scalp wonderfully. Try the hair mask as well, it is wonderful. Give it a try."
2,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely adore this,I absolutely love this brand and especially this conditioner. A lot of comments talk about how it leaves your hair heavy/oily feeling and I could definitely see that. I use this and then I pair it with the Posh Wash and it is a great combo. The posh Wash dries out your hair and this adds moisture to it in a good way.
3,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scent and Texture to Make You Drool,"The scent is delectable, the texture is creamy and thick, a small amount coats all of my thick hair. I usually rinse, towel dry and rub a drop into my hair after for some soft and shine, with an extra hit of that scent."
4,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly light so that my naturally curly hair looked beautiful!,I have naturally curly hair and I absolutely love every product I have tried from Cake!!! The regular conditioner that I usually use (by Cake) was unavailable so I purchased this one instead. I was completely satisfied. It was so light that my hair curled beautifully!
5,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Small bottles,Nice scent and does feel good on your hair.However I noticed that you have to use a lot more conditioner and you run out of conditioner before you run out of shampoo
6,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,DUPE,"I'm gonna start off by saying, I'm OBSESSED with the Cake brand. I've switched out all of my beauty products. I originally found them at Walgreen's and was so sooo happy with all the products I tried.Trying to stay out of stores due to Covid, I decided to order on here... This conditioner is NOT the same one from Walgreen's. This is absolutely 100% a dupe. This one left my hair feeling waxy and this has NOT been my experience with Cake products (this one specifically) in the past when bought in store. Just a warning!"
7,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,My hair feels great,"Kind of small bottle, but smells really good and makes my hair look amazing. Really great brand."
8,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stinks!!,The product stinks like artificial gingerbread and my head is tingling from the strong level of spicy fragrance in the product!! It is not moisturizing at all and using the shampoo leaves your hair feeling dry and over processed. Dollar Tree quality.
9,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth a try!,"Great smell and love it!My hair is very fine and it‚Äôs hard to find products that don‚Äôt make my hair greasy, this doesn‚Äôt."
10,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a great smell but does wonders for your hair,Again the scent needs work it doesn't smell great it's a very strange smell but it is a great conditioner it leaves your hair free of weigh down and moisturizes your hair definitely my new go to!

24,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont waste your money,Leaves your hair feeling stiff and heavy
25,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs okay,This is doesn‚Äôt work good in my thick hair and it doesn‚Äôt smell the greatest.

31,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love Cake conditioner & Shampoo,The smell is great. Makes my hair super soft.
32,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ice creamy dreamy!,"About my hair:  bleached and toned (platinum), normal to oily leaning more towards oily, thick hair with fine strands.Water: hard water, city waterI purchased my bottle from Walgreens during a buy one get one half off sale. I haven't had much luck finding a cruelty free brand so despite the sale I was hesitant to purchase more than one bottle of each product (I also have The Posh Wash and The Big Deal as well as The Do Gooder). I wish I had enough time to test them up for a few weeks before the sale ended because I definitely would have bought the entire shelf.The Soft Serve is very pleasant smelling and the scent sticks around for longer than other washing products I have used which is bonus! It leaves my hair silky smooth and doesn't weigh it down. I do have the habit of over rinsing my hair because my hair is bleached so much it always feels a little ""soapy"" when wet. That said I use lukdwarm water, I don't know how this product will rinse using hot or cold. I have not experienced the dry or crunchy texture other users have nor an issue with greasiness caused by the conditioner. After using I can easily skip a day and just use a little dry shampoo in my bangs. I can skip two days but I start feeling my scalp get gross, the strands are fine except at my roots.Anyway, I love this stuff!"
33,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's great...for the neighsayers, research your products first.","I love it. Guys, you need to know the right kind of product for your hair. If you have fine or thin hair, this conditioner isn't for you. ""Moisture rich"" hair products are for those of us with thicker, wavier hair or curls.The natural oils on your scalp moisturize your hair fine most of the time if you have fine, thin hair, especially if it's straight. But those oils don't spread OUTWARD for those with waves & curls, and if your hair is thick, that might not be enough...so, MOISTURE RICH PRODUCTS.If you use the wrong product on your hair, it's user error, not the product.I'm in my 40s, early stages of menopause which killed my curls. But my hair is still wavy & I've got tons of it. This & the accompanying shampoo are wonderful.If you have thicker hair &/or waves/curls, highly recommend."
34,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt work for me,"This stuff smells so delicious I wish I could give it five stars. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs one of the worst conditioners I‚Äôve used in years. I have very long, fine, straight hair. This product leaves it coated with something that makes it even harder to get a brush through than normal. It doesn‚Äôt wash out right away, either. I tried washing and using another brand conditioner after this, and there‚Äôs still a coating. I‚Äôm going to have to use clarifying shampoo to get this out. Very disappointed."
35,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great smell, hate what it does to my hair!",I bought this because my hair is thin and it said it makes your hair look full... it doesn't. It leaves your hair greasy as all hell! My hair dries and instantly feels and looks like I put conditioner in my hair and didnt rinse it out. In spots my hair even crunches together like I have left over product in my hair. I used the whole bottle trying different amounts rinsing it forever to see if I wasnt getting it all out and everytime same result. I will never buy this again :( also it made my hair FRIZZY and straw like.
36,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Use if you like greasy hair! YUCK!,"I thought I was going to like this conditioner and the coordinating shampoo, but I HATE IT! I used it several times just to make sure that I didn‚Äôt miss something amazing..... every single time I used it I had to shampoo 3 times in a row because it just didn‚Äôt feel clean. The conditioner was the same thing, after I used the conditioner, rinsed it out and then dried my hair, it was instantly greasy, and heavy feeling. I tried using a tiny amount, but then my hair felt like straw. Really disappointed! They smell was captivating, the product itself, not so much!"
37,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Stank AF and has silicones,"Does NOT smell like cake, which is a huge missed opportunity by this brand. It smells like a Micheals craft store in the fall time.The slip was okay, I‚Äôve had way better & I‚Äôve had worse.I‚Äôll use up the bottle but would definitely not repurchase. Especially since it has silicones."
38,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Must Have,"I bought this at Walgreens to try it and fell in love. But they have been out of it for a month now, so I‚Äôm ordering on Amazon. This product leaves my hair nourished and silky soft. It does not leave it oily or heavy at all. I love the subtle scent also."
39,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Soft but Full,Love both the shampoo and conditioner. This is my first review but reason I‚Äôm writing is I was shocked to see 1 star from only review! It smells glorious (kind of like honey) and left my unruly wavy hair soft yet full.
40,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful!!,"this product is literally so awful, it dried out my hair and left it smelling absolutely terrible, absolutely would not recommend!!"
41,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will dry out your hair,Used it a couple of times. Hair felt so dry and gritty. Immediately  washed it out just so my hair would feel normal.
42,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Works fine but SMELLS AWFUL,"The conditioner is whatever. It was fine for my colored hair and didn't strip the color out, but I will not be using it more than the ONE time, much less ever purchase it again because the smell is overpowering and NOT pleasant. I should have known when they changed the velveteen hand lotion formula from the berry, milk & vanilla to this new concoction that smells almost as bad as this shampoo that I shouldn't try my luck, but I was hopeful because the original lotion that hooked me was SO good. But no. Every time I got a whiff of my dried hair, I wanted to gag. Even put unnecessarily oils in my hair to dampen the smell.Will not be buying any Cake products again. Whatever new formulas they've switched to in the last few years have been disgusting on all fronts.Don't buy unless your sense of smell is very poor.Only reason it's not a 1 star is because the actual conditioner is fine. It's just got an atrocious scent."
43,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Smells bad and didn't work for my hair.,"This smells really artifical and made me hair feel awful. I have 3a ringlets and this made them feel like the Sahara desert. I didn't get far enough to style and see what it looked like because my hair was so disgusting feeling inside the shower that I decided to immediately do a clarifying wash and just start over.I'm not sure what my hair objected to, so it might work great for some people. The scent however I really am not a fan of. Sickly sweet but very artificial"
44,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs ok,Didn‚Äôt have the slip I expected for detangling. Kind of smells like play doh. Nothing special about this product in particular for my naturally curly/wavy hair honestly. I may try some of their other products though.
45,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Has proteins in it which wrecked my hair,"It smelled bad. Which disappointed me because the mousse smells so good. My hair is ok with a little protein, but this made my hair feel like rubber bands and break when it was wet until fully dry. Kind of disappointed."
46,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for fine hair,I have thick but fine soft hair. A normal conditioner is far too heavy but a cream rinse works perfect. It detangles my color treated hair with just the perfect amount of conditioning. The smell is great. I will continue to buy it

48,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Shine and great soft oder,Best smelling rinse I have had in a product..everyone is always saying omg your hair smells so good
49,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best but better than cheaper products,"It‚Äôs okay , not the best but it does give body and smooths"
50,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good with the shampoo,Smells great and is a nice light conditioning that does a heavy job.  I can‚Äôt stand a heavy oily conditioner so this is really surprising how nice it works
51,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,5 stars for me,"I really am surprised at the low reviews, must just not work in all hair types. I love this stuff, it's Tang me forever to find ""the one"" in hair products and this is it for me. My hair is soft and clean and as the product says, it keeps my hair fresh with fewer washes. Busy mom life means I get less time some days for showers so it's nice I can avoid greasy hair!"
52,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Very good made my hair thicker an shiny
53,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"Reasonably good moisture for 3A hair, need to use more than I would like for the price. The scent, however, is pure evil! Very fake air freshener version of spice cake. The smell does not dissipate when dry. Gives me a headache.  I've tried it for a few days but it doesn't get better.  Won't be able to continue to use it."
54,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,"I use this every other hair wash in between shampoo days. I gently scrub it into my scalp all around and work it through to my tips like a shampoo, and then clip up my hair and leave it in like a conditioner before washing it out at the end of my shower. It makes my hair look clean without making it dry and removes the old product. Perfect for curly hair! My hair looks very healthy once dry.This has more of a spiced cake smell than lemon, just so you know."
55,"Cake Beauty The Soft Serve Cream Rinse Conditioner, 10 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This conditioner is the best ever! I have long thick dry wavy hair and buy many different conditioners. This is by far my favourite. It makes your hair shine and full of body but not weighed down. Love it!!!

1,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for dry scalp...,"I was so excited for this shampoo. After years of no-poo or baby shampoo, I decided I wanted some actual volume to my hair and looked to this. It was affordable, has a great scent, and raving reviews. And I do like it! However, this is not great for my dry scalp (not dandruff). My scalp is so irritated and dry from using this unfortunately and so the volume boost I get is marred by large flakes of dry scalp... it was good while it lasted though!"
2,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Adds volume and shine,Love this product!. My hair has become thin and lifeless due to aging and thyroid issues.. The shampoo does exactly what is promised. I have since added the conditioner and styling foam to my regime and I'm recommending it to all my friends!
3,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,"Hair does no feel thicker, Gives me no extra volume, actually makes my hair look greasy next day. Not worth $7.99"

6,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the product, not so much the scent.","I absolutely love how it made each strand feel thicker. The scent was so-so. I liked it at first, then using it again it was uber sweet scented.  But as I said it worked on the thickness of my hair. I love that. So I will use it anyway."
7,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Probably a fake,I was given a fake product. I had bought the normally shampoo in the store before and the bottle was completely different than it and different from the picture.

8,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good!,"This shampoo is pretty good and smells so nice! It smells kind of like carrot cake. It‚Äôs a non-clear formula so I was expecting limp, overly moisturized hair, but it didn‚Äôt happen!"

Well, one star for fragrance - it smells nice. Unfortunately it left my hair very flat yet somehow flyaway... absolutely the worst shampoo experience ever. Even my son asked me, ""what'd you do with your hair?"" and he didn't mean it in a good way. The companion conditioner is no better.  I used it four times then tossed it."
40,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst I have ever used,"I am 36 and used a ton of shampoos and conditioners and let me say this is by far the worst. I bought the shampoo and conditioner because of the smell.  Tried it twice to make sure and my hair has never felt or looked worse.  Hard to detangle and looks dull, flat, and greasy right after using and drying.  My hair is harder to run a brush through, and looks worse the second day.  I don‚Äôt write reviews often but if I can help anyone with their hair, DON‚ÄôT buy!"
41,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't thoroughly clean my hair,"My hair isn't typically the kind to get greasy the day after I shower, usually I can get by 3-4 days without it looking greasy. I gave this shampoo 3 shots and I just don't like it. (For context, I have thick, wavy hair) Also, the scent sucks lol. I understand they are trying to make it smell like cake but it's pretty gross."

56,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,I have such a love hate with cake products.,"I bought the heavy cream body wash and I LOVE it. Best body wash ever. Smells incredible. So non drying. Just the best. So it made me explore other cake products.I have very fine hair and thanks to anemia not much of it. It‚Äôs weighed down easily and I‚Äôm always getting volumizing hair products. Too much conditioning weighs me down.Okay first we‚Äôll start with the bad.This smells awful.I have no idea where people get Carrot cake from. This shampoo like many other cake products smells like plastic or burnt plastic to me. Idk what it is. It has a sweet sugary smell then boom. Plastic. The hand cream smells the same to me. It‚Äôs not cake. It‚Äôs a sweet chemical smell.But I used it anyways. Try it.Brushing wet with a detangler brush it was a bit harder than usual ro comb through. This is def a light conditioner which I expected for volumizing and most volumizing shampoos will do this to my hair. Wasnd horrible. Just harder than usual.And once my hair dried it was in perfect shape. Shiny. My waves were nice and frizz free. I really love how this made my hair look. Bouncy. Nor heavy. It worked well for my hair.Luckily the smell didn‚Äôt stay in my hair. Just a very very faint sweet smell.I‚Äôm torn. Because the smell is that bad to me. Idk if I will buy it again, but it does make my hair look and feel great.Wish they would change thier smells."

58,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,Up until this shampoo I've loved every Cake product but this shampoo made my hair feel TERRIBLE!In under 12 hours my hair looked greasy and felt like I had left it unwashed with hair spray in it for days. I had to start using dry shampoo midway through the day.And this is without using any other products in my hair!Awful. I've given up on using it.
59,"Cake Beauty The Big Big Deal Thickening Volume Shampoo, 10 Ounces",Verified Purchase,Report abuse,This didn't work for my hair.  Weighs my hair down making it seem flatter and not thicker.

0,"Cake Beauty The Big Wig Thickening Volume Conditioner, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't smell as good as others let on.,"This is hands down the worst smelling conditioner I have ever used. All the curly hair group rave about it smelling so nice, so I treated myself to the conditioner and mousse. I used the conditioner first and did not care for the scent at all. The next day I used the mousse and it actually smelled pleasant, like lemon meringue. So then I thought my nose must have been crazy when it came to the conditioner so I tried it again (as I believe they are supposed to smell the same?) This time it gave me an instant migraine and made me nauseous. I had to recondition my hair with another product just so I wouldn't smell it on myself. I then threw it away. This is honestly the first time a hair product has ever made me physically ill."

11,"Cake Beauty The Big Wig Thickening Volume Conditioner, 10 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,No.,It doesn‚Äôt smell good & there is so much alcohol in the ingredient list. I used once and my hair is extremely dry! I‚Äôve used 2 different masks and my ends still feel horrible! Returning.
12,"Cake Beauty The Big Wig Thickening Volume Conditioner, 10 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Salon Quality,The smell and packaging are nice but the plethora of suds made me wonder about harsh detergents. I used both conditioner and shampoo for over 6 weeks because it is affordable but saw no positive results. I guess I have to go back to the pricier products like Kevin Murphy and Alterna Caviar.
13,"Cake Beauty The Big Wig Thickening Volume Conditioner, 10 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,What went wrong?,"I've been using this for over 6 months. The last bottle I just bought smells like rancid plastic. It still works, but I can't stand the smell at all. I'm not buying this anymore."

0,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for fine hair,I really wanted to love this product because i love cake beauty but it left my hair weighed down and greasy looking. The smell is amazing and it might work a lot better for someone with thick hair but even a tiny squirt in my hands and just applied to the ends of my hair didnt work for me.
1,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth The Price,"The scent is okay & it works okay on my hair. Nothing special. It arrived leaking out a bit but nothing serious. I pictured the bottle being a bit bigger in my head but when I look back at the product pictures that's nobody's fault but mine. The product is eh at most. I don't think it's worth the price. It's small & I personally believe you can find something better for a cheaper price that does the same exact thing. The bottle fits in my hands,  & believe me, I have some small hands. The part of the bottle where all the liquid is is the exact same size as my hand not counting the lil spray nozzle part. I only bought this because I previously bought another product from them called ""The Curl Friend"" and loved it. This product says ""totally to die for"" on the back of bottle and my funeral still hasn't begun sooo. All in all, simply put, this product is alright. It's not worth the hype."

(if that makes sense?) it leaves a residue in your hair that collects dust and dirt all day. So by the end of the day your hair feels really dirty. I would have to wash my hair before going to bed, because my hair would feel gross. I'm sorry, but It's not worth it."

Living in the high desert, with hard water, my hair gets very dry and rough. I have tried more expensive products. But why buy them!?!? This stuff conditions my hair and keeps it soft and silky!!! Even my hairdresser comments on the softness. Plus, it smells so good you want to eat it! :)"
6,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells delicious,"I love the smell of the CAKE products. This one is especially potent, since it's a leave-in conditioner.I believe it also works! And have gotten compliments on the the shine it brings to my hair.My only complaint is the portion is so small that I go through a bottle pretty quickly if I use it every other day.So that makes it pretty pricey.  Note: I'm still buying it!"
7,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Ultimate softness,I used to use Bedhead Afterparty to tame my thick wavy long mane but this it so much better! The after party was very heavy with silicone and made parts of my hair look greasy. This tames frizz without the weight of oils
8,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Less is more,"I have long, fine hair and I learned less is more with this.  Spray the tiniest amount in your hand, then work through the ends.  Great for second and third day refreshes.  A little goes a long way.  When used sparingly,  it'll take frizz and moisturize like a pro"

14,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Overwhelming scent,"The scent smells good but it can be overwhelming and cause headaches if you are sensitive to it. The product itself does help soften the hair, but I noticed that if I sleep on hair I‚Äôve applied leave-in conditioner to, I wake up w tangled straw hair. For reference I have thick black hair with slightly wavy strands."

60,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt believe ‚Äúnot for fine hair‚Äù reviews,"When I bought this product I was fully expecting to try it and be disappointed and then trash it after holding on to it for months and never using it, just like every other leave in I‚Äôve ever bought. But I was shocked by the results. Finally less frizz and doesn‚Äôt leave me feeling greasy. I have super fine hair that is hard to keep from getting greasy. All of the reviews that I‚Äôve read saying ‚Äúnot for fine hair‚Äù don‚Äôt make sense to me. Use an appropriate amount (and don‚Äôt use on your roots) and you won‚Äôt be weighed down or greasy."
61,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for damaged hair!,"So i bought this product because i have very damaged hair from over processing and i have been growing out my hair for the past year. I used to use pantene with the aussie 3 min miracle deep conditioner and on top of that i used the 7 seconds brand leavin in conditioner and it was great i loved it. BUT THEN i found this product and it is amazing! Light scent, super hydrating and its mends my split ends ! I stopped using both my deep conditioner and my leave in conditioner and now all i do is shampoo and apply this product to my split ends and it does an amazing job at keeping my hair soft, shiny, and looking healthier! Would definitely recommend!As a side note, use less not more, as it made my hair a little greasy too fast if i used a lot. 9/10 rating"
62,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Oribe...,"I have very long and very thick hair. When I began the process of growing my hair to get to where it is I came across an issue that I have never experienced, tangled hair which looks crazy in the morning and can be somewhat painful to detangle. I went online and searched for the ""best"" detangle and leave in conditioner. So of course I came across Oribe. I tried it, it smelled amazing but it left my hair feeling oily and greasy and PLEASE do not get me started on the price. I was super bummed that I spent so much on this hyped product. One day at Ult I stumbled upon Cake Beauty Mane  the packaging caught my eye and the price! After the first use I was hooked, I needed just a few sprays and it detangled with ease. I am hooked! I will never buy or use any other product this is such a game changer."
63,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Soft hair result,"I have to respectfully disagree with Molly. I love the body lotion - which does smell delicious. As for this specific product, it worked great and left my wickedly curly hair, extremely soft. I actually did not notice how it smelled, but used it so much I went back out to buy it again."
64,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dry/breakage,First thing i got was the hair mask and because i loved it i went ahead and got the leave in. First 2 weeks was amazing after that i started noticing my hair frizz up and breaking so much. It sucks because the products were leaving my curls looking nice but once i took the product out it was super dry and it would break easily .
65,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE it!!,I have very long extremely thick hair. This is the best leave in I've tried so far!! Love love LOVE it!
66,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,In love,I have thick curly hair. This stuff is great for detangling. This is definitely something i would suggest for kids with thick curly hair. This stuff leave my hair feeling SOOOOO SOFT!
67,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Don't like,For me it sprays out in small globs of conditioner in random spots and leaves an uneven greasy look after brushing. It does smell good though.
68,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,A game changer...i finally found the best leave in...tames my frizzy hair to a soft light weight shine ...better styling too...a little is all you need ...it's amazing and brought my hair back to life
69,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing products plus amazing scent,Cake Beauty products are amazing! I tried a popular big brand & it dried my hair out so bad. Will stick with Cake for now on.
70,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hair product ever,This product is truly amazing
71,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad dispenser,"Product is great but after using few times, it wouldn‚Äôt dispense anything in my hand even after shaking well."
72,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dried out my hair and made it more frizzy and smells too strong,This was quite a disappointment as it did the opposite of what it was supposed to do. I have coarse hair that tends to be frizzy especially as my Japanese straightening grew out more than six months ago so products are even more important. This not only had way too strong of a scent--it also made my hair extra dry with almost a straw look plus I had to deal with the strong smell that is kind of a mix between chemical and candy and not something nice to have so close to the nose. I'm glad it works for some people based on the reviews though definitely wish I hadn't bought it.
73,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smooth those curls!,I love this line of hair products. The smell is incredible. This product gives my curls a smooth look.

76,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Soft silky hair,Smells yummy and makes my hair so soft
77,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,Price and how it works,I like this brand due to having thick curly hair.
78,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this stuff!,"Moisturizes, removes knots, smells and feels great. Love it."
79,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"I love this conditioner as it makes my hair so soft with no stickiness at all, however much you use.  I've been using it for over a year now and dread the day they stop making it.I have the kind of thick, naturally slightly wavy, fair hair that only needs a tiny bit of moisture in the air and it turns to a massive frizz ball and feels really coarse and dry/tangled.  It's got worse over the years as now I have some added coarse grey hairs so I have to use colour too, leaving it even more susceptible to frizziness.  This conditioner works miracles!  My hair just feels so soft, silky and more manageable.  I use conditioner after shampooing and then use this after towel drying.  I spray about 10 times onto and into my (bit longer than) shoulder-length hair, from top to bottom (including the top to keep the frizzy bits flattened), and then run my fingers through it to spread, leaving it soft and silky.  (You'd probably need to use a fair bit less if you don't have such thick hair.)  The smell is sweet and pleasant but I only really notice it when I'm applying as it doesn't seem to linger.I can't believe how cheap this product is for the result it achieves... I only wish they'd made it when I was a teenager as it would've saved me many shed tears over my often frizzy hair lol!I'm waiting for my first order of Cake Posh Soft Serve conditioner to arrive now, having tried The Curl Friend for the first time today and being as happy with it as I'd hoped.  Now all I need is for Amazon to restock the shampoo so I can give that a go too!  I doubt I'll be disappointed by anything from this brand as, from my experience to date, it's the best I've ever come across for my hair so please never stop selling it, Amazon! :)"
80,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Not sure really how to describe this product. My hair is over processed, dry and brittle at the ends and not in good condition. I put this on and my hair is soft and manageable and has a fabulous shine. If it was a choice between saving my husband or my cake the mane from falling overboard. Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs a good job he can swim:)"
81,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Only need a small amount lovely an soft great fragrance suited my hair

83,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),"Absolutely love this product! After bleaching and dyeing my hair..it was somewhat damaged. This stuff saved my hair from a ton of breakage and leaves it so smooth and soft! The scent is amazing, like fresh baked cake with cinnamon, vanilla and a hint of banana but super light. Hair stays smelling fresh all day long."
84,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,So for starters I really like the smell of this stuff. It is really sweet but it‚Äôs called cake so what else would you expect? However I was super bummed to find it shipped to me & had leaked :( I read a few other reviews having this same issue before ordering but decided to try it anyways. Missing 1/4 of the bottle is a huge disappointment when paying for something :(

  ¬†NOZZLES DO NOT WORK - ALL 3 THAT I HAVE BOUGHT WERE DEFECTIVE. STAY AWAY."
86,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"First time using this. It smells amazing. Like actual desserts. Not sickly sweet or over fragranced. I have long hair. My ends tend to dry out and my lengths tangle. This is a great after shower detangler, seems to add moisture. Helps get ready for styling. My only minor complaint is this feels like watered down conditioner at times. I mean truthfully that pretty much what these products are. But i have sprayed it on my dry ends. A few days later. When my hair is dry and needs moisture. It coats the hair. I loose the conditioned look. Its a great detangler and style prepper. But not a great after style remoisturizer/smoother. Perhaps i should use another product for that like an oil. As i said i like this and its a mild negative."
87,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Love the brand , this makes my hair feel/smell great and that it‚Äôs cruelty free , amazing.  But the pump design is way off. I tried it because you should just be able to spray product into hair . But pump is too small to suck up any product at all . So every time you use it you have to unscrew the pump and dump into your hand . Is it The end of the world?  - no. But just don‚Äôt sell it as a spray product , put something on bottle that is easier to use ."
88,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"I was excited to try this but the smell is so awful, I literally can't bring myself to use it. It smells like something you'd spray in the bathroom to cover up a dump, it's truly repulsive. Also, one single spray made my hair super greasy."
89,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I have fine hair that is a nightmare to detangle since childhood. Plus a scalp that tends to be oily with dry ends. So finally i have found this product that i use after using the shampoo from the same brand. This conditionner makes my hair easy to detangle and soft. Plus the smell is fantastic. Unlike other conditionner my hair stays clean and my scalp not oily for days. Great product !
90,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Has a very sweet smell almost like a candy I had when I was a kid. Not sure if it really helps my hair at all, I‚Äôve been using it two months and haven‚Äôt noticed a difference positive or negative. I do like the ethics behind the company though"
91,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,J'adore ce produit.  Pour les cheveux boucler seulement.

I have very damaged hair and this stuff makes my hair feel soft for days! I find it works well to spray the product in my hand and then distribute from the ends first. The scent isn‚Äôt too overpowering which I appreciate."

95,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"This leave in conditioner is thick and creamy. It makes your hair feel wonderful. It smells like spice cake with vanilla icing or eggnog. I love it. The only thing is, the bottle is a little small."
96,"Cake Beauty Mane Manager 3-in-1 Leave In Conditioner, 4 Ounces",Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I find this makes your hair have a clingy texture even when fully dry and styled. I have so many knots in my hair throughout the day when I use this product. Only benefit is the scent.

7,"Cake Beauty The Gloss Boss Dry Styling Oil, 4 Ounces",1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap 2 dollar hoo-uh.,"This is the absolute worst thing I've ever put in my freaking hair. I have smelled like a cheap candle for hours. I can't get away from the smell. I got the ""real"" stuff and it literally has the smell of the cheapest vanilla candle in the dollar store, mixed with carpet deodorizer. Or a car air freshener. If you're tempted to buy this, believe me, this is not pleasant. It is overpowering and every time you breathe in you can smell it. I can't believe ppl buy this.  I'm mid-40s and I'm actually angry that I cannot get the smell off me until I take a shower. As for the shine? Sure, you spray it on after having washed your hair yesterday, to freshen it up. And it sparkles. But not in a good way. It's like squinting cooking oil on your hair. It clumps your hair together and adds a layer of grease on top. Not shine. Grease. It literary looks like I haven't washed my hair in a year. Don't buy this crap. And if you did, and you hate it as much as I do, for the love of Christmas, SEND IT BACK & get your money back. I'm so tired of garbage being sold to us year after year. There's literally no quality anymore unless you pay 100x fair value. I returned 4 other Cake products just because the smell of this is so offensive, they don't deserve my business."

A good, cheap alternative to an extender like Living Proof. I've been using this Cake Thick Trick foam for over a year and have come to rely on it as my primary hair product.My Hair: Dark blond, thick hair, of a medium weight (not particularly fine). I don't have a lot of curl to my hair but it's naturally a bit wavy. Shoulder length.For me, using this this Cake foam on wet hair extends the longevity of my hairstyle, helping it last 1-2 days longer between washes. It doesn't do a ton for my curliness (which needs a lot of help to really show up), but it helps my hair maintain volume and seems to reduce oil buildup, so my hair feels clean for longer. I didn't use to air dry my hair often because I got a lot more volume out of a blow-dry, but with this product, air drying works pretty well too.If I really want a lot of curl, I put this Cake foam on the roots of my hair, and a more intense curl-defining mouse on the ends, and air dry.I'm not in love with the scent but it's not overpowering. A bit between a birthday cake scent and an artificial cherry scent, I think. I don't mind it. It's kind of unique. I like the foam formulation because its easy to apply throughout my hair.I got some for my brother with much curlier, short hair, and he likes it too. It seems to help his soft curls mostly through lifting the volume. It's not extremely defining but helps support soft, loose curliness."

I have fine but thick hair. I was looking for a styling product that gives it volume and bounce. Using as directed, it left my hair looking flat and lifeless. Even my son asked me what happened to my hair (and not in a good way). I am very frustrated I wasted good money on this."

Its very moisturizing and has incredible slip. This foam i think is made for those who have a more coily texture or tighter curl pattern. Definitely not for those who have a loser curl pattern. I am not into curl pattern number system but you can say i have type 3c/4a hair. It also has a medium hold which is perfect for the fall/winter season. I did pair it up with marc anthony coconut and shea styling cream. That cream is the best for my hair. It probably was this combo that gave me a bomb wash and go.

28,"Cake Beauty Thick Trick Volumizing Styling Foam Hair Mousse, Green Tea & Ginseng for Volume & Shine, Vegan for Women, Sulfate, Paraben & Cruelty Free, Basic, 6.8 Oz, basic (MA00268)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for volume,"I tried Cake curl mousse after seeing so many rave reviews and love it, so I thought I'd try this as well. For reference, I have fine, wavy hair cut in an A-line bob that I usually blow dry straight. Redken thickening lotion is my go-to for volume, but I wanted to try something new as well.This product has what I'd call a watery foam consistency. The label says to use a quarter sized amount, and I've found with my other Cake product that a little goes a long way with this brand. While the curl mousse has a delicious lemon frosting scent, this has more of a spice cake scent. I'm sensitive to strong smells, but it's not irritating to me.As for how well the product works? I love it! I apply the product, comb it through my hair, and blow dry with a round brush. I get noticeable volume, shine, and my hair never feels stiff or sticky, as with some volumizing products. I love that I don't have to use much product, either, so a bottle should last for a long time.Overall, I'm super impressed with this volumizing product and would definitely recommend it. I know finding and trying new hair products can be frustrating because different people will get different results, but hopefully my long-winded review helps someone choose."

0,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",4.0 out of 5 stars,Work well for me.,"It appears that others have had a different experience but these work really well for me. They sponge up the grease in my hair without leaving a lot of powdery residue, something I hate about all-natural dry shampoos. I used to use similar sheets for my face and these are just a larger, thicker version. I don't want to use the highly chemical aerosol dry shampoos and I don't like the messy, powder ones that you have to shake into your hair and avoid overdoing. This is easy to use, very portable, and works for my hair."
1,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",5.0 out of 5 stars,Effective and covenient,"I am surprised at some of the reviews, I love these, I looked them up on here because I like them so much. They fit nice and flat in my purse and work well on my hair"
2,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless thin junk.,"So thin they fall apart in seconds. Weird idea, seems kinda cool and discreet at first but absolutely fails to be useful. Would love a refund. Would give 5 stars if I could get a refund."
3,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,This product does not work. I have given it multiple tries and it ends up making my hair look greasier than before I used it.
4,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",1.0 out of 5 stars,Dislike,Didn't work. Didn't like patting my head. Not worth the money.
5,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves pink flakes in hair.,Didn't really work very well at absorbing oil/greasiness. The sheets also left pink flakes in my hair.
6,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt work,I had high hopes for this but it simply just doesn‚Äôt work.
7,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",5.0 out of 5 stars,These things work great!,"I'm surprised at the other reviews for these sheets. I was actually coming here to buy more. I received some as a Christmas gift -- I had been using baby powder, but I disliked how it stayed in my hair and really ended up weighing it down more in the end. These sheets are awesome! All you have to do is part your hair in various places all over your head and just kind of rub the pink side of the paper on the hair on each side of the part. You'll immediately see the oil coming off onto the paper. One sheet is plenty for one average sized head. :-) I'm amazed at how much cleaner my hair looks, and it easily allows me to make it through that day between hair washings when you feel like your hair looks a little too dirty.... One note - there is another similar product referenced as dry shampoo blotting sheets on Amazon that I haven't tried yet that looks less expensive. I might give that a test to see how it compares."
8,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",1.0 out of 5 stars,Would not recommend to a friend,"This product felt waxy, was awful to apply, and turned my scalp at hairline pink. Not to mention my platinum blonde hair was tinted pink all day. Would not recommend to a friend."
9,"Cake Beauty The Take Out Dry Shampoo, 20 Blotting Sheets",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth $$,Good idea but does not work as advertised. Far too expensive when a much cheaper dry shampoo spray is equal or better.

0,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sweet Delicious scent!!!,"Ok everyone I have pin pointed the scent EXACTLY!  As I took my first wiff, I knew I smelled this in my own home before but I could not identify it. I could pick up a hint of vanilla, and some spice but I still couldn‚Äôt place the spice. Then I picked up on a hint of cinnamon.  Then I got it!  It‚Äôs chai latte exactly!!!  I‚Äôm not a vanilla fan but I LOVE this scent. I cannot say anything else since I won‚Äôt be using it for awhile.  But the bottle is small for the price.  And for those who complain about the bottle not full, mine arrived full since shipping caused pressure inside the bottle that the manufacturer must allow for. No complaint there. I decided to enjoy a chai latte drink after opening and smelling my shipment!"
1,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",4.0 out of 5 stars,A difference from Deva Curl,"I would have given this product 5 stars but contents had somehow oozed out during shipment.I am a long time Deva curl user and I can say that this product is a great alternative for my curl type (3b). The smell is rich while using, but is not strong when dry. It does not make my hair feel saturated with chemicals."
2,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Obsessed,I discovered Cake products in a pinch and walked into Walgreens.  I instantly fell in love!  I love the smell and consistency of the products.  I love cowashes.  I have combination hair that's wavy/curly and cowashes work best for me - plus it's 1 less product to use.  This stuff left my hair smelling and feeling amazing!  I generally wash my hair every other day and I noticed with this cowash - my hair didn't feel dirty or weighed down after the second day - which leads me to believe it cleanse & nourishes my scalp and hair really well. Definitely going to be using this on the regular.  Package arrived loose so it was a little messy.
3,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,Less than half full?,"I don‚Äôt have a problem with the product itself other than the fact that the scent doesn‚Äôt really smell like ‚ÄúCake.‚Äù The products always seem to have a strong Coconut oil smell to them which I‚Äôm not a huge fan of. This time however, I was more displeased with the fact that my bottle was only half filled. Probably even less than half. It‚Äôs hard to get a good picture of this but trust me, it was pretty low down there. How could this even happen? There were no leaks in the packaging. The mess on top was done by me when I took the pump off."
4,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,Stinks,"First off, the bottle arrived partially open and spilling out all over the inside of the box- not a slight against Cake obviously, but amazon‚Äôs handling of the product. Second, I‚Äôm wondering if I got a bad batch or if this product always smells like cheap rubber. When I first opened the box, I was like ‚Äúoh yeah, there it is. It smells like dessert.‚Äù Then I got it out of the bottle in the shower and changed my mind and decided that it just kinda smelled like really artificial candy. After I got it into my hair, the smell somehow morphed into cheap shoe rubber or tires or something. NOT good, luckily I have strong-smelling, Jasmine scented conditioner I applied afterwards. I‚Äôm certainly second guessing myself now about wanting to buy the curl whip, about which I‚Äôve mostly heard rave reviews."
5,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked fine as a cleansing conditioner, but oh, the smell!","I‚Äôve tried many many cleansing conditioners for my long, wavy/curly hair. I have a moisturizer by the same company that I really, really like so I thought I‚Äôd give this a try. It worked fairly well and it didn‚Äôt weigh my hair down. After rinsing with cool water, then using a citric acid rinse, then adding just a little bit of the conditioner back to the ends, my hair was CURLY when it dried.But the smell‚Ä¶ I just really dislike it! It smells like a STRONG vanilla Yankee candle, or other vanilla over-scented candle. It‚Äôs waxy, a bit chemical, and overpoweringly cheap vanilla. You might like it; my 19 year old daughter said it reminded her of the way 5 Below smells and she liked it, lol. So I gave it to her and will move on. It just wasn‚Äôt for me.I ordered two bottles, and one was leaking upon arrival, so believe the reviews that talk about that too. Amazon had both bottles individually wrapped in leak-proof bags so they must be aware of it by now."
6,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, pleasant smell, could be a bit more moisturizing","I really like Cake beauty products. This cleansing conditioner is what I hoped for. Very pleasant smell. Nice consistency and easy to use. I used quite a few cleansing conditioners in the past and this one is almost my favorite.I took a one star off, because i feel like it is moisturizing, but not enough.Still a very good product."
7,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,It was all wrong,"I wanted to love it so much. I saved it as a pick me up on a bad day. first pup it smelled so sweet, then I started putting it in my hair‚Ä¶ it smelled off some how. Okay my life like I‚Äôm betting someone of yours has been, well hard. I had not taken a shower in let‚Äôs go with a day. (To be kind) then my husband, and kids started talking about how bad it smelled. Especially on the hair. (They get to shower, so it was not just my stinky hair)Now all of that can be forgiven if it works well. I mean Instagram can‚Äôt smell me. But no. No I can not have nice things. I will say that my hair is long, like madden in a flower Field long. This shit gave me the worst split ends‚Ä¶ and I use suave. I had just cut my hair. Having it tucked into my pants is not always the look I‚Äôm going for, but after this I had to cut my hair even more‚Ä¶ they are going to kick me out of the flower Field if I keep using this.So I guess in short take a pass on this one. Oh, and have a good day"
8,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!!!! But made adjustments...,"This makes my hair feel so soft! I have very thick hair with curly waves that is very frizz prone. I have a difficult time finding products that can make my hair feel soft. I will say that I tried it as just the cleansing conditioner & it did not 'cleanse' enough for me & my hair looked oily after 1 day. So the next time, I put some shampoo only on my roots & rinsed before applying this to all of my hair and it has turned out amazing!!! Will be purchasing this again!!! The smell is good, but could use some small adjustments IMO."
9,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best conditioning shampoo ever,I absolutely love this conditioner and shampoo all in one no more greesey hair and less Hair falls out in shower
10,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible smell. Triggers my migraines,"I don't know what is wrong with the shampoo and conditioner, but they smell HORRIBLE! Not sweet at all.I do love the conditioner helps takes the tangles out. The shampoo makes my hair look and feel fresh for days.It's the SMELL that makes me hesitate reordering.All I can think to describe the smell is pepper. Like pepper was dumped in every bottle.I'm not the only one mentioning this issue, so hope the company works on that.The smell lingers on my hair even when dry üò≠üò≠üò≠üòØüòØüòØ"
11,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product for naturally curly hair,"I have thick, naturally curly hair and have always struggled with controlling frizz and poofiness.  This product is a godsend and has done what no other conditioner or cleansing balm has ever been able to do. It always leaves my hair soft and smooth, and controls the volume.  It smells like a cinnamon roll, almost good enough to eat!  It washes out cleanly and doesn‚Äôt leave fragrance in my hair though.  Several of the other reviews mentioned that this product leaked out of the bottle during shipment, but mine were both intact with no spill.  The pumps/nozzles were secured in place with tape and they were sealed in plastic bags, so I‚Äôm guessing there have been improvements in packaging.  Love this cleansing conditioner and will keep buying it as long as Cake makes it."
12,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,The worst smelling product for hair that I've ever used.,"I just got this today and was so excited to try this. I am always looking for a good cleansing conditioner to use in place of washing a few days a week. It is a typical cleansing conditioner, no suds but the smell is the most disgusting things I've ever smelled. It literally smells like a burnt rubber band. I had to get back in the shower and wash my hair with shampoo and use conditioner because the smell was so bad it was making me nauseated. I threw it directly into the trash."
13,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,I threw it in the trash after 3 uses,"I was really hopeful for this product,  the smell is very sweet to the point it is overwhelming, but what I am most disappointed in is the actual performance of the product itself. It left my hair feeling grimey and sticky even after a thorough scrubbing scalp to ends and rinse. It reminded me of when you get the grimey build-up from not having a water softener for a long period of time."
14,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,Middle of the road overall but a good value for cleansing conditioner,"Don't expect to feel particularly clean if you use this on you hair, and don't expect to think the scent is that pleasant. It requires more pumps than I would like in order to cover my head, and the scent lingers until my hair is dry which is a big mark-down for me. It's an odd scent, sweet though not like anything recognizable. Softening is nowhere near as good as Keracolor but then again this costs ~ $8 and Kera costs ~ $22."
15,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this stuff!,"I use this during the week because my stylist said to shampoo only once weekly.  This cleans my hair, makes it soft and I love the scent!  For reference, I have somewhat thick, wavy hair.  My only complaint was that the bottles leaked all over during shipment.  Customer service was great though and made it right."
16,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd be in love, if only it didn't smell awful.","It's a good cleanser, a great moisturizer, and I love the way it leaves my hair soft and curly. If only I could stand the aroma. I don't know who thought eucalyptus bubble gum was a great idea for a fragrance, but it ruins the product for me. The scent lingers I'm my hair for the next 24-36 hours as well. I roll over at night and get a face full of candied menthol. I won't be purchasing it again."
17,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of moisture but sickening sweet scent,"This provides plenty of moisture for my curls in between my weekly shampooing, but the the scent is way too overpowering. It is a sickening sweet scent. I have used other Cake hair products before and none had this strong of a scent to them. It is sort of a cross between bubblegum and birthday cake x 100!!! If you like that sort of thing, then you might love this, I will not be ordering this again though."
18,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells wonderful!!! Works great for thick and curly hair!,Bought this for my little girl she had thick and curly hair and it really helps to detail her hair and the smell is wonderfully delicious!
19,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Me likey!,"Smells like spice cake - maybe less sweet.  Nice consistency and leaves my hair soft.  About the size of a soda, but I only wash once a week sooooooo...  Two paws up! üòÅ"
20,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle not full,"I really like the product.  It's hard to find reasonably priced cleansing conditioners.  I thought I would try this one.  The bottle was not damaged, so I know it didn't leak.  But the bottle was not full.  I notice other reviews saying the same thing.  Really odd...so buy with caution."
21,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle exploded,"Contents exploded out of bottle as was previously stated in so many other reviews. Package and delivery was fine, but there‚Äôs something weird baking in the bottle."
22,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Left my fine hair feeling gross!,"I read some reviews prior to purchasing and honestly thought I could get past the smell - NOPE! But thats not even the worst part, I tried this twice and did an extra rinse the 2nd time but it still felt like it was just sitting on my head all day. Do Not RecommendBottle arrived full and unopened."
23,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,Heavily scented,"Great price and I wanted to try some ""different"" brands of cleansing conditioner.  Very heavy scent.  As a cleansing conditioner ""weighty"" but not moisturizing.  Glad to try but I won't repurchase."
24,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh üòë,"The scent is pretty bad. Kind of like wet cardboard. For the price, I would go for a different brand..... it doesn‚Äôt work that well, hair doesn‚Äôt feel clean or light afterwards and I feel like I need to use A LOT to get any kind of  cleansing affect."
25,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,Won't buy again,"The package arrived intact, the smell was nice,  kinda like bubble gum it went through my hair nicely but the end result was strange, my hair was oily but dried out.  I had to put 4 drops of lanza healing oil to calm it down.  Sorry, not for me"
26,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Please listen to the reviews.,This smells so so bad I will never even use it.Smells like burnt plastic and mint. Or cough medicine.It‚Äôs truly disgusting. Believe the reviews.
27,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy!,"I read quite a few reviews about products from this brand drying your hair out, and I definitely had the complete opposite problem with this product. My hair was so greasy from this after washing it two times with regular shampoo and it was still greasy I had to wash my hair with dish soap to get it out. After the bottle came opened and leaking all over the inside of the package. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
28,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible product,"This stuff was horrible. Instead of feeling moisturized.

29,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah, no.",This stuff is horrible. I don't know if it's the actual product or something else.

32,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,Love it but...,"I really like this product and how well it works, but both shippings came a mess (all spilled out). It is not a the products fault, it's the way that it's being sent by the seller."
33,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh god, the smell..","So let me describe the scent from my personal point of view: Imagine turning on your heater after a long time of not using it,  and then you light a sickly sweet-smelling candle to try and mask that odor...But hey, my hair looks pretty."
34,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells awful,"It smells like vanilla frosting that has gone bad.  The product cleans ok and doesn't leave my hair feeling oily, but I can't get past the scent."

79,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,I received a empty bottle with the product dryed up and spilled out
80,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product. Bad Packaging.,"I bought this at Walgreens just to try because it was on sale and ended up being quite upset when I got home and looked at it more closely. It does say 10 oz. on the packaging, but the bottle could actually hold twice that amount. For that reason, I only rated 4 stars instead of 5 because they are intentionally tricking us with that bigger bottle being only half full.I was hoping I would not like the product, but I ended up really liking this cleansing conditioner. I wish I could find it in a larger amount than the 10 oz. bottle though."
81,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Not heavy or greasy,"I use this on rotation with my regular shampoo and conditioner routine, and I can still curl and style my hair as normal after use.  I have color treated, fine, straight caucasian hair that can get oily with similar products and this is not overly heavy like some are."
82,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for everyone,"This formula didn‚Äôt work for me so I returned it. The problem is, it was buy one get one 50% off. Both were returned at the same time but the seller is trying to say I need to return one. Buyer beware. I will be be handling this with Amex."
83,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed. Should have known better.,"The bottle was opened. Lost half the product. The smell is awful. I haven‚Äôt used it yet but, I can already tell it isn‚Äôt the same as what I bought at Walgreens. I will not buy from Amazon again."
84,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Cleansing conditioner ever,"If you like cleansing conditioners , CAKE is hands down the best. I have used all kinds of cleansing products and this one is hands down my favorite. I love the smell and I use it daily."
85,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,left hair feeling disgusting,"hair feels greasy and dirty, smells bad and leaves residue in hair. other cleansing conditioners have worked just fine for me, this one was pretty bad"
86,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing!!,This stuff smells amazing and my daughter loves it. However when it came it was leaking and the pump did not work. I‚Äôm sure this was something to do with shipping. But just a heads up.
87,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great hair wash,The only issue I had was the bottle was not properly sealed during transit so some conditioner leaked out. I love the smell of this product and it really made my curls pop.
88,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Smells literally like cake. I love it.
89,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves hair feeling greasy,Product leaves build up and residue in your hair after I washed it repeatedly. Leaves hair feeling greasy. Not happy with it :(
90,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Allergy warning,Possibly allergic to this product cause a lot of irritation to scalp
91,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",5.0 out of 5 stars,CLEANSING CONDITIONER,This product is great! My hair soft and doesn't frizz.
92,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as bad as I expected,"After reading so many negative reviews of this product, I was expecting a horrible smell and my hair either feeling like I had slathered lard on it or left it straw dry. I didn't experience any of these things. The smell isn't great, but it doesn't smell anything like burnt rubber, as several other users have said. As a matter of fact, I really have only 2 complaints about this product. First, as many others have complained, the bottle I received was nowhere near full. It was 3/4 full at best, and not even really that full. And the bottle wasn't open, so it seems like QA isn't paying attention to how full the bottle are before they're sent out. Second is that this product is very watery. Other comparable products I have tried are much thicker, more like a cream. I found that even more disappointing than the amount of product I received."
93,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",1.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my hair dry,The smell was just ok
94,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",3.0 out of 5 stars,The scent is...odd.,"The scent is very chemically and sweet, but when washed out it just smells vaguely sweet so not bad. It is very moisturizing and does a good job of cleansing without leaving your hair too oily."
95,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",TOP 100 REVIEWER,Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),"Got it in mid Nov, just finished the bottle today in the beginning of Jan.  I used it pretty much everyday, just occasionally three four times with regular shampoo, so a bottle lasts about 1.5 month for close to everyday use (I have shoulder length,  dark brown asian hair).I have been looking for a Wen substitute, and I think so far this one is quite close.  It is runnier than Wen (which is a cream), but while I need to pump 10-15 times with Wen, I just need maybe 5 or 6 pumps.  I rub with my hands then spread on hair, then comb through to distribute evenly.  Leave on hair for about 5 mins then rinse (bottle says do not over rinse).  I think the trick is to figure out how much is enough and don't overdo it.  The bottle says a ""dollop"" which is rather up to your imagination.  So you'll need some trial n error.I thought it is an ok product, until last week, I dyed my hair and it fried my hair, making it looked like hay stacks.  I used this two days in a row, and my hair is looking soft, moisturized, and shiny, even better than before.  It is amazing.The smell though.  Cake Beauty products are usually sweet and yummy.  My nose tells me it smells like cream of mushroom soup with cinnamon?!  lol  It's not offensive, just not what you expect from a hair product.Also I find it a bit expensive for 10oz.  I will definitely buy again, stock up if it is on sale."
96,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"It di not bode well the moment it arrived leaking over the rest of my order (bottle does not seal well). Gave it a try. leaves nothing but a gross residue in the hair.This is not my first cleansing conditioner, my hair responds well to pretty much all formulas meant for thick hair usually (I have 2A hair that thrives with the b&b invisible oil line and shea moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo& conditioner).But this just made it an oil slick/ block from root to tip.fine, med and thick-haired guys, gals, and non-binary pals. It is not worth it."
97,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Reading other reviews, I was apprehensive. The good reviews left me hopeful. But unfortunately the bad reviews seemed to be accurate. Used it tonight and my hair is heavy and feels greasy. I rinsed the product from my hair thoroughly,  yet that still left a heavy film in my hair. I'll try it a few more times. But I'm not hopeful. The smell is more pleasant in the bottle and does have a burnt marshmallow smell when in hair. But that's not a huge deal to me. It's the heavy film that's a no"
98,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Despite 2 thorough rinses this product stuck to my hair in a greasy mess. I finally had to wash it out and I'm still not convinced it's all gone. Maybe my hair is too curly/wavy for this product but I thought that co-wash was ideal for that hair type. The pink bottle made me think it would smell pretty too. Wrong. Had a weird burnt rubber scent. I hate to be so harsh in a revue but this product is really not very good.
99,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"I was a bit hesitant to try this product as I too, had been a WEN user for years, but was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.  Scent is a bit stronger than I'm used to, but not bad.  I found I didn't need to use too much, either.  Will reorder.One recommendation I would offer is, cap the bottle and include the pump on the side for shipping.  The drip gripper stopper just doesn't cut it.  There is going to be leakage."
100,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"I love buying from Canadian companies... And I love curly-friendly products. But this has silicone which isn't great for curls. Overall, it washes hair decently for an in-between wash. The scent is light and pleasant and not overpowering. Some people might be fine with the silicone so give it a try if you want. It's also cruelty-free, which is nice."
101,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"The product itself is fine, but it has such a fake, gross sweet candy smell that I don't want to use it and it confuses my 5yo daughter ""It kind smells like candy but it smells weird, too"". Yup.Kind of runnier than I'd like, need about 4 pumps for her small head. It does work well and leaves her hair feeling nice."
102,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,It works well for my daughter's difficult to manage curly hair. I find I need to use a lot of the product compared to regular shampoo and conditioner but worth it as her hair is so much better than before.
103,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Giving 5 stars because the product is amazing......but it exploded in transit so I had to return it.  Rather than a refund I reordered it and will see if the same thing happens.  It's almost like the lid is not on tight enough.  Fix the shipping and people would buy it.  4 days later new bottle came and it was perfect!!
104,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I love the product but both times getting it the cap was unscrewed and exploded in the box.
105,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I‚Äôve been using the Cake Brand since November and to say I‚Äôm impressed is an understatement. The suds free conditioner leaves my hair nice and soft as does the entire line I use. Definitely give it a try!
106,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"I really like this product... I have naturally curly and wavy hair; it helps reduce frizz and smells great!I ordered two bottles, one was leaking in the packaging; amazon sent a replacement... the replacement was also leaking. I did not notify Amazon of the replacement."
107,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Leaves my hair feeling clean without the build up which is what I wanted. I paid it with the cake shampoo scrub to remove buildup from other hair products that leave my hair greasy
108,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I've tried quite a few condition cleansing shampoos and this one has got to be the worst.My hair was thick with some kind of coating that dragged it down and felt less clean than before I used it.DO NOT BUY THIS
109,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I absolutely love this product. The fragrance is not overwhelming. Kind of reminds me of homemade custard. Makes my hair feel nice and soft. I will be buying this on a regular basis.
110,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"It does exactly what it's supposed to. Cleanses hair without stripping moisture, and leaves hair feeling smooth and healthy without frizz. The only thing I will complain about is that the scent is a bit like burnt rubber mixed with cookie batter. It smells strong in the shower but the smell won't linger on your hair after it's dried. If you can get past that, this product is awesome."
111,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"My hair has never felt so disgusting. After washing and allowing to air dry, my hair feels like it‚Äôs coated in thick grease, and my normally very voluminous curls were weighed down leaving me with no volume at all."
112,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I love all cake products!! I use them everyday and have super sensitive skin but I have no issues when using these products
113,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"The product smells amazing!! A little goes a long way! But, I find the product too greasy for my hair type. I use it at the most once a week."
114,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Absolutely love This ! The smell the softness and everything!  Love these products
115,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"I've really tried with this product, but each time I've used it my hair has just become more dirty than when I started. It doesn't work at all. I don't mind the smell too much, but I can see why some other reviewers didn't like it."
116,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Did not like the smell at all.  Does not give you a clean hair feel or smell
117,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"I have used Hair One in the past, Cake gives me the same results but it is lighter so it pumps easier, it's cheaper and smells nicer. Very happy with delivery, product is perfect."
118,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I was hoping that this would be a good cowash but I can barely use it as shampoo because it makes my hair so tangled. And it doesn‚Äôt even smell that great
119,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Product is not great for thick coarse wavy hair.  I didn't mind the scent.  However, product left my hair feeling heavy and I had to rewash after I dried it."
120,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Smells really weird. Like other people have said part banana pudding part burning rubberz
121,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Love it but it stinks
122,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,Product came only 2/3 full.
123,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,I very much dislike the fact that it arrived exploded.I will never order this product again
124,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,The cap was loose product all (1/3 )inside the plastic bag
125,"Cake Beauty The Two Timer Suds Free Cleansing Conditioner, 10 Ounce",Size: 10 Fl Oz (Pack of 1),Verified Purchase,"Horrible for fine hair, leaves it greasy even with thorough rinsing."
