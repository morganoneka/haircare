THIS IS A COMPLETE FRAUD!!,"THIS IS NOT GIOVANNI DIRECT LEAVE IN CONDITIONER!!! THIS IS A COMPLETE FRAUD!! I use this product all the time and what I received from you is too thick, has a nasty scent, and the color is different!!! I would like my money back!!! There could be anything in these bottles, this is not what I paid for!!!!!!"
1,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,**FAKE**,"Bought my first big bottle of this stuff at Walmart. Loved it so much I bought this 3-pk because I knew I would continue to use it. Too bad I just ran out of my big bottle yesterday only to find out these bottles are filled with lotion!! Not even a good lotion at that! Should have know since the price was good, but since it was Amazon just assumed it would be legit. Can’t get a refund because my authentic bottle lasted longer than I thought it would so guess I’m just taking a lesson away from this order...*eye roll*"
2,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t Work AT ALL!😒,I’ve read so many good reviews on this product. Not sure if what I received is a different formula from everyone raves about but THIS DIDN’T DO ANYTHING FOR MY HAIR!The first few times I made the mistake of not reading the directions carefully and I followed up with this after a conditioner rather straight after shampooing like it states. It sat on top of my hair and left a white residue and later a cast. So when I tried it correctly it did the same thing. It doesn’t seem to penetrate my hair at all and now I’m pretty much left with no choice but to throw the bottles away. It was a waste of money.Btw im natural 3c/4a tyoe with low porosity
3,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works and does not smell.,"It is not exactly WEIGHTLESS but it works and I feel the moisture stayed in my hair. This is really what attracted me to this product (I have dry hair). This also has no SMELL -- which is what I really like. Products often say ""fragrance free"" when they mean no PERFUME but then you walk around smelling  like coconut or pineapples (which is just as smelly). I work in office spaces where visitors come in and their heavy perfumes can be OBNOXIOUS. I find it offensive to be wafting scents in common work spaces, hospitals, labs and community centers. So I am relieved whenever I find some hair products that work without SMELLING."
4,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Feels like lotion - seems fake,I'm really annoyed with Amazon and their counterfeits at this point.  Everything is so questionable. They need to figure out how to screen these products because I'm literally on the verge or boycotting them all together. This product feels like I'm putting wash out conditioner in my hair.  It smells like a lotion from the 80s - old.  Not like grapefruit or whatever it claims to be. It's disgusting how many products I've seen to be counterfeit on here.
5,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Found something for my 4c natural hair!,"I love it! I purchased the pack of 3 when I was relaxed and my hair didn't really like it. Fast forward I started to stretch my relaxers then transition now I'm natural and have been purchasing different leave in con'd that just doesn't seem to cater to 4c hair like they claim so I found this product way in the back of my cabinet behind dozens and dozens of products. Don't know what made me give it another try but I'm so happy I did!! It made my 4c curls pop! I applied it on an old unwashed hair to re-do my large braidout (on each side). I didn't need to add water but I added a small amount of extra virgin olive oil then eco styler olive oil gel to tame the fly away hairs and perfect the style. I'm so mad that I've been just wasting money following the ""Instagram product trends"" when I had the secret in my cabinet the entire time. My next wash day is in two days. I'll see if it works just as well on damp hair. And in the future when I'm ready to blow dry again I'll see if it works. Tip: I applied about a quarter size amount to both sides of my hair and works it through. Once I applied the gel (because I need to be heavy handed with the gel to lay my hair) it look like it may leave residue but once you work it in and tie your hair up its clear and popping!"
6,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Leave In,"Curly Girl, 3b low porosity curls. Perfect moisture and consistency. Light, when you rub in hands does turn white but goes away once applied. Smell is fine, it doesn't linger but that's not a bad thing because I usually layer it with a styling product curly, natural hair ladies know what I'm talking about. Great deal for 3 bottles. Has become one of my favorite leave in, great for wash and go. It is also good for the summer months when we need our curls hydrated. Will definitely recommend and repurchase."
7,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally Weightless Leave In for the WIN,"I've only ever purchased this from Amazon so I don't know if it's fake or not but whatever is in these bottles is the best leave in conditioner/curl cream I've ever used.  I mix this with Palmer's Hair Polisher after showering and walk out the door.  I have 3a fine hair that doesn't like to be weighed down.  This controls frizz, enhances curls, and adds volume.  I've always washed my hair every morning because either my hair is a greasy mess due to product or my curls have fallen out but this stuff can be reapplied in the morning to perk up my curls and remains weightless all day.  Perfection!"
8,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible, fraud, not the real thing.","Very disappointed. I am African American and have 4b/4c hair texture. This product worked horribly on my hair. My hair felt hard and dry after using it, not moisturizing at all. Also I am about 99% this isn’t the actual Giovanni leave in. I’ve used this product before and it was a completely different consistency and texture from when I would buy it in store. I believe this product is a fraud and not the actual Giovanni leave in conditioner."
9,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product for 4C Natural Hair (Transitional Stages - Daily Wash n Go's),This has been for me one of the best products for my 4C natural hair which also suffers from a moisture problem. I have experimented with several different types of leave in conditioners but I find myself coming back to old faithful. It leaves my hair soft and does not flake when I use it daily with my Eco Styler Olive Oil Gel.It is very cheap I normally purchase the 3 pack for $18.00 and it lasts for almost a year I do my reordering around the 9th or 10th month. This is a really good product if you are transitioning and if you love to wash and go's daily or for refreshes and don't worry if it looks white when it drys it doesn't dry flaky but make sure you get WEIGHTLESS though there is a difference.
10,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Took getting used to,"I wasn't sure if I enjoyed this product at first. My first couple uses made my hair look stringy/thin. After a while though, I got the knack for it and now it only improves my volume and leaves my hair feeling moisturized all day in the heat, no frizz.I just really don't like the smell. I mean, fortunately it goes away, but it's nice to smell a nice scent. Like, when I apply my bodywash and the scent of sandalwood fills my nostrils, it just relaxes me. This stuff smells just like chemicals. Though, it is curly girl friendly."
11,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Ever,"I have fine, very curly hair and suffer with the typical problems of curly girls. I would hate to know the amount of money I have spent searching for the perfect product. Giovanni direct leave in conditioner is the bomb. It is moisturizing & taming without being greasy, sticky, or weighing hair down. The perfect application in my opinion is to apply a small dollop to hair as soon as you leave shower. Don't towel dry. Apply product to ends and crown then comb through with wide toothed comb. Tossel  with fingers occasionally during air drying for lift. I have been using the this leave in conditioner for years and am always disappointed when decide to try something different. I also use the Giovanni 50/50 shampoo & conditioner for a great product trio. Nothing better in my experience."
12,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great,This product has a very nice light scent that lasts for hours after applying. Just as the bottle says it is very lightweight however with it being lightweight I have to use a LOT of product to make my hair feel moisturized. Glad I bought the 3 pack as I'll be using it all fast. Works best for me when hair is damp. Would probably buy again for the summer because my hair requires much more moisture in the winter.
13,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,1-star reviews make sense now,"I just thought it was me but upon reading these reviews it all makes sense now; my hair felt like absolute garbage after trying this product. At first, I thought my hair just needed to get used to it but I tried 1.5 / 3 of my bottles, and ended up throwing the rest away. I've never used the ""real"" product but whatever I received from Amazon, made my hair feel like thick, sticky, straw. I don't know how else to describe it. It was so painful to try to brush my hair after using this stuff because the brush refused to go through it. This was awful, 0 / 10, do not recommend."
14,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware!!!!!,"I love Giovani hair products. I have 4b-4c hair and find their products leave my hair soft and manageable. I purchased the shampoo and condition from another suplier and when I saw this 3-pack deal, I had to go for it. Huge mistake. This conditioner left my hair feeling heavy and caused shedding. I question whether this is a genuine Giovani product. I will not be purchasing from this seller again."
15,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing leave-in conditioner for 4B/4C Hair!,"I absolutely adore this leave-in conditioner! It works better than any leave-in I've ever tried!Pros:- Leaves hair feeling super soft, moisturised and manageable- Has great slip making it easy to detangle hair.- Works well with products from other brands.- Penetrates hair easily and quickly- Does not weigh down hair and does not flake- Even though it's only 8oz it lasts a long time because a little definitely goes a long way!Cons:- The scent could be better, but that's being nit-picky.This is definitely a holy grail product for me! Would HIGHLY recommend it!"
16,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the right conditioner!,"This is not the Leave-In conditioner. It feels and smells more like their rinse-out conditioner, which I also use. These bottles had runny, lotiony conditioner.  Definitely not the same as the Giovanni conditioner I’ve been buying for years. It doesn’t condition or hold waves like it has, over even one day. Completely wrong product."
17,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Useful as both conditioner and styling lotion.,"Very nice product--has moderate hold and body, yet non-irritating to allergy-prone scalp skin.  Pleasant mild scent."
18,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy Grail,"This product is seriously the Holy Grail of all leave in conditioners. I've been using it for about 2 months ago and I lieterally trashed all my other leave ins conditioners because this one has left me super duper happy. I'm natural with a hair type that's 4b and I must say that despite the fact that my hair is thick and coarse, it really dosen't take much of this product to keep my hair well moisturised. This is literally one of those ""a little goes a long way"" type of products. So if you're cautious about how much of the product you put in your hair, the bottle should last you about 2 1/2 months depending on how frequently you wash your hair."
19,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kinky Hair Love,"I love this product and use it every week on my coarse natural hair. It helps to hold hydration, gives a great shine and I love the fact that I can get it on auto ship. I hate running out of stuff. Ultimately it saves me money because I don't pick up other things that are shiny objects in Whole Foods where I had been buying it. I hate when I hear people talk about 'good' hair and 'bad'  hair. But hopefully you will get what I am saying here, people tell me all the time ""I wish I had good hair like yours"". I find it pretty funny because I know my hair texture...and kindly adjust their thinking; bottom line... it really does help make it manageable."
20,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't detangle enough to be worth it,"I have thick, wavy hair almost down to my waist. It is difficult to brush when wet due to millions of tangles and so I always use some sort of detangler. Normally, I use some sort of spray-in detangler but when looking for something new, I came across this and bought it after seeing all the positive reviews.It does help a little bit with detangling but not as much as I'm used to unless I put in a ton. But then if I put in a ton, it leaves my hair almost like straw and heavy so that my curls are hardly even there. It's really gross. So I use a tiny amount and struggle at times to brush it out which makes me frustrated because why else am I using this product?"
21,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,FAKE,"The product was thick with a strong smell, and even after drying it left a residue on my hair. It made my hair frizzy and unmanageable. Luckily Amazon was good with helping me out, but do not buy this product! It is going straight into the trash."
22,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best leave in conditioner for my type 4a/4b low porosity hair,I’d purchased this product before about two years ago and I must have forgotten how good it was in my haste to find more products to use. Sometimes it’s best to keep using what works! This product gave my hair so much slip. My hair feels so smoothing and hydrated when I use this leave in
23,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,The best and only conditioner I will ever use!,"I have tried many products on my 4BC hair and this is the one that has made the biggest difference in my hair and my life. My hair has never looked or felt as good as it does when I use this conditioner. It makes the bomb twist out and my hair is super easy to comb through.  I sometimes use it on my face and it even makes my skin more youthful!I will never buy another conditioner again, I just wish I could get a lifetime supply lol."

25,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of Pros!!!,"I am enjoying this Leave-In very much. I have curly-kinky hair and when I apply this conditioner it leaves my hair (strands) with a white coating, but when it dries it is absolutely wonderfully. I have this Product 4 stars because I deducted one star for the fragrance/scent/smell-I do not like the smell. I LOVE the fact that it is natural and safe to use and that it is a Leave-In. The only additional thing I add to my hair after this Leave-In is 'Coconut Oil'...the combination works perfectly!"

This stuff works wonders as a leave in. I put other products on top of this for added curl definition, but a little goes a long way. These bottles are very small, though, and I prefer to buy this product in the larger sized bottles. Amazon, unfortunately, does not offer the same size/price as offered from massagewarehouse.com or from TJ Maxx /Marshalls where I buy bulk quantities."

I thought this was a regular conditioner (I didn't read the description very well) and couldn't firgure out why it wasn't helping. My bad! Once I realized it was a ""leave-in"" conditioner, I tried it. It honestly didn't work well for me. I do love that It is enriched with certified organic botanicals, has no animal by-products and it's cruelty free. It wasn't for me but I still love these products from Giovanni!"

I initially purchased this leave in conditioner at Whole Foods. Color me impressed! The product is light, yet moisturizing. I always follow it up with an oil, but for someone with less dry hair this lightweight leave in might do just the trick on its own. Because I am a product junkie, I have tried what feels like EVERY leave in on the market for people with my hair type. This stuff wins, hands down. Not sure I will ever use another leave in!"

I use with after shampooing with my favorite Giovanni shampoo.  It lasts until the next shampoo.  All I have to do is spritz my hair with a little water every morning before picking it out, and it is as soft and managable as it was when I first shampoo.  A light, fine mist of water is all that is necessary. You don't have to have a heavy oily product, what your hair needs is water.  Get that spritzer and go to it!"

I have very thick hair which can be difficult to comb through but once I put this conditioner in it's easy going from there.The only drawback is that it doesn't leave my hair feeling moisturized for a long time and leaves it feeling a little dry.

It does not leave my hair sticky at all no matter how much of it use. I use a lot of their products and I've been relatively happy. I even use it to detangle my hair in the shower.

This product is the best I have found and have been using it for about a year.  When I found out I could get it at Amazon for a better price than the health food store, I was very happy.  It has natural ingredients, blends well in wet hair and does not weigh down your hair or leave it gummy.  It is very cost effective because you do not need much to be effective."
77,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Another satisfied conversion!,"(preamble - I am a biracial guy (black father, white mother) - I never paid much attention to the curly hair types but at at glance I'd suppose I have 3A or 3B. Long and loose)I am another former Mixed Chicks user who decided to check this stuff out once the Mixed Chicks leave-in ran out and I was looking for a less expensive alternative.Well, not only is this stuff less expensive (a 3-pack of these 8.5 oz bottles is only slightly more expensive than a single 10 oz bottle of MC), it also works far better for my hair! MC was the first stuff I found that could keep my hair from frizzing and puffing out without also locking it in place like a helmet. But it still did leave a bit of a ""crunch"" behind and didn't react well to disturbances. Also, I was obviously growing dissatisfied with the amount I'd have to use what with the cost of a 10oz bottle.The Giovanni Direct Leave-In provides all of the same benefits with none of the problems. My curls are well-defined and behaved but still feel soft and springy. They can be played and messed with and suffer no ill-effects. It also seems like the Giovanni Leave-In is actually conditioning my hair into a better more hydrated state. I don't need to use as much and if I skip a day it's not a total disaster! The other stuff seemed more like it was just sitting there and doing an OK job, but Giovanni is behaving more like a treatment.All told, I am extremely satisfied and have found a new product for the long haul!"

I haven't taken the extensions out yet, but they're nearing the very end of their life, so when I recieved this shipment I thought, hey, I'll jus try them on my (human hair) extentions and see if it helps at all. Let me tell you it helped a LOT. Not only does the hair feel softer, but it's less frizzy, and it even brought back some of the natural curl that was there originally. Needless to say, I'm impressed.Will update this review after I get to try this stuff on my natural hair.UPDATE 3/26/14Extensions have been removed me after a healthy haircut (I'm also transitioning from chemically relaxed to natural hair), I can officially say this stuff rocks. I've never had less trouble detangling my hair, and it helps my hair hold moisture lots better. I get great curl definition when combined with other curling agents. I've even put a bit of this in a spray bottle with some water to help with nighttime detangling. This is great. Get a bottle somewhere and at least try it."

I have been using it for all 4 years of my natural journey. It doesn't weigh down my curls, but still provides moisture and leaves my hair soft.

Nice packaging, and very lovely smells. :) You DO get three bottles, so they aren't lying when they say 'pack of 3'. I keep hearing so much about Giovanni, so I decided to test it out myself and purchase it. The only downside is, if you don't live in the States, it's a little harder to purchase this since apparently this item can only be sold within the States. So luckily for me, I was able to find a way to get it shipped to my country. Giovanni is mostly natural products too, so you don't have to worry about all these harsh chemicals and bad odors. The scent is nice, very mild."

I have very dry, coarse 4c natural hair and I'm in the stage of trying different products I think this will be  a staple of mine.  The first time I used it I was a little heavy handed with the product but it is weightless so my hair didn't feel heavy or saturated but OMG did it feel soft.  I had tried Carols Daughter leave ins and they made my hair feel brittle and dry and I've tried Shea Butter line through Target (no results) but this makes my hair feels so soft and makes it manageable which is a shock to me.  So my routine for those who are interested: I shampoo or co-wash my hair, then I apply EVOO throughout and section and apply the Giovanni Direct Leave In as I detangle (this seems to work best for me since my hair is so thick).  I use a wide tooth detangling comb and my new love (Tangle Teezer - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE It) after detangle I twist that area and continue throughout. Usually I let it air dry or go right into styling.Anyways I love the product and i'm glad I brought the 3 pack from Amazon"

It does tend to add moisture and softness to my hair after using for almost a month but with my hair it frizzes to no end if I do not use some sort of gel/moose product. I was hoping this would take the place of that to repair it but make it look decent. It is helping with repair but I do not like the look of my hair with this product after it dries....it still tends to frizz and seem to get out of control.

I purchased this item on a different Amazon account, the three pack. After washing my hair and using this leave-in, the difference was immediate. It has a slight scent which I can only describe as lightly shampooey. The consistency seems heavy in your hands, but once you apply it, you realize that it does not weigh down your hair. It leaves no residue as long as you use enough and don't over-do it. I have very long, thin but voluminous hair and expect this three pack to last me at least 4 months (and this is considering that I gave one to my sister, who also loves it).I have stopped using special shampoo, coconut oil (which made me break out but was awesome on my hair), jojoba oil (which I still use on my skin) and every other hair product I owned. Now I use either Herbal Essences or Dove shampoo/conditioner and this leave in afterwards. That's it! This product left my hair manageable, shiny, and with so much volume. I am in love!"

Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave-In Cream

   to the Giovanni, but will keep using the Giovanni.Giovanni is a better deal pricewise. Similar price, bigger bottle, and I found less is more.  My medium-thickness shoulder-length hair was detangled but felt coarse until I stepped it down to a mentos-sized blob. After that it had a nice silky feel. It rinses cleanly off my hands and, presumably, my hair also. But if you use it without washing out the previous application, it'll go back to feeling sticky.The Neutrogena gives better results, texture-wise. I'm guessing it has a little more oil, or at least oils that work better with my hair. Very soft and smooth, and no harm done if you re-apply it without washing."

You only need a small amount (I use two squirts in my mid-back-length hair), which I apply by squishing into my hair.  It provides a nice barrier for your hair before you add in any styling products that may be drying.I've also found that it's practically impossible to over-apply it; it really is so lightweight that even adding in too much won't make your hair greasy-looking.It's also Curly-Girl-friendly for those following a no-silicone, no-sulfate routine."
289,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dry, brittle, tangled hair after using this product.","I have almost waist length mainly 4b natural hair which I have lovingly nurtured for the last 5 years. Up until a couple of weeks ago I had been using Giovanni Direct Leave-in-Conditioner for about 4 years with fantastic results.  My hair used to be extremely easy to manage after applying the leave in conditioner and my hair was in very good condition. However over the last couple of weeks I noticed that my hair was becoming brittle, dry and prone to tangling even though my hair care routine had not changed, (water, shea butter/natural oils and protective styling).  This resulted in me having to spend hours gently detangling matted hair. I decided to investigate; I washed my hair applied the leave in conditioner, and plaited my hair in four. I then let my hair air dry. A few hours later my hair was a dry, brittle, mess impossible to part without spritzing it with lots of water and jojoba oil. I have spent 6 hours detangling my hair this evening (my second detangling session of the day). My hair has returned to a manageable state, but only after applying another company's leave in conditioner (Mixed Chicks).Over the last two weeks I have lost a lot of hair through the detangling process and am not happy at all. I'm not sure what has been done to this product but I am sure that the 6 Giovanni conditioners that I have in my bathroom will all be thrown in the bin. I will not be using Giovanni products again."
290,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I had heard about this leave in for years.  I finally got my hands on some and I'm so glad that I did.  I'm black with a relaxer and I rollerset my hair every week.  This has quickly become my leave in conditioner of choice.  It's come the closest to making my hair as soft as the Dominicans make it when I have them do my hair. (LOL)I noticed that my hair actually takes LONGER to dry when I use this for roller sets than other leave in conditioners.  I think it's because it's so moisturizing and locks that moisture in.My only suggestion is that less is more.  The only time I've had a problem is when I've used too much.  You could literally see the conditioner stuck in the comb as I combed it out.  And my hair feels a bit harder when it's dry.  I have arm pit length hair and using a quarter size amount is more than enough.
291,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used. I bought it for my 5 year old daughter for something to use after her baths. Her hair gets really tangled and none of the kids conditioners ever work. This stuff is awesome! I now use it for myself and my son too!  It doesn't weigh hair down, it completely detangles her hair and makes it shiny and smooth. I love that Giovanni uses natural ingredients. I have since started using several other Giovanni products and I really love them all!"
292,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",4.0 out of 5 stars,new formulation,"I've used this leave-in conditioner for ~6 yrs or so and loved it.  They have changed the formulation with aloe as a new main ingredient.  The new formulation is heavier and stickier in your hands.  It doesn't work as well, often leaves my hair frizzy.  Doesn't smell as good either.  I was bummed, sent giovanni an email and haven't heard back. Now whenever I see the leav-in cond. in a store I look to see if I can find an old bottle with the original formulation.  Haven't had any luck finding any but then I came across Giovanni vitapro fusion, protective moisture, leave-in hair treatment.  It comes in a smaller cylindrical bottle and is a spray on liquid.  I looked at the ingredients and they were identical to the new direct leave in conditioner minus the aloe.  When I got home I compared to the ingred on an old bottle of leave in conditioner and it is the same except no panthenol.  So it's different but it does give you the soft texture that the old conditioner did but doesn't help with frizz and it seems you have to use more.  Perhaps the two used in combination will give me what I'm looking for.  I miss the old stuff.  So, I'm looking for something new but experimenting with what I've got."

I don't know what it is, but for a while now, you never know if you're getting a good bottle of it or a bad bottle of it. I've sworn by this Direct Leave-In Conditioner for a few years now, and the last bottle I bought of it, just a couple weeks ago, left my hair sticky and disgusting feeling, even when I used a very small amount. For this reason, and because the same thing has happened with their shampoos and conditioners, I would recommend never buying any of their products without first looking at it and smelling the exact bottle you're buying. If it smells or looks even slightly different from what you're used to, don't get it.Even in the stores, you see yellowing, awful looking bottles of Giovanni products when they should be clear. I used to see this only at the big drug store chains and attributed it to aging stock, but now I see it regularly at Whole Foods and my local natural foods store, where I used to be able to get a good bottle of it.Apparently the company claims this is normal. I would be fine with it if it were just the color of the product, but when it's like this the stuff doesn't work right, and it's just plain nasty to use. I suspect the few negative reviews of this product are a result of getting a defective bottle. It's really that bad when you get a bad bottle. I hope this stops happening sometime, because I would like to be able to go back to using Giovanni products with confidence, but until then I'm done with the brand."

I use it mainly at the ends, and only a little bit.  My reason for giving it 5 stars though is I have been using it before I go swimming.  I wet my hair and put this in (a moderate amount) and then wear a swim cap and I'm set.  It has alleviated my super dry scalp and seems to prevent that brittle chlorine feeling.  I use the Giovanni Nutrifix deep conditioner after swimming, and after using a chlorine shampoo.  Seems to be my perfect trifecta against the chlorine."

It moisturizes my naturally dry ends very well and makes my hair feel super soft after it dries. It's hard for me to find a good conditioner for the ends of my hair. I don't put it on the roots because it makes my hair look greasy early in the day. I don't dye, blow dry, or straighten my hair so i can't say anything about that."

Is not greasy. Holds the hair marginally, just right. Not too much. Not too little.The only thing I don't like is the shape of the container does NOT allow you to store it upside down to allow forbetter dispensing as the product is being used. When you get to the bottom of the container, you must shake theremaining contents to get it out. It's like the old ketchup bottle. You can't store upside down for easier dispensing."

This is the first time I purchased from Amazon - bought the 3-pack.  Two of the three bottles were almost runny (and different color slightly) -  NOT the same consistency as the product I have been using for years. The third bottle seemed to be the right product, correct consistency.  Very strange and I won't purchase on Amazon again, even though the seller is listed as Giovanni. You need some quality control Giovanni."
328,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,A Miracle Product... Truly!,"UPDATE (10/2014):THE 4B HAIR IS STILL BOUNCY & SOFT! I have not changed my leave-in conditioner in 3 years because this one still does the job incredibly well. I've added Giovanni's Smooth As Silk Deep Moisture Conditioner to the regimen and made other adjustments to increase effectiveness:- Slather hair with extra-virgin coconut oil (cold expeller-pressed) and let it soak in while you handle other business (i.e. a quick & dirty pre-poo)- Wash scalp with Shea Naturals Thickening Shampoo (or whatever brand/formulation applies to you) or not (meaning, go straight to deep conditioning). Rinse with cool water, but at the end switch to warm/very warm water.- Use Giovanni's Deep Conditioner. Let soak in under plastic cap under a low-heat dryer (or not) for half hour to an hour.- Rinse out completely with cool water, make that quick switch to warm/very warm water, don't shake or wring dry and add the Giovanni Leave-In Conditioner. Let the water and product absorb into hair for 15-20 minutes.- Slather hair again with extra-virgin coconut oil, paying special attention to ends. This step seals in the moisture.- Then, use whatever holding/styling products (in my case, large section-by-section Jane Carter Wrap & Roll Foam and Andalou Naturals Medium Hold Sunflower Gel). I still use Kiss My Face Upper Management Gel [Medium hold] sometimes, particularly for slickbacks. Don't forget to trim those ends with BARBER scissors!NOTE: I usually do some type of wet set, not a wash n' go. I think the procedure still applies though to a wash n' go.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have medium-long 4B hair (fine, curly). I was looking for a leave-in that would detangle, but with mostly natural ingredients. Thanks to a previous, similar reviewer, I purchased this leave-in at a SuperTarget.Bottom line: It did what other conditioning products did not.I smooth on 2 quarter size (or less) dollops of this in my freshly washed (and sometimes conditioned) hair. I wait 10 minutes. Then, I can put a sturdy wide tooth comb through my hair with minimal resistance. The hair loss is dramatically less. I can do a wet set of my hair more quickly (in combo with Kiss My Face Upper Management Gel [Medium hold]  and Jane Carter Wrap & Roll Foam over it). Also, my hair looks and feels incredibly soft as well as healthy when the style is dried. There's no residue, and most importantly, my curls aren't weighed down. It's bouncy time!I've been using this product for over a year. I don't anticipate switching to anything else anytime soon."

I have low porosity, 4c natural hair and my hair no longer absorbs this product. It just sits on top of my strands and leaves a white, flaky residue. It acts like glue and causes my strands to clump together into a tangled mess once it is dry. I stopped using it and now my hair is behaving again."

I was looking for a leave in conditioner that would work for both of us. This is really a light weight conditioner which any hair type can use without a heavy feeling. Used it once and already liking it a lot. My hair feels so soft after application.
331,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible,This product is horrible and for some reason is not eligible for return it does not condition your hair it feels gooey if you put too much in made my hair dry and hard did not condition it at all it's not a light conditioner it feels heavy and weighs your hair down... I gave it one star because I couldn't give it no stars but it's not worth any stars
332,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,It's the best leave in I've ever used,I have very curly natural hair (no relaxer or chemical processing). I use this leave in as extra moisture and frizz control. I don't mix it with other products so I don't know how well any combo of gels or creams would work. It's the best leave in I've ever used. I water it down because it doesn't have that great of a slip. It minimizes frizz and keeps my hair soft all day. I will definitely purchase again.
333,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Staple hair product,I love this product. I like that its all natural ingredients. It moisturizers your hair instead of weighing it down. I have dry coarse hair and this softens it well. I use on my hair directly as a daily stying tool or I combine with aloe vera juice in a spray bottle and use as a quick hydrator for my hair.

335,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Unbelievable!!,"I absolutely love this product!!! I have a twa that's dyed blonde and I've been looking for this product because of the reviews on youtube. Couldn't find it at target, so I ordered it from Amazon.com. I use this leave-in conditioner to curl my hair. This is my first time using it and I can honestly say, ""THIS STUFF IS AMAZING""!!! It leaves my hair super-dupa soft and has absolutely NO greasy feel after it dries. I've used other leave-ins and they DON'T compare to the quality and feel of this leave-in. To get 3 (8.5oz) bottles for this price is incredible. I DEFINITELY WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN WHEN MY 3 BOTTLES RUN OUT!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT. (In a spray bottle, mix 1/4th vegetable glycerine, a tablespoon of sweet almond oil, fill the rest of the bottle with water. This is a great leave-in conditioner for my hair as well. Then I apply the Giovanni Leave-in Conditioner. My hair is without a doubt super soft."
336,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible. The consistency is like face cream,Horrible.  The consistency is like face cream.  I tried to dilute with water to make easier to put on but it does not dilute.  It's like vasiline water does not effect it.  The water does not dilute it.  This makes it very difficult to spread on hair evenly.  It will not detangle your hair.  Your hair will look greasy next day.  I love the shampoo and conditioner this brand makes.  However the leave in conditioner is the worst leave in I used.  I have medium length hair.
337,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",3.0 out of 5 stars,This performs decently as a leave in conditioner,"This was one of the first leave-in conditioners I used after going natural. I'd put this on my hair after conditioner washes, and it left my hair with a good amount of moisture, but little slip. I have to say, when I used Kinky Curly's Knot Today, however, my opinion of Giovanni changed slightly, since Knot Today gives me ample moisture and slip for my 4a/4b hair.Giovanni does perform for the price, and it's advantage is that it's cheaper (being half the price of Knot Today's $11). It's still good, but in my opinion, and for my hair, Knot Today is better. But, everyone's hair is different, so try it and decide for yourselves."
338,"GIOVANNI Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. , Wash & Go, Co Wash, Curls & Wavy Hair, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Thumbs-up,"Perfect condition, Brand New.  No leaks during shipping.  3 bottles sealed together in plastic to ensure safe shipping.  This product is good, especially as a finishing product, a little goes a long way.  I might not purchase again because it really is weightless.  It is called weightless Direct Leave-In conditioner, meaning it will not weigh the hair down and that is absolutely true.  Depending on the hair style, like normally when I do a twist-out I like to use a conditioner with some weight to it in setting up the twists, but when I take it down this is a good product to use during that stage.  Since I use this sparingly in the final styling stages, it will last a long time."

I needed something that would condition my hair but not leave it feeling dry.  I was lead to this one through a YouTube video about hair maintenance.  I am so happy I tried it.  I now use the whole line!  My hair feels so smooth when it is done and my hands are even soft!  It doesn't leave a filmy coat even though it goes on white.  The pack of 3 has lasted me awhile and I will be ordering my next round here shortly.

I've heard such great things about this product but for me, it leaves my hair too dry & since I bought the three pack thinking that I would love this product, I add it to water in a spray bottle & spritz my hair with it in conjunction with other hydrating products & I find that this works better for my hair."

Light weight and very little scent for daily leave-in conditioner for my daughter's curls. I have taken away one star as it used to be organic, now is ""natural"" and I would like to keep the pressure on to get back to full organic.

It was recommended for me by a friend who had a daughter with very thick and long (black) hair. I have the same thickness and texture of hair and need a creamy leave-in conditioner to comb through my wet hair before I twist it. This fit that bill but, even for my hair, I found it a bit heavy, and I found that it did not go as far a the Abba leave in that I've settled in to."

I like how it makes my hair feel and I think it will be an excellent summer styler for wash and gos, or if you want a really light leave-in for fluffier styles.  My only complaint is it doesn't plat nice with my SheaMoisture products.  It can leave white flakes in the scalp region, not a good look.  But in the summer I'll use it for WnGs."

My hairdressers are always surprised when I come in with my curl in tact how curly it is because when they're done using the salon shampoos with heavy conditioners all they get is droop.

I love how this has no silicones or protein: pure moisture. I have hennaed, previously bleached (recovering) short fine (but thicker w henna undoubtedly) hair. I use Jamaican black castor oil at night to help my hair grow out quicker, w some jojoba or coconut or evoo on the lengths, then shampoo out in the am w mane and tail. I use the mane n tail conditioner too. They are protein heavy and henna acts kinda like a protein so I like my leave in to be strictly moisture.  And no cones!!  How great is that. So I put this all over my clean damp hair root to tip then seal w some jojoba oil. I air dry, always. I swear this conditioner acts like somewhat of a styling treatment bc my hair dries so perfectly. Just how I comb it out of the shower. It adds moisture and shine and slight hold. Hair is sooo soft now! And what a fantastic deal this 3-pack is!!! I could see this conditioner being wonderful for all hair types!"

My hair is 4b/4c. I have had the hardest time trying to figure something out. I have purchased many products with very little luck. Many of my co-workers told me about this product. I finally purchased it from Whole Foods. After my ends were cut I used it and loved it. I received so many compliments on my hair. ""And if I do say so myself"" I really did wear it well :-).This product gets an A+ for me. I wish I tried it sooner. I am also using the Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie along with this. It is all working well together. I hope this journey is finally taking a better road."

I can run my fingers through easily, which is not the case with any other conditioners or leave-ins I've used.

Sure, it is light. Doesn't leave a residue or create build up. But the moisture factor is non-existent. Despite containing cetyl acohol as the second active ingredient behind purified water, which should provide a barrier sealing in moisture (aka water on damp/wet hair), there is just a disappointing nothingness happening.

Up until a couple of weeks ago I had been using Giovanni Direct Leave-in-Conditioner for about 4 years with fantastic results.  My hair used to be extremely easy to manage after applying the leave in conditioner and my hair was in very good condition. However over the last couple of weeks I noticed that my hair was becoming brittle, dry and prone to tangling even though my hair care routine had not changed, (water, shea butter/natural oils and protective styling).  This resulted in me having to spend hours gently detangling matted hair. I decided to investigate; I washed my hair applied the leave in conditioner, and plaited my hair in four. I then let my hair air dry. A few hours later my hair was a dry, brittle, mess impossible to part without spritzing it with lots of water and jojoba oil. I have spent 6 hours detangling my hair this evening (my second detangling session of the day). My hair has returned to a manageable state, but only after applying another company's leave in conditioner (Mixed Chicks).Over the last two weeks I have lost a lot of hair through the detangling process and am not happy at all. I'm not sure what has been done to this product but I am sure that the 6 Giovanni conditioners that I have in my bathroom will all be thrown in the bin. I will not be using Giovanni products again."

It is instead the ""Strong Hold"". It appears that the company is no longer making the most firm version, which I believe used to be the best hair gel out there, offering extreme hold that didn't flake and was quite soft to the touch. The ""Strong Hold"" that they are now selling here is noticeably inferior, offering no advantage over the hundreds of other products out there. It makes hair look flat after 30 minutes. It is very unfortunate that the company has moved in the direction of taking a good product and making it mediocre."

It combs through wet hair easily and washes out well. I tried this gel when my previous brand was no longer made, which was a great disappointment at the time, but I like this one much better.

I make my own flaxseed gel and wanted something that would travel well since flaxseed gel has a short shelf life. I used this gel a few different ways before leaving the review. I have 3b/3c hair (see @1sic4itchic on Instagram).I love to get a good hard cast to scrunch out the crunch and get bouncy definition. Think eco or wetline. It's not as strong as those but does give a good cast that you can work with. Here were my experiences:Mixed with leave-in condish - no good on day 2 curls. My hair was a thick frizzy mess. I did this method with different leave ins. Each time I got the same result.Mixed with oil - again, sticky residue on my curls the next day.Stand alone/just gel and water - sticky residue the next day. Killed the body it had on day one and I got frizz. It's odd. It doesn't look dull but my curls didn't bounce with this gel. It's not sticky like tape. It's the kind of sticky you get from product buildup but you get this on day 1.I sleep in a satin bonnet, on satin sheets, under a satin comforter. I am that committed. Lol!! Jk. It's got great ingredients, smells light and is affordable. Try it. It may work for you."

Doesn’t weigh down my very fine hair, but it is thick, so I emulsify some with water in my hands before applying to wet hair. There is a learning curve for the right amount to use, but once I zeroed in on the approximate amount for each time, the cast is easy to scrunch out, leaving my curls soft, defined, and ready to hold their form for 4 to 7 days! No other product I have tried lasts as long. I use a leave in conditioner or curl cream underneath and have found the amount used has a direct affect on the harness of the gel cast. Hope this helps. I tried many products before I found this glycerin free gem"

Wouldn’t get it in time from my local warehouse store. I ordered here on Amazon already knowing the beauty products are not legit. I needed the product and took the risk. It came in a 3 pack only, which was also another negative for me.  I received my three pack and find that all 3 are not clear and transparent and squeeze out smoothly. The color is tinged yellow and cloudy. The consistency is harder and leave my hair sticky and my curls separate into straight stiff strands.  I should have known it was not going to be the pure fresh product. It’s either fake or old."

It also hold firm all day long, even in light rain. I have wore this product for two days straight and it still works, a little re-hydration and re-combing and it's at it again: this was because I forgot my products on a weekend trip.

I use this and Aveda's Be Curly to manage it. The Be Curly keeps the curls defined and soft without getting frizzy and then I use a small amount of this to help hold the curls a little better for a few days. If you use too much it will get a wet and stiff look. If you use too little, it won't hold. So you have to experiment with the amount. I've been using this successfully for many years now. I also use it in my daughter's hair which is similar, but it is thicker. It works well in her hair as well."

That appears to have dropped off the label now, but it's still a good product. The hold is good, although you might need to use a decent amount to make it last through the day. I have short hair, no longer than 2inchs and it probably takes me 1-2tbsp to create an all day hold.The product itself is nice as it doesn't feel sticky in my hair after a few minutes of it settling in. It's not a super firm hold, and your hair will still be flexible with it in. My only complaint is the cost - its a little on the steep side for the amount you get but if you search for multi-packs and some discounts you can get the price down."

95,"GIOVANNI L.A. Hold Styling Gel, 6.8 oz. Extreme Hold Surface Enhancers, Lightweight, Wash & Go, No Parabens or Phthalates (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Strong Hold, Healthy Ingredients","I have slightly thinning hair, and wanted to find a gel I could use that had good hold, but could also help in my ongoing battle with the receding hairline.  This fits the bill perfectly.  The gel has lavender, rosemary, and thyme extracts, all of which are traditionally used to strengthen hair and encourage growth.  There have been studies on these ingredients indicating that daily use can help restore hair growth.  (See, for instance [...]  I figure it certainly can't hurt to apply these ingredients daily, particularly when the alternatives contain chemicals with unknown effects on health in general, and hair growth in particular.Aside from the herbal ingredients, this gel just plain works.  As others have noted, it dries a bit ""scrunchy,"" but quickly works out and leaves good hold without a dirty appearance or feel."

It gives him a nice firm hold, but it isn't so firm that it makes his hair a hazard to touch. In the past he was using American Crew and that seemed to cause flakiness if he touch it too much. This gel does no such thing. He has been using Giovanni religiously for a few years now and has no intention of switching brands. It's a great gel with the added benefit of no toxic chemicals. Win win here."

It's also not hard or crunchy after you run your fingers through it, and once it dries, my hair feels soft even though it's still holding up. You can put it in your hair wet or dry, but I think I prefer putting it in wet because it takes less gel and looks tidier. Also, I thought I was only getting one tube but actually you get three. After a month, I'm not even through one half of one tube. There is a slight smell to it (that isn't bad) until it dries, and then there is no smell. This product is awesome!"

I use it with Giovanni Frizz Be Gone and it's the best combo for my curly, frizz prone hair.  It provides the right amount of hold without the bad wet look.  Although if you're going for the wet look, just use a little extra and you'll definitely end up with the stiff wet style.  Overall this is the only gel I recommend."

Doesn't remove moisture from the hair. In comparison with Giovanni Magnetic Attraction Styling Gel, the L.A. gel has a little less hold but is more flexible and 'moist' feeling when dry. This makes it great for defining tendrils, but not so great for curl setting a heavy mane of hair. No overwhelming smell (just a whif of the zesty lemongrass smell Giovanni products tend to have).  I have no complaints, but since I need a stronger hold, I will go back to my beloved Giovanni Magnetic Attraction Styling Gel for curl setting."

The value for your money is great 3 for $21 I feel is a pretty good deal compared to some of the professional products I have wasted money on. The hold on this is so good it can hold until second day and the scent is very light almost none which perfect for someone like me who doesn’t like strong perfumes or smells.

VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol.  I don't think so.  If you're going to call yourself natural shouldn't you be...can't there be truth in advertising?Anyways I used this and I got a lot of build-up and residue, unlike the Paul Mitchell Clean Gel I used.  While the Paul Mitchell Gel doesn't claim to be natural it does do a better job of not creating build-up and residue.  Anyways, Giovanni is about as natural as Pamela Anderson's chest, let's not kid anybody.

I know it's not *really* natural, but I'm not die-hard about that stuff. I've used this straight up a couple of times now (it's too hot to boil flaxseed), and I LOVE it. The definition it provides is amazing. It's so thick that I have to dilute it a bit before application (I rub a glob between my palms, then stick my palms quickly under running water).

I had run out of my Pantene Gel and wanted to find a gel that had no dangerous chemicals in it. This one surely seems to be the one! Because of the very high humidity yesterday, my curly hair was more frizzy than curly. In fact, the curls were flat and not formed very well. After I got home with my new purhcase, I scrunched a little bit of the gel mixed with a little water on my hair, which had been washed earlier in the day. The gel was not sticky, but my hair did feel a little ""crispy"" when the gel dried. I scrunched it a little and the ""crispiness"" disappeared leaving me with a head full of soft curls, plus my hair looked as though it was twice as thick as it did earlier in the day! I was very, very pleased!"

The pump is essential to create the foam. On nearly every bottle, the pump starts to stick in the down position just weeks after starting the bottle. This means that I have to pull the pump up every time before using it. What a pain. A couple of the pumps simply broke from being pulled up so many times. Giovanni needs to fix their pumps. In fairness to the quality of the mousse, it's good. It is medium hold and works well for me. So I don't give up on this product in utter frustration, I poured the mousse into an empty foaming hand sanitizer container. THAT pump never fails."

It isn't crunchy and my hair moves really well with it. The texture is great; I do not find it to be sticky or unpleasant in any way. Just signed up for subscribe and save after going through my first 3 bottles. I use this in conjunction with John Frieda curl styling spray and Redken align 12 protective smoothing lotion. I put them on very wet hair (Frieda first, Giovanni next, Redken last - comb them all through), and hit my roots with the diffuser for a little lift, but let the rest of my hair dry on its own. This combo works very well for keeping my curls in all day and keeping the frizz in check."

The product description, and some of the other reviews made it sound like it would work similarly to a mousse, but without the heavy product-y feel on day two. It doesn't form a gel cast at all. It definitely helps with volume, but that wasn't what I was looking for. Also the smell is unpleasant, like an attempt at a floral perfume layered over a typical chemical-y hair product smell.It is ineligible for returning, so now I have three full bottles I cannot use."

Texture looks and feels great, not sticky, just slick and smooth, but immovable!

I have really curly hair and this mousse works great with it! I have to use quite a bit but then again I did with my previous mousse as well. It can be a tad sticky, but not too bad. Just a bit. It makes my Curls form perfectly and beautifully separates them while keeping my hair frizz free. I touch up the ends at least once while my hair dries. I really love this stuff! And I feel so much better knowing I'm not dumping a chemical cocktail into my hair anymore. Hopefully the damage of years of doing so can be undone! This mousse also gives my hair just the right shine which I appreciate so it doesn't look dull. I am so happy this is so affordable too. Great product all around.

I really wanted a moose that was lightweight and absorbed into my hair rather than create a hard cast. this reminds me of the shea moisture hibiscus mousse. very lightweight my hair loves it and it helps with my clumps. and I can follow up with Ozzy Insta freeze gel for a hard cast and long-term hold or a more light weight cream gel or moose for a lighter cast. definitely helps with frizz. my hair is fine yet textured. definitely loving it."

73,"GIOVANNI Mousse Air-Turbo Charged Hair Styling Foam, 7 oz. , Lightweight for Natural Curls, Medium to Firm Hold, Wash & Go, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a long way,"I have shoulder length hair with long layers.  My hair texture is a mix of some curly/some straight - so just a mixed bag of lifelessness if I do nothing.  Just a quarter size dollop of this mousse worked to puff up my hair just from an air dry and then to higher proportions using a blow dryer.My routine is as follows to get the best from your products if you suffer from lifeless hair:1.  Wet hair thoroughly2.  Take only a quarter size of shampoo, rub your hands together and gently massage your scalp.3.  Get some water on your head to create a lather4.  Do not lather your ends5.  Let the water run through your hair until it runs clean6.  Take a cup of half apple cider vinegar and half water and lightly work it through your hair7.  Rinse your hair8.  It should feel ""squeaky"" which means that your hair is clean (if you use a lot of product, be sure to use a little more shampoo/vinegar until you achieve the squeak.  I do not condition because my hair is not dry.  I tend to have well-balanced natural moisture in my hair.  Lightly condition the ends if you need to and rinse thoroughly.9.  Gently squeeze dry your hair10.  Wait until your hair is lightly dry naturally or lightly dry with blow dryer11.  Take the quarter size mousse into your fingers, not palms.  Rub together your fingers and lightly work it through your hair starting at the roots.12.  Continuously fluff your hair with your fingers if you are air drying or now begin using the blow drier to lift it the way you wantThis routine has worked great for me for a long time.  I hope it works for you.  Less is more."

Wella no longer makes the Volumagic, and I have been on a year-long quest to find an adequate replacement.  I've tried regular mousse, which leaves white flakes on my clothes, and Aveeda products, but nothing left my hair with body, but still feeling soft.  The Giovanni Hair Styling Foam is just what I've been looking for -- it is a liquid that turns into a foam when you use dispense it and it works beautifully on my fine hair to give it a little body without making my hair feel like it has ""STUFF"" in it.  To top it all off, I get 3 bottles of the Giovanni for the price of one bottle of the Wella Volumagic.  I am so thankful to have found this product.

The ""foam"" is just as thin and insubstantial as that lathered soap. Yes, it does make it easy to disperse a minimal amount of product through your hair because it's pre-diffused with air, but for me, even with a minimal amount it just makes my hair looked soaked, and then I'm combing soaked hair, which results in shiny crunchy hair, which is not conducive to the look I'm going for. Plus this company is full of sh#t; if you paste their ingredients into EWG's Skin Deep site, some of the ingredients come up with the same health concerns as bigger corporate products."
123,"GIOVANNI Mousse Air-Turbo Charged Hair Styling Foam, 7 oz. , Lightweight for Natural Curls, Medium to Firm Hold, Wash & Go, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best mousse ever!,"I've bought countless bottles of this mousse since discovering it a few years ago. I have naturally curly hair and this is the best mousse I have ever used. Other women ask me all the time what stylist did my hair, like I went in to a salon and had it professionally done! When I tell them it is naturally curly and I just used mousse and let it air dry they are amazed. I don't do anything to my hair other than put the mousse in and let it air dry and my hair looks shiny with perfect ringlets. Other mousse makes my hair crunchy or oily, but not this one.I know I know, I sound like I work for the company with this review. But seriously, this is the best mousse. I have recommended it to 3 other women after they asked ""how do you get your hair like that"". After using the product for months, the other women have been converted too.I originally picked this mousse because it said no lauryl or laureth sulfate which I have found to be irritating to my skin. It doesn't make my scalp itch and it makes my curls look great. I highly recommend for curly hair.- Abby"
124,"GIOVANNI Mousse Air-Turbo Charged Hair Styling Foam, 7 oz. , Lightweight for Natural Curls, Medium to Firm Hold, Wash & Go, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Mousse EVER!,"Ok let me First say this. I saw another review that said this product is not 100% Organic. Yes, this is true. However, this mousse is thee closest to organic, you'll ever find. The ingrediants are also very good, as well!Now about how this product works. I have very thick, straight to wavy, puffy dry hair. When I first tried this mousse, I was amazed and shocked. My puffyness went away in my hair-and it was so, so easy to manage my hair (for once in my life)! It basically enhanced my hair and the waves in my hair. It was not sticky at all (like other mousse's). If you have frizzy hair, I'd HIGHLY reccommend this product. I use this to ""calm"" my hair down and to enhance my hair (and manage it). It also makes your hair extremely soft (in a pleasant way). It does hold your hair (if needed as well), let me give an example. When your hair is wet or towel-dried (from the shower) You can put this stuff sporadically in your hair. This will just relax and manage your hair (you won't have frizzies or unmagable hair). This will also make your hair more soft when it dries. Or, when your hair is DRY, you can apply this and it will stiffen your hair somewhat (to style or to get any frizzies down). Also, if you want, you can brush your hair and it will feel extra smooth.I came into this brand a couple of years ago and they are truly amazing. The mousse is just one of many. And they've been around before all this other semi-organic stuff came out. Highly reccommend."
125,"GIOVANNI Mousse Air-Turbo Charged Hair Styling Foam, 7 oz. , Lightweight for Natural Curls, Medium to Firm Hold, Wash & Go, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not completely organic, but a great product nonetheless...","I happen to like this mousse. It performs like it claims, and makes my hair feel nice and healthy. It also smells great, but isn't overly ""girly"".Now, I feel the need to address the whole ""organic"" subject, in part because another reviewer's comments about them ""riding the organic market"". It is NOT 100% organic/natural, but nor does it truly claim to be. NUMEROUS companies use ""organic"" in their labels, and aren't completely organic or natural. You just have to be smarter than the industry, and be aware of this. It's a loathsome practice, but it's ubiquitous. Just walk out of the natural section/aisle of whatever store you're in, and pass through some of the others. You might be surprised how often you'll see the words ""natural"" and ""organic"" printed on the labels, and the products and brands I have in mind are some of the worst chemical-laden beauty products out there! Just turn a bottle over, and read the ingredients. Educate yourself about how to discern what the ingredients actually are. Easy peasy.This product, however, only has one ""unnatural"" ingredient, listed as PVP/VA copolymer. It's a binding/suspending agent. I myself would honestly PREFER everything (everywhere) to be natural, but it just isn't so, thanks to the petroleum industry, as it is clearly responsible for the vast majority of unnatural substances we come across day to day, but I digress. Check with the Environmental Working Group/Skin Deep, and you'll see that this ingredient is of minimal concern, and rated a 1 on their scale. EWG is a wonderful source for information on health and beauty products, among other things. I joined as soon as I found out they existed. [...]I'm thrilled that more companies are ATTEMPTING to make more natural products. I have a few other Giovanni products, and am quite pleased with them. They may not be completely organic, but they do support organic farming through their use of MOSTLY organic ingredients. If I find something completely organic and natural, and it works, then I'll use it. Until then, I'll continue to buy Giovanni. It's one of the purest brands I've found.Also, if you happen to be adamant about using only COMPLETELY organic products, don't let the other reviewer send you running off to buy Kiss My Face Products. They (along with many others) have had suit filed against them by none other than the ORGANIC CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION for misleading labels in the same regard. I myself have seen many nasty chemicals on their labels, including parabens, one of the nastiest petro chemicals out there, which I personally avoid like the plague. For those of who who are trying to go completely organic, check with the OCA. [...]. And do some research on the lawsuits. You may be interested in finding out the names of other companies that make the same claims. There's quite a laundry list that were included in the suit, and many of them include ""ORGANIC"" right in their names! A testament to how easy it is to try to mislead the average consumer!"
126,"GIOVANNI Mousse Air-Turbo Charged Hair Styling Foam, 7 oz. , Lightweight for Natural Curls, Medium to Firm Hold, Wash & Go, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best mousse ever!!,"I love this mousse for many reasons, but the most importnant one of all is that it works magic with my hair. I have very thick, coarse and curly hair. I have always had problems finding products that work well in my hair. I always looked like I had to much (wethead all day), or not enough (frizz head all day). This mousse is so different from anything I've tried! It makes my hair look like a million bucks. I put it on when my hair's wet and then I let it air dry. Then my hair looks like there is no product in it whatsoever, but still smooth and frizz free. It just defines my curls and makes it looks fresh and clean and natural. Since I have been using this product my husband said that my hair actually looks like a normal person's hair. I guess it's a compliment in a weird kind of way. People are constantly asking me what product I use in my hair because it is ""just gorgeous!"". I never got compliments like that before. The cool thing is that I think this product would be good for all hair types. Even people with fine limp hair would appreciate it. It adds volume and doesn't weigh your hair down at all. It is such a relief that after years and years of hunting for that miracle product, my search is finaly over! Oh and it also makes me feel even better that it is organic and natural. Score!"

What took me so long?!  This is a great product; it turned my waves into spirals, and helped manage my frizz.The instructions say to apply this to damp or dry hair, but I used two pumps at a time, raking and then scrunching it into four total sections of my wet hair.  Before applying it, I used my regular leave-in conditioner, which is also by Giovanni (

Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner, Weightless Moisture, 8.5-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)

  ), and I topped it off with some gel.  I blew it dry for a few minutes, and then let it airdry.  The result was soft spirals, with no tacky or sticky feel to it.If you follow the Curly Girl method of no silicone or sulfates, this is also Curly Girl-friendly.  I wish I had tried this sooner, and know that it will be in my regular rotation of styling products!"

Application to dry hair lowers the hold, but running wet fingers through your hair after application will stiffen the hold.If you are looking for a natural alternative to your current styling product, I recommend giving this one a try.Many ""organic"" products are loaded with toxic preservatives. Giovanni Natural Mousse is the only medium hold hair styling product I've found without sulfates, benzoate, or paraben preservatives.  Check out the Skin Deep page on Environmental Working Group's site for toxicity info.The container is recyclable.  The mousse is dispensed with a pump and not aerosol. Amazon's price is also much lower than any you will find at Whole Foods or other organic stores."

I do not use a lot of product, only when I am going somewhere special so the first bottle is lasting me, though almost gone so I'm buying another. It is still pumping out like the day it was new; no sticking and not being able to get it to work after a few weeks/months of pumps without a lot of fuss with running hot water and using toothpicks like happens with my hair spray (even though I always rinse it and dry it and cap it after use.I had straight (slippery hair, my hairdresser calls it), wear it short. It is also thick so I used about a .50 cent piece size squirt then run my fingers through my damp hair, arranged it the way I wanted and let it finish drying. After Chemo last year, my hair is finally reaching a decent short length and is curly/fuzzy. I use much less of this product - About a nickle size maybe, and run it through the hair, brush, comb it into place and add a couple of sprays of hair spray if I'm going somewhere, otherwise, just let it dry as it is. With the hair spray my hair is tamed even after sleeping on it. With just the mouse it lasts the day. If it needs touch up I just pump a bit on my hand and run it though the top lightly, again, lifting it a bit with the comb teeth.I would recommend it easily and am ready to put it in my basket.PS. I don't think Amazon had the product then so I purchased it elsewhere.Revised:I am still searching for a safe shampoo and discovered that the ""air turbo charged"" mousse has a bad safety rating so am changing my star ratings. Will still give it 2 since if it's like the product without the air turbo charged feature it's good for those not concerned about keeping as toxin free as possible."

As far as I know, plastic is neither organic nor natural. When I put it in my hair, it felt odd, like conventional mousses do (which I haven't used for years). I wanted a mousse bottle with a cap for travelling, which is why I bought this thing, and will use it for that purpose. But I will go back to Kiss My Face brand mousse (I think I'll wash out the Giovanni bottle when I'm done and refill it with Kiss My Face for when I travel next time).They claim ""Real organic hair care"" on the bottle...but they shouldn't insult their customers' intelligence."

I have fine strait hair and was looking for volume, hold and shine.  I used the foam three times, and was disappointed.  My hair was sticky and dull.  I wondered if I had not rinsed my hair well, so the next time I washed my hair, I took extra care in rinsing, even using cool water at the end.

Normally, with an average product, I would continue to use it up so as not to waste, but this is so bad I am throwing it out."

I didn't want a funky hair style; just something to set my hair and make it presentable.I've tried many products and the Aussie foams were the ones I settled on earlier but it still made my hair look plasticky.The Giovanni hair foam is excellent, it doesn't look like I've applied any hair product and gives me a decent hold. So this is the only product that made my hair look natural.In fact I've been complimented a lot for my hair which was a lot more that what I bargained for! I just wanted it to look presentable.The hair serum is a good alternative to those who prefer serums. That works well for me too, but it takes longer to add the serum onto your hair.It's a bit expensive, yes, but it's the best out there for me. It lasts quite long too, at least 3 months. One pump for medium sized hair (for men) and 1.5 to 2 pumps for longer hair.Hopefully it's equally good for people with straight hair as well."

It accentuates waves and curls even from just having braids in. Smells absolutely amazing but not a super artificial smell sort of a mellow coconut and berries type fragrance. Makes brittle ends look healthier. Makes hair feel smoother and hold moisture better. I wouldn't use towards the roots of your hair it will look too oily. I have a lot of hair I only need one pump per use. I only use after hair is dry and use a leave in conditioner sometimes before I curl my hair. This makes my hair shiny all day.

I LOVE IT! I have naturally wavy/frizzy/curly hair that poofs up in humidity, and I live in Seattle. You see my problem. I researched a bunch of products because I straighten my bangs every day and need them to stay straight during my bus commute and all the adventures I get up to. Plus, I'm a huge sweater, and I go dancing a bunch. All of those things do NOT lend well to maintaining straight bangs. However, I found with this product that I can generally keep my bangs straight all day. Now, it doesn't hold up in straight up rain, but if I avoid getting them wet, and they just get a little damp or it's humid, I can usually just wipe my forehead or comb them back straight. I use it every day now, after I apply a heat protection and blow-dry my bangs."

I just figured I'd try it because it had almost no scent to it at all and I get headaches from strongly scented hair care products plus I'm an auto mechanic and I have no desire to smell girly. I found that this stuff works better on my dry curly hair than anything else I've tried and even the woman who cuts my hair has commented on how well it works. Well my local grocery store quit selling this stuff and I tried some kind of argon oil which didn't work very well at all. I was very pleased to find this hair oil on Amazon and for a few bucks less than I was paying the grocery store for it.

I went to the hair dresser to get a trim and she doesn't use it. It was really windy that day and I had a few errands to run. Each time I stopped I had to take water from my water bottle and put it on my hair to tame it. But what was worse was when I woke up the next morning. I looked hilarious. I had to spray my hair with water before I could even go to the kitchen for coffee! This product really works! I had a permanent put in probably a year ago, before that,  I wore it pretty short but after, i had surgery the texture of my hair changed, so I decided to try a perm and now it looks perfect!

I added only a single pump and ran it through my hair (avoiding my scalp) and the ends immediately looked better while still being damp. Curious, I decided to do something I've never been able to do, which is blow drying my hair. No frizz or static, just incredible body and shine. My hair is super soft to the touch and has a lot more body than it used to, and has a very subtle sweet and buttery smell. I'm really happy that I no longer have an ""ugly duckling"" phase while waiting for my hair to grow out again. Just to note, though, it does smell a bit stronger coming straight out of the bottle than it will when applied to your hair. I would say the scent is hardly noticeable unless you're holding your hair up to your nose and actually trying to smell it. Not overpowering or distracting at all, and as somebody who's allergic to most perfumes and fragrances, that's a bonus for me."

But I remember years ago - before changing over to natural products and going by the curly girl method (mostly anyway) - I used to use and love John Frieda Frizz Ease, so I decided to give this a try. Though I wouldn't call it a game changer, it's helpful for sure. I use it on my damp hair before adding any other products (leave-in co, curl enhancer, and gel) and I carry it on me when out in case I get a fuzzy head. I especially like it just after getting my hair cut and styled as I tend to be extra fluffy and lacking my preferred curl definition afterward.I love that this stuff doesn't make my hair greasy at all. I can use quite a bit and it doesn't weigh me down or look wet. My hair looks softer with some shine after use. I often use about 3 pumps (sometimes more or less, depending) for my whole head.The smell is nice, but I gave it a 3 only because it is fragrance and I would prefer something natural. This brand has a tendency to use fragrance despite how natural they are and I'm so not a fan. Nevertheless, I buy many of the products.For reference, I have long, fine, naturally blonde, caucasian hair that's wavy/curly, super thick, and - of course - frizz prone."

Works amazingly.,"Thank you for all the positive reviews that led me to purchase this product. TodY was the second time using this serum and I love it. I’ve been bleaching my hair for yours so the ends of my hair have been really damaged. It gets dry and frizzy if I don’t blow dry, curl, or style it. I put this serum on the ends of my hair dry and it instantly made my three day old hair revived. Even my husband commenting on how good my hair looked. The second time using it was today after the shower on wet/damp hair. I let my hair air dry and it dried straight and not frizzy. Noticeably different, like I blow dried it straight (I naturally have straight fine hair).  I love the smell of this product. If I turn, I get a whiff and it makes me feel happy. lol. I’ve ordered the shampoo and conditioner today to see how that goes. Thanks for the tip, guys! Ps. The price of this product is unreal. I’m used to spending $50-100 on small bottles of Kerastase serums and this product has done more than those expensive brands."

I have struggled with finding products that don’t weigh my hair down that also help with frizz. This is it. I can use this before bed with another hair product or not, and it’s significantly less frizzy in the morning and i can also apply just a little in the morning on top and it helps too!!

It works well, as long as you don't over do it, it doesn't leave hair greasy and looks natural. It cuts down on the frizz. I find it works best if it is applied to wet or damp hair then brushed through. My hair feels soft but there is still some frizz when it is air dried so I took a star away for that. Otherwise it is a good product and does what I was hoping."

Current stress has caused my hair to begin to thin, and break off.  My comb was full of strands always.  I used this after washing my hair, so my hair was wet...  The gel felt 'thick' in my hand, and I thought...uh-oh!

I have frizzy hair that tends to warp into a half wavy mess throughout the day. I use this right out of the shower on my damp hair and let it air dry (way too much hair to blow dry!) and it cuts the frizz down. Once I've straightened my hair I use a small amount again when its dry. I still get the warp in the humidity throughout the daybut the frizz is cut down by half, so it still looks decent rather than a poofy mess! Its lightweight and doesn't make my hair look greasy either (blonde hair). Great price for the amount you get. I'd recommend it!"

I like to use a tiny dab on my hair when it is still damp before I blow dry.... or before I put rollers in if I don’t want to dry my hair. It leaves my hair silky and shiny and extremely manageable.

I gave the scent four stars because I didn’t get the blackberry smell. It smells amazing still, but had more of a warm amber or shea kinda smell more than anything. I like this product so much that I have been hardcore eying their shampoo and conditioner. I work in a warehouse, have dyed/bleached my hair in the past (though have been pretty easy on it the last six mos.). It very important to me to do my best to take care of my hair though and counteract any damage that I may do whether dying or styling, or damage from environmental influences."

I barely use a drop of this product and will leave oily places throughout my hair.  I have thick long hair but a fraction of a drop will leave oil wherever you touch your hair and it won't dry.  So I just have to braid my hair each time I use this, I keep hoping I will get different results and apply it differently but unfortunately it hasn't made a difference.

I have thin straight hair but I have a lot of it so finding something to smooth it out that doesn't make it greasy or weigh it down is hard. If I use the whole 1 pump in my hair it's to heavy and looks wet. I coat the pals of my hands and gently skim it over my blow out to get rid of fly aways and frizz and it works well.

The shampoo and conditioner I used to use, well, the company changed the ingredients over the years taking it from a natural product to a chemical cocktail. Though it still made my hair shiny, the last straw was when they ""repackaged"" the products - the bottle capacity was reduced 25% and the price increased. That's when I started looking around and found the Giovanni 2Chic shampoo, conditioner and potion. I loved them. My husband, after the first time I tried these products, looked at me and asked if I'd done something different to my hair as it looked softer.

The combo of the two products is the best I have found after years of experimenting with different items.  My hair product grave yard had become quite large!What I like about Frizz Be Gone is that it smooths out the frizz and gives my hair a nice bit of a shine.  I just need to be careful not to use too much or it will make my hair too soft and limp.  If I use just gel without this product, my hair is very frizzy.Giovanni recently 'upgraded' the packaging on this product to a pump bottle.  I'm sure some find this more useful, but I personally find it annoying and wasteful.  I just pull out the straw and use it as a twist off cap.  I need a fairly large amount of this product for my long and thick hair, so pumping out the product just takes too long and is too much of a hassle."

The scent was really what caught my eye and this stuff smells really great. The serum itself is really thick which I like cause the other ones I've used were runny and I would drop it on the counter before I can get it onto my hair. Which they had a larger size of this product but a little bit goes a long way and you don't need a lot. I'm sure this bottle will last me a while.Would recommend this to anyone who has frizzies or just to add some shine to your hair!

For years I've been using Shu Uemura Essence Absolue to tame and moisturizer my very thick, curly, frizzy hair. I've tried similar serums from Kerastase and other styling products from Oribe... All pretty pricey. This seems to be as effective for moisturizing my hair, taming frizz and adding shine. It smells a little cheap and drugstore-y but it is cheap!

I have a great hair dresser who recommended that I use a hair oil. While argon oil is very popular, it turns out that synthetic dimethicone is actually more similar to the oil naturally produced in our hair, and is the ingredient in frizz be gone. I use a dime sized amount of this in my dry hair before I brush and after every shower and it has made my hair much more shiny, soft and manageable. It really has gotten rid of the frizz.

I have lots of naturally fine blonde hair and was worried it'd make it greasy, but nope! I use just one pump right after a shower at night, and sometimes a 1/2 pump in the morning to smooth out my hair a bit-/define any curls-doesn't keep all frizzies down, but definitely helps maintain them and adds a light fruity/coconut-y fragrance that lingers. Lovely scent."

I like the pump bottle I just wish they would switch back to the old squeeze bottle like in the picture, it's near impossible to get every last drop out. And as long and frizzy as my hair is, I go through a lot of this, so every last drop counts. I am also a natural nut and the ""chemicals"" in this are more naturally reoccurring and therefore a good alternative to more damaging products (I had a chemist look into this who is also an organic nut).

I had tried several other brands, but ultimately found the Frizz-Ease to be better...until I tried Giovanni 2Chic.First off, it smells nice, even once my hair is dry, it still has a light and pleasant scent. As for how well it works, well I found it at least twice as good as Frizz-Ease. So good that I rarely need to use my flat iron after drying my hair. My hair is just past shoulder length, 20% gray, (lots of wiry bits) and I've been dying it for the past 25 years non-stop, so there is plenty of damage. It also has a natural slight wave to it that if left to air dry looks like a frizzy rat's nest. I use about two pumps, which is about the size of a quarter.Bonus: this product is not Animal tested, 100% vegetarian ingredients, and has no parabens. lauryl or laureth sulfates, dyes, or PEGs. I can't say I don't use other products with those things, but it certainly makes me happy that I found a more natural products that actually works better than a non-natural product."

This stuff works great! I use this instead of the curl cream and simply twist my hair into coils, add a little gel to hold it and let it dry. Once I scrunch it afterwards, it's incredibly soft, doesn't frizz and my curls stay all day. It costs a lot less than the Aveda products and I am very pleased with the results."

A little background: I have bleached and colored hair in generally not a bad condition but still damaged from all the chemicals. The bleached part of my hair is on the dry side. Recently I was reading about all those DIY home remedies so I tried one of those ""deep moisturizing"" all natural masks... Well, it didn't work out at all. My hair was dry as a stack of hay, ends all tangled and it took me a good 35 minutes to blow dry it with a brush. The whole day my hair felt terrible, dry, it even felt crispy to the touch. So when I came back home I had to take measures. I didn't want to wash it again to use a deep conditioning mask, since my hair was just recently colored I'm trying to avoid excess washing. I tried this Giovanni Ultra Repair Oil Serum and I could not believe it!! Just in few minutes my straw-like hair became softer, silkier and feeling as hair should feel! And if you use the right amount it doesn't leave your hair greasy and not weighing it down. Amazing results! To make sure I'm not being misunderstood, this serum is not a magical, permanent fix for dry hair. In my case, I still need good conditioning, deep treatment masks, but this serum is definitely does it's job and helps a lot!!!"

I now use just a pea sized amount on wet hair only on bottom half of my hair and it makes it silky. I’m so glad I gave this product another try because it does make my brittle hair very soft and manageable.

This has been a miracle! Not only does it combat frizz but when I put it in my damp hair before putting it up to sleep I wake up to GORGEOUS shiny and manageable hair. It cut my blow drying time nearly in half because my hair was reacting to styling right away instead of having to cover the same area over and over. Love the scent too, very soft but pleasant and fades quickly."

I usually use this product when my hair looks/feels dull to give it a little shine and to smooth the ends.  A little goes a long way!  Today for the first time, I used this product (after letting my hair air dry) as a protective serum to flat iron my hair.  The results are gorgeous.  I have a chin-length, tapered, bob and my hair looks so great.  I have been reading about all these different natural oils and what they do for your hair.  I was thinking of purchasing pure macadamia nut oil, because it is supposed to be a really good moisture sealant.  I already had this product in my cabinet and when I looked at the ingredients, macadamia oil is one of the top five ingredients.  I am very pleased and will likely alternate between this and my extra virgin olive oil as my main styling moisturizers/sealants.The bottle offers several ways to use the product, but using it as a flat iron serum is not one of them. I am surprised, especially given the popoularity of professional keratin straightening treatments, because I have used many different products/oils to flat iron my hair and this works wonders. It costs about $7 for a 1.8oz bottle.  It is ""ultra concentrated"" so maybe that's why?  But its totally worth the cost.  I will likely use this product as a flat iron serum and to smooth out my ends before wrapping my hair at night, as needed."

Your hair will be so oily I have no idea why some are doing that. I use this on my hair as soon as I’m done blow drying it . It smoothes out the ends without becoming heavy. You can use everyday on dry hair as a pick me up for frizz.

I was having a difficult time getting my hair to look somewhat healthy. Even with good shampoos and styling, I typically ended up with frizzy, dry, limp hair. Giovanni Anti Frizz has literally saved the day. I apply it to my damp hair after showering and blow dry. The results have been noticeably different. My hair looks shiny.. has bounce...and the frizz is at a minimum. This product is an absolute steal for the price!"

I use it on myself and my boyfriend and we both have very thick curly Italian hair. I bleach mine and this stuff is the best thing ever. Especially for the price you cannot beat this. My hair when I would straighten it before using this even after applying olaplex to my hair and letting it dry my hair would be stiff and the ends would be fried. This stuff repairs the damage, and keeps my hair shiny soft and lusciously smooth. Cannot recommend highly enough."

I try to avoid my roots the days that I use this, and instead concentrate on using it from mid-shaft down to the ends.  It does contain silicone (which I try to avoid as much as possible), so I only use it occasionally, when my frizz is really bad.It also has a nice, clean scent, which dissipates pretty quickly.I used to use CHI Silk Infusion or Biosilk, but wanted to find a serum that was cruelty-free and didn't have as many chemicals.  This Giovanni one is just as good as the other two brands, while also meeting those other criteria.I love everything that I've tried from the Giovanni line so far!"

So, so glad I did !!!I put this product on the ends of my damaged hair after putting it into a ponytail (much easier to get right where the damage was).Anyway, well … hum … at first, I didn’t really think the product would do much. However, I remained interested due to the smooth and silky feel of the product on my hands (and yes, I applied the leftover product on my arms and elbows … WOW !!! It made my skin so incredibly soft !!! )Anyway, off I went with my evening routine and really forgetting that the product was in my hair. Later that evening, I tried touching (playing with) the damaged ends of my hair (a habit I formed during my frustrating , hopeless, endless search often ending with the products failing to meet what they claimed … grrr !!!) Well, oddly, I couldn’t find my damaged ends 😮Amazing my over processed, rough textured ends, uncut (for now as I am growing it) dry, no body, tangled, frizzy, damaged, color treated, 54 year old (aged) hair suddenly felt healthy. Crazy as it seems, my hair had sucked up all of this product and left no oily residue. I was pleasantly surprised 😯 and found it truly odd.I did notice after applying the product, it was slow to absorb (2chic Repairing Super Potion Hair Oil Serum) but after all the ends of my hair was similar to dry grass or better yet .. straw 🥴WOW !!! What the heck !!! I actually had finally found a miracle hair product !!!Affordable, healing and outstanding (noticeable) results.I am so glad I never gave up on finding a product that actually live up to its promised claims.Truly by chance I found Giovanni’s hair products.Anyway, before running across Giovanni, I had just started using clarifying hair products but found them to be too harsh for my hair.Anyway, not too sure about the Giovanni products, I hesitated before purchasing, yet again another hair product that probably won’t work 🤑😪Well, I finally made a decision to try Giovanni. Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by the products I had purchased.One day while showering, I noticed a reduction in the amount of white residue on the shower glass doors. I already knew I still hadn’t found any chemicals that could clean glass like this and surely my roommate didn’t clean the glass. This made me wonder how this could happened without any scrubbing 🤔I was baffled as to why the glass was clearing up and started researching causes for this buildup. I found out that hard water has an instant crystalizing reaction when coming into contact with soaps that lather and foaming subs found in a lot of body washes and hair cleaning products.As I read, I learned that the chemical, crystallizing, reaction (clearly seen on the glass shower doors) was also building up in my hair and on my skin. So, even though I visually could not see the buildup on my body and hair , I did have noticeable side effects like blackheads clogging my pores, a dirty like film on my skin, itchy scalp, very dry feet and dry hair that would shed off sicking to the shower walls and always clogging the drain. Grrrr … what the heck (!!!) I couldn’t fix the endless shedding.As I continued researching, I realized that this chemical reaction, that occurs when hard water and comes in contact with lathering products, was reaping massive havoc on my hair and skin (let alone the frustration of trying to scrub that mysterious white residue off the glass and never really getting it off …  grrrr !!!)Please try Googling the area you live in and find out what your hard water ratings is. As for me, I now know what I am up against. I now no longer have to struggle fighting against hard water and its side effects of crystallization and the build up on my skin !!!Luckily, It just happens that Giovanni products are perfect for my area; Washington State. I am beyond thankful for Giovanni products !!! Giovanni doesn’t use chemicals that react to hard water. The very water we drink and shower in daily here in the USA and throughout the world.What a crazy , frustrating and financially draining adventure my search has been for an effective product to improve my hair and my skin .Thank You Giovanni 🤗This product has turned my hair around by bringing life to it via moisturizing, nourishing, healing and the ultimate outcome of youthfulness !!!"

I like being able to use my hands and fingers to distribute the product instead of spraying a mist. (You have to be more careful with mist to get it on your hair and nowhere else, especially not breath it in. Also, it doesn't seem to distribute evenly, even after brushing through.)My hair is more than half white now - so more coarse and frizzy. On day two it feels nice, not greasy.Edit: After using this for awhile I'm beginning to think there is a more lasting effect. I haven't had to use it after every wash and my hair is still nice to the touch.Edit: After multiple uses I still rate this 5-stars."

It is great for the money and worked way better than any other salon serum for hair that I have tried (super skinny by Paul Mitchell is a close second along with texture balance infuse by Design Line). This doesn't work too well in the humidity for my hair type because it is a bit too heavy and thick (I have fine, bleached, curly low porosity hair from the mid-lengths to ends) but this works really well at keeping my hair moisturized during the non-humid days. I have double over-processed bleached hair on the ends and this serum-cream makes it feel like it has been restored and almost like it has never been touched by bleach at all :)."

I wash my hair and do not condition it in the shower.With damp hair, I add this instead.  So not only do I save on conditioner and shower time,I save water too.  My hair is light, less frizzy, with more defined waves if I let it curl.  I am not someone who spends time trying to find the ""perfect"" hair product.  I'm a bare-bones kind of gal.  But I thought I would try this on a whim because it was mentioned in an article.  I'm so glad I did, it's become a staple."

I have Hermione Granger-like frizz (book, not movie) and thought this would be the answer, but found that it BARELY tames the crazy, and I need to add a 2nd or 3rd alternate with this.I do like that there is no residue on my hands or hair, it absorbs well, and it does NOT weight my hair down. Now I just use it on my ends to lock in moisture, or for a quick run through with a brush if I'm out on the town, but I do NOT use this for air-dry and go type deal that I usually have."

The shampoo I received is called Smooth as Silk but it's for damaged hair and is in a sepia-colored container.  Unfortunately, I  read that the container picture wouldn't always agree with the description so figured I was getting what I usually get.  And, to be truthful, I was lured by the good price and ordered it thinking how lucky I was.  Unfortunately, the Smooth as Silk for damaged hair isn't creamy; it's comes out of the opening more as a big blob.  Does it do the job?  I guess, but after you've had the creamy Smooth as Silk, this one is like shampooing with a runner-up."

Since going sulfate free my daughters curly hair is much healthier, my scalp isn't itchy or as flaky, and my hubby likes it as well. I have dyed hair and since switching to this my color isn't fading or stripping. I've tried other sulfate free formulas but they always left my hair feeling greasy after a day. With this im back to shampooing only every three to four days. The bottle sucks, it isn't user friendly, and it's smaller than a normal shampoo bottle. Shampooing with this takes a little practice, make sure hair is super wet and really massage the scalp. You aren't going to get the suds you are used to, but you will see a notable difference after a couple of uses. I only wish I could find a local place to buy:("

It's a good shampoo, and without SLS. It smells good to me.  (If you don't mind a tea tree smell along with the mint/eucalyptus.)  Cleans the scalp thoroughly, yet gently. Yet my scalp still itched after continued use of this shampoo.  I've had to move on to other shampoos for such problems.  (Not dandruff.  Seems to be a sensitivity to so much of the stuff used in shampoos, even expensive ones.)This shampoo was my first step away from those with SLS, and it did help some."

Background information: I am transitioning to natural hair and I am 18 months post relaxer. This shampoo smell really good and is very high quality. The conditioner is thick enough to create a great lather in my very thick and dense hair. I have only used the shampoo for one wash so far, but it left my hair so soft and moisturized and I was able to retain moisturized hair after my wash day was complete."

(My stylist says my scalp isn't dry or diseased; probably just allergic to sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates).  And like most tea tree oil shampoos, when this shampoo gets on your face, it gives a light burning sensation.  I find that Giovanni's Tea Tree Triple Threat Shampoo's burn is stronger and lasts longer than those of other tea tree shampoos I've tried, even when I take care not to get much on my face.My friend, whose skin is very sensitive and allergic to most things, does not react aversely to Giovanni's, though she has the same trouble with the light burning feeling on her face.I'd recommend it for itchy scalps, but beware the light burning on the skin of your face, especially around your eyes."

Whenever I have a headache I shower and use this shampoo it almost always relives my headaches, (which I get frequently). I never knew shampoo could make your head tingle. We used to buy it at Walmart, but it's pretty pricey 8 Oz for 7/8$. here we get three bottles for under $20. And I don't have to travel out of town to get it.My only wish is, I wish they came in different sizes. I have very thick long hair, which requires lots of conditioner, so we go through quite a bit of it. But I still highly recommend it."

This shampoo is great for clarifying, but it also does not strip the hair. It leaves it feeling soft, healthy and clean. Because it doesn't contain any SLS's it doesn't get very sudsy but once you get used to it you hardly notice. I wonder why they really need to put that stuff into the other shampoos at all. It has a very light and pleasant fragrance, but it def. doesn't overwhelm. It smells a tad like apples or something. If you are like me then you will go through one bottle very quickly. I use about 1 every 3 weeks. So you might want to stock up. I think I bought 3 bottles for about $17.50. That's a great deal considering that in most healthfood stores and even at Target, one bottle will cost you upwards of $8."

I've tried several sulfate-free shampoos, and had to go back this one. There is a noticeable difference in softness and curl definition even after one use. I find the lather comparable to sulfate shampoos. I prefer nonscented products and hate sweet or strong smelling shampoo; this one does have a fragrance but it is very mild and more herbal than fruity or sweet, so it doesn't bother me. When I had bought this shampoo locally, it was clear. As you see in the picture here, the product I received from Amazon is more honey-colored. I was worried it was a different formulation or the product was past its prime, but after trying it, it seems to work the same as what I bought in the store. My only change would be with the bottle. The narrow flip top is a bit awkward."

I receive 3 bottles in a clear elastic package and have gone through 1 and 1 half bottles.

I have fluffy/curly hair that I've grown out a few times over the last few years and Giovanni has been the most consistent shampoo of the other often suggested scalp friendly choices.I use this (and the companion conditioner maybe once a week when my hair reaches the shoulders) along with a shampoo massage comb that can easily be found on Amazon for a good price.  If you really want the full benefit of a scalp circulation shampoo, but you have curly hair and can't really brush it like those with straight hair, I really recommend a shampoo massager for use when lathering.  Since using this routine my scalp hasn't been overly itchy."

Nice packaging, and very lovely smells. :) You DO get three bottles, so they aren't lying when they say 'pack of 3'. The only thing that's false about this product, is that weird brownish looking colour displayed on the picture. The shampoo bottle is not that colour, it's white. :P I keep hearing so much about Giovanni, so I decided to test it out myself and purchase it. The only downside is, if you don't live in the States, it's a little harder to purchase this since apparently this item can only be sold within the States. So luckily for me, I was able to find a way to get it shipped to my country. Giovanni is mostly natural products too, so you don't have to worry about all these harsh chemicals and bad odors. The scent is nice, very mild."

Seems this is what clean hair and scalp should feel like.  It doesn't yield the 'tingle' on the scalp that some tea tree items are apt to do.  This could be a plus or minus, depending on your viewpoint.  The wife loves it as well.  I'll be buying again for certain!"

For me, this product is amazing.I'm almost 40 and have no health problems.  My hair is baby fine, mostly straight and fairly long and I have a decent diet.  I also do not dye my hair.I used to have crunchy ends and my roots tend to get oily if not washed every 2-3 days.  Just a little dab of this shampoo and it lathers lightly and rinses out as if I've conditioned my hair.  After years of use and trimming off the crunchy ends, my hair remains soft and silky. No tangles.Most times, I do not use a conditioner after using this shampoo.  After every other shower, or if I use any hot tools, I use in a pea sized drop of leave-in conditioner (

Very light and natural like a faint sweet flower.  You easily get used to the smell and will be pleasantly surprised to receive compliments after a hug.I really hate the rectangular bottle, but that's alright because I love this so much, I buy it by the gallon and use a pump dispenser.I started using this shampoo maybe 10 years ago. Out of curiosity, I keep trying other products that people rave about like HairOne, Wen, Biolage, Jason, Aubry Organics, and many others I didn't bother to remember, but none of the shampoos make my hair feel as wonderful as this 50/50 formula.  I end up giving the other stuff away.  Even the other Giovanni shampoos, don't compare to this one.  The wheat didn't clean well enough but also made my hair feel dry.  The tea tree felt great, but I didn't like the squeaky clean feel and making my hair seem a little wire-like.  The Smooth as Silk was similar to the 50/50, but a little heavier."

For this shampoo: 1) yes, the lather is weaker than shampoos with sulfates, 2) no, the shampoo seems to dry out my hair and cause it to be frizzy.  Luckily, the corresponding conditioner is good enough to fix the frizz.  The tea tree oil also made my scalp itch something fierce the first week I used it, but has since calmed down and my scalp seems to be healthier with less dandruff.  I'm a fan of the tea tree oil, but will be switching lines after I finish this three-pack.P.S.  I saw these on sale at Whole Foods recently if you're looking for a brick and mortar shop."

The natural ingredients appealed to me, and the tingle a bonus given the good reports I saw.Cleaning and manageability worked fine, but by about the second time around my scalp began to itch, and from that point on the itch worsened with each application.  However, my wife tried it, loves it, and is still with it months later.  My guess is I've an allergy to something in the formula."

Unfortunately, when I used the shampoo, I definitely got that dreaded feeling of my hair being 'stripped' of its natural moisture. I will say that the back of the box shows this conditioner as being kind of middle of the road as far as moisturizing goes, and I should have heeded that warning. If you are a person that likes a shampoo to really moisturize your hair, then this will not do it for you.One positive thing is that when I put it on my hair, it kind of felt minty, like how a peppermint feels in your mouth. It was kind of pleasant and unique. I definitely would not buy this shampoo again though. I need something more moisturizing for my hair type."

A little bit goes a long way. As you want your scalp will tingle from the tea tree and you will feel so clean after using this. But it does not dry out my skin.My son has excema with a lot of allergies and we have to be careful what he uses. This seems to work fine for him as well.I have colored hair and I haven't noticed it getting stripped out using this shampoo.I am ordering more.

Like reviewers before me, I noticed the new yellowish color the shampoo has and WILL NOT buy it based on several reviews that I've read. That being said....I also have curly hair that tends to be frizzy and love the softness, smoothness and bounce I get from the clear formula. It has been difficult to find lately; I looked in local super markets, WalMart and Target, but they only seem to have the yellow stuff. I don't really know if the formula has changed, as the product label is the same, but the clear stuff I use is wonderful. I LOVE the tingle I get when I wash and the scent is amazing. My hair feels truly clean afterwards, not just laden with perfumes. The fact that it's organic, made in the USA and SLS free is great! I have acne prone skin, and noticed with non SLS free shampoos my back would become irritated quite quickly (due to the suds running down my back when rinsing). That has COMPLETELY STOPPED with this product.....(I have since switched to SLS free body wash instead of bar soap). I'm not great at this reviewing stuff, but I think this is an excellent product and have already bought it for friends (who also LOVE it). The ONLY con for this product, other than the weird new yellow color is that it DOES and WILL sting like crazy if you get it in your eyes!"

When I finished up my last bottle of the TJ's brand, I decided to get the Giovanni one -- and there is a world of difference!The TJ's brand always left my hair feeling stripped and dry after using it, but this Giovanni one is much more moisturizing.  My sensitive scalp never feels irritated, and it doesn't leave my hair feeling dry or stripped.On days when I use this, I also use the matching Giovanni conditioner.This is also Curly-Girl-friendly for those who don't use sulfates or silicones on their hair.Another reviewer mentioned that this ended up damaging her hair and her boyfriend's hair, so I'm worried about long-term use.  Because of that, I've only been using this for one wash per week, but, so far, it seems to be working really well!  The other days, I use

I've used almost everything - big name brands (H&S, Garnier, Selsun Blue), generic brands, salicylic acid, lotion, exfoliation, pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, nearly everything. I was using Selsun Blue's medicated for severe dandruff when I became really bothered by all the chemicals. I'm not a greenie by any means, but I couldn't stand the chemical smell. Plus, the day after shower day I'd always get a few dry patches here and there.Anyway, I decided to get this on a whim. Just saw it on Wal-Mart's shelf and noticed the tea tree oil ingredient(which I had already heard good things about but never wanted to try because of the smell). I was pessimistic, but sold. Good choice. All the ingredients that I read were...98% natural - If I remember correctly there was one ingredient that was not natural. Anyway it smelled SO GOOD! Like peppermint! Wow! I rubbed the (REALLY foamy) liquid into my scalp and massaged. It rinses away and feels clean. Even more amazing? BETTER results than Selsun. Maybe it just worked for me but DANG! It is for sure worth a try. I recently got and now use the hair reconstructor as a conditioner. Nice hair. Naturally.I am annoyed by the fact that the product is a little pricey, the smell doesn't really stay, and that it foams up SO much (tons of dense bubbles), but for the results it really isn't a big deal. I'm getting my third bottle in two days."

And for an SLS-free shampoo, this one has a good consistency and doesn't drip off my hand on the way to my hair (Burt's Bees).Unfortunately, after using it for a few weeks I noticed that I had a lot more very damaged hair -- those coarse curly ones that remind me of ribbon after it's been curled along the edge of a scissor blade. My boyfriend used it too, and his barber asked him what he was doing to cause the sudden outbreak of split ends. We both have fairly dry hair, but it's of the fine and straight variety, not naturally prone to frizz or excessive split ends at all.I've since been on a search for an SLS-free shampoo that retains the good qualities of this one without damaging my hair -- no luck yet, but I'm sure I won't return to the Giovanni."

My hair doesn't feel dry and it doesn't look dry; it is smooth, and if I may say so myself, it's just beautiful.

Unlike other organic hair products it doesn't cost $8 to $20 a bottle.  This high demand, I think, has caused them to cut corners on the formula.  I used to use this product a good deal last year and it left my hair clean and soft.  Also, it used to be clear.  I agree with the other reviewer that noticed that it is now yellow.  I just used the Giovanni Tea Tree Shampoo last week and my hair was dull and frizzy.  Also, the ends looked ruffled.  I have kinky, curly 3c hair.On top of that, this shampoo seems too harsh.  If any accidentally drips into my eyes, it stings horribly and has me scrambling for a towel before I'm done!  I switched back to my Shikai shampoo and my hair is back to being shiny, soft, curly and frizz-free after using it.  I won't be using Tea Tree Triple Threat again.  Also Jason Natural Daily Shampoo Fragrance Free is terrific as well and gives me shiny, clean, frizz-free curls.  The Giovanni does, however, work great for my husband who has dreadlocks which is why I didn't give the shampoo one or two stars."

I am very allergic to all the sulfates that other companies put in the first 3 ingredients. Even the ""natural"" products, and burts bee's made my hair feel like straw, but this shampoo works best with an occasional V-05 hot oil shower treatment, and a good conditioner like L'Oreal royal jelly, frutice, or herbal essences will make your hair super soft. My hair has never been healthier (less split ends), and I've even been dying it. some say it might leave your hair a little flat, just use a hairdrier with a TINY bit of product for boost like you normally would! your hair is the best blank canvas with this product!"

It has a fresh light scent and doesn't tingle too much. I have 4B textured hair and use a lot of oils and product during the week and this really gets it clean to start fresh each week. I also use it on my daughter's hair which is really thick and curly and it works well. I do notice that it is more of a clarifying shampoo and not moisturizing so it does feel really dry after I wash however I follow up with their 50/50 conditioner or smooth as silk and my hair is back to feeling soft and silky.

Smooth as silk is my favorite. The conditioner is so rich but doesnt weight my fine hair down and the shampoo doesnt strip my hair. Peolpe alway ask me how healthy and shiny my hair look and i alway tell them to try giovanni. I would recommed this to anyone who love organic product or just anyone who looking for a great shampoo at a great price. The only problem is that because its 10o% organic it will spoil if you store in directly in the sun too long or dont use it fast enough which shouldnt be a problem.

I could hardly get a comb/brush through my wet hair afterwards it was awful.  I guess it cleaned my hair but it felt so yuck while wet and while blow drying.  This morning I woke up and for some odd reason my scalp was itching.  It could only be these products.  I may or may not finish these products or I may take them back.  I also thought the smell was horrible because their was basically no smell.  I still like desert essence coconut shampoo and conditioner to best so far.

Unfortunately, all three bottles had to end up in the trash can! It is absolutely unsuitable for my hair. Every time I use it, I end up with a head full of horrible dandruff that takes a couple of weeks to clear. I did not immediately attribute this upsetting occurrence to the shampoo, after all the ingredients look so wonderful, but having tried it three times and arriving at the same result leaves not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that the shampoo is to blame. Beware! Tea Tree Triple Treat will give you dandruff so bad, you'll have flakes everywhere, from your shoulders, to your pillow at night. I will never buy it again."

Which ever is used does not change the end product.C12-14 olefin sulfonate (coconut derived) - Also known as alpha olefin sulfonate, this is a synthetic chemical surfactant/detergent and it is often represented as ""derived from coconuts,"" but in fact, according to the report HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS by the University of Tennessee's Center for Clean Products and Clean Technologies, olefin sulfonates may contain contain traces of benzene, which is a carcinogen or reproductive toxin, and may also release it into the environment during the manufacturing process (as it is created using petrochemicals).According to the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation's* LIST OFSURFACTANTS (June 21, 2001), olefin sulfonate is a category 4 surfactant and is NOT approved for use in eco-labelled products. Olefin sulfonate contains 50% or more petroleum derivatives and is not considered to be a readily biodegradeable or nontoxic to aquatic organisms.The Swedish Society for Nature Conservation is an internationally recognized source of the cosmetic chemical industry for environmental standards.[...]According to the LABORATORY OF FORMULATION, INTERFACES RHEOLOGY AND PROCESSES (FIRP) at the UNIVERSIDAD DE LOS ANDES in Venezuela, thealpha-olefin resulting from polymerization is used as an alkylate in a Friedel-Crafts reaction that ends in an alkyl-benzene. By sulfonation and neutralization, an alkyl-benzene sulfonate of the detergent type is produced at a low cost, much lower than a soap from natural oil and fat origin.[...]"

It does not contain laurel/laureth sulfates, but it still feels thick & sudsy (sssooo nice when you're used to other runny ""natural"" shampoos).

I saw the Smooth as Silk Moisture shampoo online and decided to try it after using the 50-50.  Works very well on our hair to add back moisture after the 50-50 strips away dirt and finishing products and before we use a Giovanni conditioner.

Using the new bottle I realized it had a very different ingredients list, but I was still willing to give it a shot. During the first, my hair felt a bit stripped. The one I was using before left my hair completely moisturized during and after using it. I would even go so far as to say that it moisturized my hair even more than cowashing! I'm not impressed and won't be using it again. I fan girl over the conditioners, but the shampoo is a no go. Giovanni why'd you fix what wasn't broken????"

And I'm picky.,"I purchased this at Pharmaca a few days ago - they carry a lot of natural shampoos and this one came highly recommended. I am a picky product person and frequently try new shampoos and conditioners. My hair has been feeling gunked up and my scalp was itching and I was noticing more than normal hair loss in the shower so I decided it was probably time to check out a sulfate free option. This one kept coming up in online searches, and I was skeptical as I thought my hair would feel dried out - but I've now used it 3 times and each time, my hair feels a little better. The 8 inches of hair near my scalp is natural/virgin, and the bottom has been through hell and back. Years of bleaching and dyeing and bad water. I definitely notice some dryness at the tips, but to be honest, it's probably time for a trim anyways. The root area feels great and my scalp has had no itching and the hair loss in the shower has already stopped. I haven't liked any sulfate free shampoos in the past, but I have to say, I think this one has converted me! I did purchase the matching conditioner and I'm not that impressed with it, but I also got a few other Giovanni products - the leave in conditioner (which I like) and a pro-vitamin spray (which I also like) and those seem to help with styling and combing. All in all - I think these products are worth the money and I feel like I'm taking better care of my hair."

I don't buy it off amazon but this is the one i use. I don't find it watery but it is very gel like, not creamy or anything, but it lathers REALLY well. I hate when I can't get a good lather and this lathers up amazingly for me.I need to use a clarifying shampoo and this one works iwthout irritating my scalp. I do use another one (Paul Mitchell Clarifying Shampoo) but that is too harsh for me to use regularly, or even weekly.I get build up, major build up, and this works. My build up is due to both using products and due to hormones.The scent is nice, i think it's kind of like tangerine but I am not sure. I have brittle hair and it doesn't dry out my hair at all."

Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibi​scus was too gentle - my hair would not look clean, even on the first day. OGX coconut seemed too harsh. Giovanni was just right.I used to avoid all products labeled ""sleek"" or extra-moisturizing because I thought they would weigh down and straighten my 2A wavy hair. But lately my hair has been looking really dry and damaged. This shampoo plus extra-moisturizing silicone-free conditioners have actually revived my hair and now its looking even more wavy and bouncy. who knew?!"

I got this shampoo at Target and paid $7 for the bottle. I applied the shampoo as normal, but I let it sit on my scalp for around 5 mins and then I rinsed it out. I do not like the tea tree oil conditioner, so I use another brand. I also add a bit of coconut oil on my ends before blow drying my hair and my hair is so shiny and soft!! This shampoo is amazing!!!! It has helped my Dandruff and on the first wash got rid of the oily spot on the back of my head. If you have dry hair this shampoo is not for you. I have greasy hair and wash every other day.  I think the key is to let it sit on your head for several mins, that is when you feel the tingling and the oils doing the job!!"

I've been using this shampoo a few months now and it is great. First shampoo I will probably stick to and continue using (I've never used a shampoo more than once when the bottle was done). I still have to wash my hair every other day since my roots still get oily after sleeping on them for 2 nights but my hair is not nearly as dry, it is more manageable and shiny and from root to end much more consistent in texture and health. This shampoo feels milder than others I've used in the past so I don't feel bad washing my hair as often as I do. I do always follow up with a conditioner for my ends and the result is great. Doesn't do too much for volume... I've had days when my hair gets super flat after the shower (even with blow drying and curlers) and other days it has magazine worthy volume. Given the randomness, it probably doesn't have much to do with the shampoo itself so I am not letting this affect my 5 star rating. :) As someone mentioned, I've had more good hair days than bad."

It makes my hair soft and shiny and looks like virgin hair.  When I bought it for the first time, I was worried I would have the same result that I did with salon tea tree oil shampoo.  The problem with the other shampoo was that it had wheat germ oil in it and I have a wheat allergy.  I cannot use anything topically or eat anything with wheat in it or I have major problems.  Giovanni, on the other hand, does not have any wheat ingredients and is very gentle to my hair.  It contains no harsh ingredients like surfactants (SLS) or parabens.  I recently bought a huge bottle from an outlet store that should last me several months, at least."

Had a couple sample sized things of this and the conditioner so I thought I'd try it out. It's over-priced, and there's better out there on the market. But I have no real complaints about it.

After the first use it cured my dandruff and hair loss (I have very thick hair and was losing loads of it, though I never noticed thinning.) Don't be alarmed by the lack of lather, it still cleans wonderfully. I just apply the shampoo to different areas of my head (crown, nape of neck, back of head and ends) then work into my hair from there to make sure everything is covered. Don't be fooled into thinking all SLS free shampoos are similar, I have tried several and I keep coming back to this one. I just wish there was a bit more in the bottles."

I've been dying my hair for 6 yrs and I'm noticing less grey hairs? Not sure what's up with that, but if my natural color comes back that's a plus.

0,"GIOVANNI Eco Chic Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. - Apple + Aloe Extracts, Calms Frizz, Detangles, Wash & Go, Lauryl & Laureth Sulfate Free, Paraben Free, Color Safe",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good and moisturizing product, excellent for detangling (4C natural Afro hair texture)","So this is my honest LONGGGG review. I bought this product with my own money. I hope that this review will aid someone in making a decision about whether this product maybe right for them. I purchased this product from ""HappyUSA"" (fulfilled by Amazon, I have prime so it came in about a weeks time after purchasing) around early December 2016 so I have been using it for about a month now.My hair type: My hair texture is very kinky, coarse with really tight curls/ coils like a slinky, with the back being slightly looser. I guess my hair type is a 4C. I have rather thin strands of hair, each is very thin and easily breakable. I also have medium hair density. My hair is not fine because my scalp is not to clearly seen and it is not full because my scalp is easy to find. With this combination my hair is prone to breakage. However my largest issue like all naturals is retaining moisture. My hair is naturally super dry, almost like a desert. I feel that my scalp produces no sebum at all( or so little it is not reaching down any of my strands). In addition, my hair is considered low porosity so it is hard to get the moisture in my hair and products can easily cake up on my scalp.My reason for buying the product: Like many who buy this product my goal was extra moisture. I needed a form of deep conditioning since my hair loves it, but the ones I found on the market so far did not aid me. I used to use ""Natural Girls Rock"" deep conditioner, which had a lot if slip and mainly oil based but then it stopped agreeing with my hair. They maybe changed the formula or added more frangrance because it started to make my scalp itch and just sat on top of my hair. Plus all the ""Shea Moisture"" masque I tried just left my hair feeling dry with film on top of it. I could not find just a decent deep conditioner to leave my hair soft so I decided to give ""Giovanni"" a try.The packaging: The product container is in some type of parallelogram shape; it is wide at the base or bottom and then tappers or thins at the top. It is a thin container so I can see why some may complain they feel like they are not getting enough. The product is tall or average height but then thin so it tricks the mind into believing there is more product then there actually is, so hence the price. It is a slightly opaque white color, so you can see just enough in order to know how much you have left. They fill the container to the top with conditioner. The top is a flip open and close. One also squeezes to get the product out, almost like a plastic ketchup bottle. It is 8.5fl. Oz or 250ml. In the back ""Giovanni"" has a scale whether it is light or deep conditioner and according to them this is a deep conditioner. To my knowledge the product is not a fake or counterfeit but seems like the real product, especially when you compare the packaging to the official ones on the ""Giovanni"" website.Ingredients: aqua (purified water), cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetrimonium bromide, glycerin, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural fragrance, hydrolyzed soy protein, *chamomilla recutita (matricara) leaf extract, * citrus aurantium dulcis ( Valencia orange) extract, *cymbopogon schoenanthus (grapefruit) extract, *echinacea purpurea extract, *ginkgo biloba extract, *glycine soja (soybean) seed extract, *lavandula angustifola (lavender) extract, *rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) leaf extract, *macrocystis pyrifera ( sea kelp) extract, *mangifera indica (mango) extract, *salix alba (willow bark) extractThe product performance 4/5: There is a lot of hype around the ""Giovanni"" brand, especially the smooth as silk line. I heard that many had success with it and my friends told me to give it a try since I wanted a deep conditioner. I just needed extra moisture because my hair is very dry. When my hair does get moisturized effectively it can hold moisture for about 3 days without me adding extra product. This product did provide me with extra moisture. First I tried this on dry hair and let it sit for about 3 hours, just to be safe under a plastic cape ( I know their is debate about how long to leave a deep conditioner but this one doesn't have a time frame. Some say to leave it for 20-30min, others say 1hour, some overnight but 3hours works best for me). It left my hair soft, but not overly moisturized, so not super soft like my hair took in a lot of moisture and thus was disappointing. Then I tried it between washes. I wet my hair, and mixed the Giovanni with jojoba, vegetable glycerin and coconut oil (not to much). Again my hair was left soft but not as hydrated, however a little better then the first time. Finally, I tried it on freshly washed hair. I applied it through sections and like all the other times left it for 1-3hours. After rinsing the results were the same. My hair felt smooth but not as hydrated as it would be with vegetable glycerin mixed with water. This product may work best with a steamer or under a hooded dryer like most moisturizers do. But I rank this product so well because it made it really easy to detangle my hair. I finger detangle so this product worked really well with this method. It gently coats the hair, so the hair feels smooth but not heavy or like something is on it. The beauty about this product is that it is so light weight so no caking.So after using this for a month I found that:Pros- It is not expensive-like the squeezable packaging-product has enough slip and not crazy thick so great texture- on a moisture scale of 1-5 it moisturizes at a 4/5 with my hair. Thus, it does what it claims so I guess it works.-Works well as a base with oils and etc. ( in my experience it worked the best with these, I.e jojoba, coconut and vegetable glycerin water mix).- the best is that it allows for great detangling!-light weight won't leave crazy build up- a small amount goes a long way.-it claims to be USDA certified organic, no animal testing or parabens, sulfates (for those that are concerned about this)Cons- It claims to be organic but the ingredient list can be a con to some (not to me),especially since alcohols are the first five ingredients. However, remember not all alcohols are bad for hair just do research if you are curious or concerned.- Fragrance, which is a very strong irritant and really should not be put in anything, it is high on the ingredient list. So if you have sensitive skin like me, or a sensitive scalp or prone to eczema break outs this can cause this product to irritate the scalp. Some have complained about this and for me it was true. The product doesn't have a strong smell but try to keep it far from your scalp (conditioner is not meant on the scalp anyways).- Does not tell you when it should be washed off so not so great directions-not much product sadlyOverall I do recommend this product. It does moisturize, not the best for me but great for right now, it is low cost and comes in a decent size especially if you have medium to fine hair density. It is light weight, good slip, great base for other ingredients. Even though I loath the fact that it contains irritating fragrance, it is a good product. A little goes a long way. Make sure you pay close attention to the ends when applying and I will be repurchasing this product again when I run out. Hope this review helped someone."

It made my hair silky and healthy. The natural ingredients help a lot to not aggravate my asthma.  However, I purchased a new bottle in Dec. 2014.  The ingredients seem to have changed.  There are new alcohols listed in the ingredients, and they are the first ingredients listed.  After a few uses I noticed my hair seemed much drier and frizzier.  I compared a bit of the old on one side and new on the other.  There was a definite difference.  I'm very disappointed that they would change a formulation of such a popular product.I found this on another website. It seems to match what each of my bottles have listed: Here are the new ingredientsAqua (water), cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, butylene glycol, cetrimonium bromide, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural fragrance, hydrolyzed soy protein, *chamomilla recutita (matricaria) leaf extract, *citrus aurantium dulcis (valencia orange) extract, *citrus grandis (grapefruit) fruit extract, *cymbopogon schoenanthus (lemongrass) extract, *echinacea purpurea extract, *ginkgo biloba extract, *glycine soja (soybean) seed extract, *lavandula angustifolia (lavender) extract, *rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, *macrocystis pyrifera (sea kelp) extract, *mangifera indica (mango) extract, *salix alba (willow bark) extract."

It doesn't fade my hair purple color but it works great to remove any oily build up I have, and it leaves my hair so soft and bouncy wth movement!

The problem is that I would probably get at best 3 washes out of this conditioner since I have coarse, very coily somewhat thick hair. If you must hair type it, class 4 for african american hair. It seems to work better on hair that has an actual shampoo, if you do the no poo method or even cowash you may not feel the replenishing benefits this offers and it may not feel heavy enough for those used to that feel. It smells very nice, herbal like and has a very nice smooth feel, it really does make your hair *depending on your shampoo* feel like liquid silk, very smooth. It was very easy to detangle my hair even before I sat under the dryer for 15 minutes, afterward my hair felt heavy with moisture and its lovely light scent. Washing it out never left my hair feeling like it needed more. If it was readily available in Japan on base i'd buy it way more. I just can't see myself buying this small bottle once a month and waiting 2 weeks for it since I currently wash my hair weekly. There is a larger size available from someone on amazon but I can't spend that large amount on conditioner, so its my loss. It is very good though and its ph is about 7 if i'm not mistaken. Try it once you'll love it!"

Normally I don't notice the effects until after my hair has dried. Once my hair dried it was easier to brush through and shinier. I also liked the scent.I would definitely suggest giving it a try."

I tried to use it as a deep conditioner after coloring my hair and it just didn't work for me. My hair was going through some changes and too much product use I guess.Now it does work as a co-wash. It leaves my hair very silky and ready for the amazing giovanni direct leave-in. I am now a convert and am glad someone got it right after many years of searching for curly hair Holy Grail products.I have bouncy naturally soft 3B curls with no crunch or frizz for the first time in 30 years.

I don't love it but it is a brand I think I will play around with and see what else they offer. This product smells good and feels good on my hair in the shower. It leaves my hair really soft right after but a few hours later my hair feels dry. I am black with natural hair so it can get dry very quickly. What I have done is started using this only on the days I wash my hair because it has some great ingredients and I use aloe vera gel/shea bitter with it and my hair has grown alot. But on a daily basis I co-wash for ultimate softness and moisture I use Herbal Essence Hydration conditioner that stuff is AHMAZING!I also used this on my daughters hair which is mixed and thier hair likes it more than mine. Thier hair has a lot of bounce aftwerwards and thier curls are beautiful. So, I guess it depends on the hair but it still is not a product I would buy again for thier hair either. The price, the amount you get along with how it works on the hair is not worth a re-buy."

I think this conditioner is the BEST on the market for this purpose!  It has no gluten, so it is healthy and safe for the use of celiac sufferers, and it doesn't have silicone to build up on your hair.  The ingredients are high quality, and it leaves hair clean, moisturized, shiny and soft.The formula is thick and luxurious, super moisturizing (even though Giovanni has deeper conditioners).  My hair is thin, and this formula makes the most of what I have.  It smells nice, but not overpowering.  When I run out, I use other conditioners, and I can tell the difference in my hair - both in condition and volume.It is more expensive than Suave, but not as expensive as WEN or Hair One - and it is every bit as effective as WEN without the astronomical price and without the gluten.  I have to use a LOT of it to clean my hair, but when you consider that I don't have to buy shampoo, it kind of evens out.  Zero shampoo and twice the conditioner.  Not too bad, really.The only thing I don't like about it is the bottle is poorly designed.  I can never get all the conditioner out of the bottle, even when I store it upside down.  The last bit always gets thrown away.  I have this same complaint about all the Giovanni products - packaging that is artistic and not practical.  The lids break easily when dropped, the bottles are not stable and they are difficult to hold when wet.  Even so, I wouldn't use anything else.I like to buy this by the case because it is cheaper that way.  I have never found anything better for the price.  AND - for the majority of people who use shampoo along with their conditioner, you cannot do any better than Giovanni."

When Im at work I can tell you who is applying skin cream before theyve even finished massaging it into their hands. Im scent free as I get random migraines/headaches that are triggered by perfume. Shampoo and conditioner usually doesnt give me headaches/migraines but if I were to use it during a period I would throw up and have to wash the scent out with fragrance free products. Due to my 'blessed nose' I try to buy only fragrance free natural products now 10 years and I always keep this stuff around. Simply natural products dont work that great - Ive got waist long bleached/processed hair so I cant see overtime what works and doesnt. When Im able to handle fragrance I use this lightly scent product smell is gone within an hour of drying and its amazing. I only condition my ends as Im an oil tank up top :)Very good product especially for a more natural product its not as green as it gets but theres a point when super green just doesnt work unless you want to head into that no shampoo world (been there never again)

It hasn't been easy to find, but Giovanni shampoo (I've only tried the 50/50 Balanced Clarifying) and Smooth as Silk conditioner are the best I've found to date.This conditioner does an amazing job at smoothing out my dry hair.  My hair is pretty strong and more resistant to abuse than most, but it does get damaged from blow drying and curling with an iron every day. Unlike some brands (like Pantene) that leave a residue I can feel on my hair and hands after using, Smooth as Silk does not. When I rinse the conditioner out, my hair feels clean and has that nice slick feel to it that tells me it's fully moisturized. After drying and styling it, my hair looks shinier now too. Other brands, both cheap commercial brands and some sulfate-free ""natural"" brands, leave my hair feeling a little rougher.  Giovanni products have a nice, subtle fragrance that is not at all overpowering like some other brands (esp. like the Malibu and L'Oreal Sulfate Free that I tried).I got them originally at Target, but they don't carry the full Giovanni line, and I wonder how long they will carry Giovanni at all."

After just one use it got my hair back to the texture it was before i ever bleached it. This stuff is absolutely amazing. i bought the treatment version of this today and I'm going to see how well that stuff works too :) once i run out of the conditioner i will be buying the 33 oz bottle :):) its amaazzziinngg.

I just saturate my whole scalp and every follicle and let it sit for 3 or 4 minutes while i shave and wash my body, it makes my bleached hair soft, shiny, strong, and healthy. :):)"

Over a year ago, I developed an allergy to hair dyes as well as the ingredients in most store bought shampoos and conditioners..My scalp became very itchy from store bought products, which was driving me crazy.. I've gone natural since then, using only natural hair and skin products.. I no longer dye my hair, and as most woman with natural gray hair know, our hair just seems dryer and less silky at this age.. I've tried a lot of natural products, but have found this conditioner to be the best for my hair..My hair is now short, but up to a couple of weeks ago, it was shoulder length.. I did not find that I used this extremely fast as other reviewers noted.. I actually use less of this than I used to use of the store bought conditioners, and believe me, my hair needs conditioning..It leaves my hair silky so I can comb it very easily after shampoos, and it still feels soft when dry.. I can't smell it on my hair, but my husband comments a lot that my hair smells really good... I do use a little dab of a natural frizz ease product to control frizzing, but on days I decide not to use it, my hair still stays pretty much frizz free... I actually use the frizz ease because my hair is so thick, when it's really humid out, my hair seems to swell and I feel like i'm wearing a football helmet on my head. lol...It has a very light scent, very pleasant... I have also used the Smooth as Silk Shampoo, which I also really like, but I've found that Dr Bronners natural soaps actually works the best for me (makes my hair feel amazingly clean), but I still like this conditioner the best...One reviewer noted that the style of the bottle prevents the last bit of conditioner to be used.. That's very true, but I've found if you kind of wiggle and maneuver the cap off, you can add a little water, shake it up and use every last drop..It seems like most of the reviews left are for black womans hair.. I'm white, and I think it's perfect for my 50 plus hair..."

Nothing worked.  Not leave in conditioner, shine serums, nothing.Recently, I did some research into sulfate free shampoos and decided to try Giovanni, because it's also cruelty free.  It WORKS!  Granted, you still have to smooth dry the hair straight, but my hair has NEVER looked better - I'm really happy with it, and have even gotten multiple compliments at the office.Use this stuff - it's terrific, it works, and it's even vegan!  (PS: not as thrilled with the Giovanni shine serum.  It's okay, but next time I'm trying out the hair spray instead as the final touch.)"

I am a white woman with naturally thick wavy hair. I enjoy wearing my hair with a little styling product to make it curly. The problem is I am a bit lazy when it comes to caring for my hair and I have to condition and comb through it in the shower while the conditioner is still in my hair or else risk pulling large clumps out as I attempt to untangle it. Some conditioners have left me still pulling out clumps of hair in a fruitless attempt to untangle it in the shower. Not this though, this conditioner makes my hair silky in the shower and I am able to comb though it with minimal damage. So five stars for this product, no matter what I try I keep coming back over and over to this conditioner. My only complaint is the container it is in, the container shape looks beautiful but makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get all of the product out...please Giovanni, get better containers!"
95,"GIOVANNI Eco Chic Smooth as Silk Deeper Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. - Apple + Aloe Extracts, Calms Frizz, Detangles, Wash & Go, Lauryl & Laureth Sulfate Free, Paraben Free, Color Safe",5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful for kinky curly hair,"As with most naturals, I go through a whole lotta conditioner. Some don't have the best slip, so I use those for my co-washes. Some have incredible slip and are great at moisturizing so I keep those for regular conditioning after shampoos. This is what I use for REAL moisturizing and detangling. It smells great and provides the slip I need to get my comb through this forest of curls with remarkable ease. Leave it on for about 10 minutes and it works even better. Though kinky curly hair does usually require more conditioner than straight hair (my curls laugh at the ""dime size"" amount recommended on most bottles), I have found that this product works so well, that I can use half the amount I use with other conditioners. I start by dividing my wet freshly washed hair into 4 sections and smoothing the conditioner on each one, combing through with a wide toothed comb, and then doing a quick twist when I'm done with each one. I then rinse my hair with the twists still in. When that's done, I can untwist each section and either add my favorite oil, gel or moisturizing product to each section and retwist, then spin them on either side of my head. The next day when my hair is dry, I'm rewarded with lovely, soft stretched out curls. This and Trader Joe's Nourish Spa Conditioner are my top picks for best conditioner for thirsty curls. Love this stuff and highly recommend it."

It makes my 3ft (almost to my knees) of thick wavy hair shiny and easily manageable. It smells lovely and is a delight to use as long as you keep it away from your scalp (it's hard to rinse out of thick hair and starts to leave a buildup but you really don't need conditioner on your scalp anyways). The only problem I have is the bottle. It is poorly designed; it's impossible to get the last tablespoon or so of product out of the bottle without breaking it and the lid has a tendency to break at the hinge very easily. It is also super wasteful that it is only available in this size; I go through a LOT of conditioner because I have so much hair. Every 2 weeks a have the massive pang of guilt as I toss yet another non-reusable, hard to recycle plastic bottle. They need a better packaging design and a much larger size."

I've tried them all and this is the one I always go back to. The deeper moisture conditioner is exactly as advertised. Its like any other conditioner in that it may not work for everyone. My son has straight very long fine hair. While it works wonders on his prone to dandruff scalp, it drys his hair out too much. I find that one of the lighter conditioners like the tea tree one works better for him. My hair is fine with a mix of curl patterns that range from 3a - 4a. I will only use the deeper moisture or tea tree conditioner as my hair loves both. I do have to use a lot but its the same with any conditioner so I accept that. I find this conditioner to be excellent for co washing. I used to have to wash my hair with shampoo about 3 times a week but not anymore. I buy it in bulk from my local food co-op but this is also a good price. I prefer the option of being able to refill my own preferred container. My only complaint is the bottle. It is oddly shaped and it is hard to get the last of the product out of it. I highly recommend if u r looking for an affordable cruelty free product that works. Since my hair is fine, it tangles very easily. With this conditioner, the tangles just fall right out."

I like using the tea tea shampoo though becuz it simulates my scalp to promote hair growth then I use the deep moisture conditioner so I don't lose too much moisture in my scalp. Then I use the weightless leave in conditioner so I don't weight my curls down with too much moisture. It works perfect for my 4 type hair, haven't found any other product that works better yet. I try to use organic as my hair doesn't do well with alcohol or sulfate that is used in most hair products."

I have used everything, and it is hard to find something that actually repairs my hair, makes it shiny, silky and smooth. I have used 4 products at one time to achieve ""this"" affect. One for hard water (shampoo), one to detangle, one to soften-leave in, and another to make silky shiny. This product has allowed me to eliminate 2 of those products in just a matter of a couple of weeks. My hair is healthier than ever before, shinier and so this is much cheaper in comparison and easier too! LOVE this product."

Then I looked at other reviews and decided to give it another try, glad I did. The conditioner is perfect for Co-washing, if you are into them. Ideally this product would benefit anyone that feels washing with traditional shampoos are too harsh. If you use this conditioner as a co-wash and then follow up with your deep conditioner you will have amazing results. Don't forget to include the Direct Leave-In, which is great at putting moisture back into your hair. Now I love this product."

Instead, you will receive the Smooth as Silk conditioner, which is what is shown in the photo.Please be aware. Amazon really should fix this issue. Due to this, I had to return and locate the Root 66 conditioner elsewhere.As for how the product is, the Root 66 conditioner seems good enough. It lathers well and leaves my hair silky smooth. The scent is quite mild, not harsh. Also, it's vegan-friendly and SLS free, which is important to me. I use it with the matching shampoo.I chose to switch to Giovanni's Root 66 as I believe my previous products have been causing breakouts on my forehead and hairline. From research, the Root 66 line contains no acne-triggering ingredients. Too early to say if it's effective yet, however.I recommend the product!"

Giovanni Smooth As Silk Deep Moisture Organic Shampoo 250 ml

  . I didn't feel or see much difference after using the shampoo which smells very good btw, but after the conditioner I could feel my hair became much more softer and straighter. I have long thick hair never dyed but frizzy and dry. I would recommend to keep the conditioner on hair under a shower cap as long as possible while taking shower. The result won't make wait itself! Then after drying my hair with tower I applied a bit of argan oil to the tips and left it for about 10 minutes. Then blow dry. I feel like I've left a super expensive beauty salon now :D"

They have added Glycerine, taken away Butylene Glycol and swapped normal water for Purified Water. I don't know much about how these changes affect the hair or why they made these changes but the main thing I have noticed is that the product consistency went from slightly runny in a good way to gloopy-thick like thick wallpaper paste that has started drying. I can't really explain this thickness... also the detangling properties have now been affected. Before, I would say they rated a 3 out of 5 stars at detangling and now it has gone down to 1. I like the fact that this product is loaded with lots of nice ingredients, but the reason why I buy conditioner is for the purpose of detangling and because it no longer does that I will not be repurchasing. I don't know if/how these changes have affected anyone elses hair but my curly 4a hair no longer sees a use for this any more."

Gotta hand it to them, this did all they said it would and more. My daughter has 4c hair and swims weekly , this was a fab deep conditioner that left her hair soft for a good few days , detangling was a breeze. I have since then bought a few more bottles. My only drawback is the price and the fact that it’s only 250ml (compared to the average bottle of conditioner which is usually about 350 ml) which meant after a proper application I had about 1/4 bottle left. Overall it is a good product . I’m also going to try the 50/50 conditioner and shampoo in the same range."

Nice packaging, and very lovely smells. :) You DO get three bottles, so they aren't lying when they say 'pack of 3'. I keep hearing so much about Giovanni, so I decided to test it out myself and purchase it. The only downside is, if you don't live in the States, it's a little harder to purchase this since apparently this item can only be sold within the States. So luckily for me, I was able to find a way to get it shipped to my country. Giovanni is mostly natural products too, so you don't have to worry about all these harsh chemicals and bad odors. The scent is nice, very mild."

It is the only one that goes onto my long shampoo matted hair (I use a great tea tree shampoo for my dry scalp, but it leaves my hair very tangled) and detangles like magic. When I put it on it does feel just as it claims, ""smooth as silk"". It has an excellent ""slip"" factor. I am able to run my shower comb through it quite easily after distributing it easily through my hair, and I use way less product than my previous conditioners. After drying and styling my hair feels nice and soft also. I have never met another conditioner like it. I will definitely keep buying this product!"

This is the best vegan conditioner I've used. I have super curly hair so I go through a lot of conditioner to detangle. I will only use Giovanni. My only gripe is the bottle design. It is nearly impossible to take the entire cap off to get the last bit of contents out. I feel like I end up throwing out quite a bit of product because I can't get it out of the bottle. I'd prefer a more traditional bottle design rather than this sorta trapezoidal thing they've got going. But the stuff inside the bottle is great!

It's the only hair ""product"" I use besides a light shampoo and my hair is shiny, soft and never feels dried out (and my hair can tend to be on the dry-side). I live in the PNW and it fights frizz better than the WLI in my opinion, but still isn't frizz-free when I'm walking around on days without a hood on or something (but also I have never used it during the summer when its a bit drier, so it may fair better then). Either way, stuff this is awesome and I love that I can get it in a 3-pack, and would fully recommend it!"

27,"GIOVANNI Smooth As Silk Deeper Moisture Conditioner, 8.5 oz. Calms Frizz, Detangles, Wash & Go, Co Wash, No Parabens, Color Safe, Sulfate Free (3 Pack)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Conditioner........ A Little Pricey For My Needs~,"Okay value for the 3 bottles, totals around 24 oz... We usually buy paraben and sulfate free products, around 32 oz for closer to $15 or so, from our local Grocery Outlet. Thought it would be nice to have our hair care on Subscribe and Save for the convenience but may stick with our prior routine...This conditioner feels wonderfully silky out of the bottle and smells great too. I wouldn't say it makes my hair especially silky though. It's nice, no added build-up or anything, just not better than other natural type products we've used for less.If it's in your budget, it's a good product and you may enjoy it. Not sure if we'll be sticking with this one though. Smile. Hope this is helpful!"

The hair color helps my hair look and feel better, but this conditioner makes my hair feel wonderful!I had not used conditioner much in recent years, but after I started using Giovanni shampoo a few months ago, I decided to try this conditioner.  Now I use it every time I shampoo, which is usually every other day.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. A little goes a long way; I have shoulder-length hair, and a quarter-sized dollop is enough to work through all of my hair. I appreciate the fact that it does not have an overpowering scent.The conditioner is so thick that sometimes I have to shake the bottle (with the cap closed) in order to move it toward the opening so I can dispense it.  The dispenser is easier to use than another brand of conditioner I have used.  I don't have any trouble getting the last bit out of the bottle, so there's no wasted product.I love this conditioner!"

I bought this because of the ingredient list posted online. It says ""Deep Moisture"" online but the product I got was ""Deeper Moisture"" and had a bunch of unnecessary ingredients like different kinds of fatty alcohols added to it. That being said, it actually worked better than I expected. The bottle shape is cumbersome and makes it difficult to get all of it out. If they had advertised this honestly the shape of the bottle would have been my only problem. I don't like misleading advertising."

Calms Frizz, Detangles, Wash & Go, Co Wash, No Parabens, Color Safe, Sulfate Free (3 Pack)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a paraben- and phthalate-free conditioner that actually detangles and smooths!,"Finally - a conditioner free of parabens and phthalates that actually detangles and smoothes my hair!  I tend to have an oily scalp that needs daily washing (sorry to those who believe the less you wash the less oil you produce - definitely not the case with me!  And dry shampoo makes my head itch), but my very long, thick professionally hi-lighted hair needs some TLC or it quickly goes the way of straw.  I had gotten rid of all parabens in my products for several years now, but phthalates were the new problem.  I have used Davines Nounou for a couple of years now and LOVE it and switched between it and Bain de Terre when I needed more cleaning power, but, now that I'm pregnant, I wanted to be assured that there were no chemical fragrances in my products.  So, I put away the Davines and Bain de Terre and started using Acure Lemongrass shampoo and conditioner a couple of weeks ago, but the conditioner left my very long, thick hair frizzy and tangled - the kind of tangles that I haven't had since my surfing days.  It was awful.  So, I tried the Acure Moroccan Argan Oil conditioner, and, although my hair was smoother, it was now TOO weighed down while my scalp became super oily and broke out in acne near the nape of my neck!  They were HORRIBLE bumps, some of them as big and deep as cystic acne.  There seemed to be no middle ground for me - either natural products left heavy, pore-blocking residue from all of the oils or made my hair feel like straw...sometimes both.  I had read the reviews for Giovanni and was hesitant to try it because of the more recent reviews stating that the new formula isn't good.  I completely understand how frustrating it is to love a product and have the company change the formula out of nowhere.  Well, I was desperate enough to try it anyway, and I am oh so glad I did.  I used the 50/50 shampoo with this Smooth as Silk conditioner, and it's PERFECT for my type of hair.  This is the first natural conditioner I've ever used that immediately detangled my hair the same way typical conditioners with silicones do and left it soft and smooth.  I haven't experienced scalp itch or dryness for the shampoo, but I don't use the 50/50 every day.  I switch back and forth between 50/50 and the Acure Lemongrass shampoo, but I now consistently use this Smooth as Silk conditioner.  It's pricy, but, if you're as desperate as I was, you might give it a try.  The smell isn't delightful or anything, but it's a pleasant light, clean smell.  I might even continue using these products after the baby is born for health reasons.  Now, if only Pacifica could come out with a shampoo and conditioner, I'd be in heaven!  That's the only brand of body wash I'll ever buy again."

This product adds natural volume and makes my hair silky smooth. My hair is the type that quickly after brushing, strands of hair will clump together instead of maintaining a uniform look. This shampoo and conditioner completely changed this. Holy grail set! I find it isn't as moisturizing as I'd like, so I add 1/2 t Argan oil to my palm along with the conditioner before application (don't have an oily scalp) - adds shine and lessens split ends 👍🏻"

It's hydrating, non-greasy, doesn't build up and works great in combination with the shampoo of its line or alone as a co-wash (which is how I generally tend to use it). What I love most about giovanni products is that they perform consistently with my hair, every single day, regardless of the weather. It such a relief to not have to worry about having great results some days and dry, tacky curls on another. This is a great choice for people who don't respond well to cones and alcohols."

It's not tested on animals and contains no animal ingredients, which is great.Unfortunately, the bottle design, although very cool-looking, is terribly impractical!  To get the conditioner out of the bottle, I have to store it upside down when it's not even half-empty.  Getting the last quarter of the bottle out is difficult at best.  And getting the last ounce (at least a few applications) out of the bottle is impossible without removing the cap.I've found happiness by emptying it into an old conditioner bottle from a different brand with better design."

It does keep frizz away but when used with the shampoo my hair still feels dry. It may work for some but it didn't work for me. The ends of my hair are too dry for this product. I don't dye my hair, blow dry it or straighten it so my hair is just naturally dry on the ends. I wanted it to work especially since the shampoo really strips your hair and its so expensive.

I bought this and had no high expectations....the only all natural shampoo I have ever used that has worked is Hiku...but since its 30 dollars I had a hard time justifying the re-purchase. This stuff is just like Hiku! It is awesome!! My hair feels like its been deep conditioned everyday! Even after shampooing my hair feels moisturized...when does that happen?!!The smell is similar to a grapefruit...not my favorite...but I can live with it b/c this stuff does what it promises! The trick with all natural shampoo's is not to gather your hair up and squish it for lather...but to just work it through your hair and kind of massage to get lather. I know a lot of people say natural shampoo's and conditioners tangle their hair...and I think thats b/c they are useing the way you would a regular sulfate ridden shampoo. I also leave natural conditioners in a little longer...that seems to help :)....I will never be purchasing 30 dollar shampoo again!!

The positives: it's organic, not tested on animals, gives hair amazing slip, smells wonderful, and conditions nicely.

It checks all the boxes.  Detangling, , checked and double checked! Moisturizing  checked!Adds shine, absolutely!. Really pleased to have such good results from the first try.I  used this conditioner as a co wash and conditioner and added only hair oils and hair Creme afterwards. I have low porosity hair so I used heat by sitting under a heating cap for an hour both at the conditioning stage and applying the oils and Creme stage. The hair oils I used were a combo of avocado and coconut oils heated slightly and then apply to the freshly washed hair.  The results were lovely.  I would normally have to add a leave in conditioner but this time my hair is soft enough for right now . Maybe on Day 3 , I may need to add a leave-in. This will definitely save money on hair products., being that the Giovanni is so economical and you can reduce the amount of hair products needed. I will be using more of Giovanni‘s products going forward."

I like trying new products and keep looking for new silicone free conditioners. I came across this one at Marshalls and gave it a try.Most of the ingredients are natural which is really nice. It reminds me of the Tea Tree Conditioner from Trader Joe's. It is very light, not very rich or thick. I feel like my hair ""drinks"" it all when I apply it. It smells fresh and the smell fades when the hair is dry. It makes my hair soft a and shiny. I also use a pump or two as leave-in - I think it works great as a leave-in!I like it overall, but I wish it was a little richer/thicker. When I use richer conditioners (like Dove Dry Oil or Tresemme Botanique Coconut & Aloe) I feel like my hair gets more moisturized and less frizzy."

I was so disappointed when it didn't leave my hair feeling smooth, silky, or even soft. I used it at first as a deep conditioner and was unimpressed. I have been using it to co-wash until the product runs out and am getting the same lackluster results. I agree with the reviewers who commented on the impractical bottle design. I hope the company takes note. On a positive note, the citrus fragrance of the conditioner is nice for summer. I realize that products don't work the same for everyone, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying Smooth as Silk conditioner. It just didn't work for me."

When I got out of the shower and my hair was wet trying to comb it was absolutely horrible.  I could barely get the comb through my hair.  I have very healthy hair as well.  I just can't recommend this product.  It also had no smell.  After I dried my hair my hair smelled like I had been outside.  I knew I should have tried something else because I have used Giovanni products a long time and remembered I did not like them then so why would I like them now.  Try the desert essence coconut shampoo and conditioner.  It's actually good and smells awesome.  good Luck!

Calms Frizz, Detangles, Wash & Go, Co Wash, No Parabens, Color Safe, Sulfate Free (3 Pack)",2.0 out of 5 stars,"""MY"" Christmas Story.....","So, I bought this conditioner at the advice of many a natural hair afficiando's. I was painted portaits of grand illusions of how my hair would bounce like Tracy Ross Ellis. My hair would smell like hope and success. And finally it would be as slick and smooth as a 1975 pimp. I raced home with the anticipation that Ralphie had when he finally got his Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle! I hardly could take my shoes and work clothes off fast enough. I stuck my head under the faucet, flipped open the beautiful pyramid of a bottle and squeezed the liquid ""cure"" in my shaky hands. I put a whole heap of it in my 4c natural hair. I giggled out loud as i swished and swashed the heaven in my hair and on my scalp.  What was this feeling I felt on my hair? The smell, the more I swished the harder the swashes got, my fingers were getting caught in the fast approaching nap balls. i kept going, thinking this was all apart of its ingenious! Maybe things had to get worse before they got better. But my hair grew tougher and tougher, I got nervous- ""this can't be happening! Maybe some cruel 3a hair curly saw me eyeing the bottle at Whole Foods and went to the sink and replaced the real stuff with some other crap!"" I rinsed my hair out, looked up in the mirror and saw a tangled, knotty, nappy, hard, silky mess.  I was pissed.  Mom was right-I shot my eye out! Its not for me and my 4c! Maybe it will work for you, but i am getting a refund. This doesn't/didn't work at all. It made it worse.  I'll stick with Herbal Essence ""Hello Hydration!the end"

Calms Frizz, Detangles, Wash & Go, Co Wash, No Parabens, Color Safe, Sulfate Free, Liter Size (Pack of 1).",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonders on natural curly/kinky/coily hair too!!!!,"I have been using Giovanni products for the past 7 years now and I don’t know why I never thought to write a review up until now. I think it’s because now I work part time at a beauty supply store and I find myself recommending this line to so many frustrated and natural hair customers; I  feel the need to expand my review and add it to online shoppers as well. I am a black woman with natural curly/coily hair. I don’t do hair typing but for those that need it, I’d chart my hair type as a little 3C, mostly 4A and 4B. As you can tell, I have some loose curls but majority of my hair is kinky/coily. Why I love Giovanni and why it works for me. Now in the shampoo and conditioner, I’ve used both the tea tree one and smooth as silk one. My FAVE is smooth as silk although both are amazing to me. I get a lot of slip with this conditioner which allows my hair to detangle very easily. It has no sulfates nor is it drying. My hair feels so soft and it so detangled after use. Also, because I used to be a product junkie, I try to keep my products at a minimum now and this conditioner can be used for both co washing and for deep conditioning. It is 100% vegetarian, is not animal tested, and has organic ingredients as well as essential oils added (such as rosemary which promotes hair growth). I LOVE this stuff and even though I’ve strayed over the years and have tried other brands that seemed promising, I always come back to this! Nothing gets the job done and makes my hair feel as good as Giovanni does. Usually I wouldn’t go for a product that is “for all hair types” as those products are usually not designed for my hair and can have harmful and damaging effects but when I first when natural years ago, I saw this on sale at TJ MAxx and I purchased without knowing anything about natural hair care. I’m glad I did!!!!! This is a product I’m not afraid to recommend because I know it does exactly what I say it does. If you’re a natural like me, you should definitely give this a shot. Hope this review helps."

Wow.,"Giovanni is one of those companies where I tend to be a prodigal daughter. I drift away and go explore other brands that seem exciting but they don't answer to my specific needs. I then go to the store to look for a replacement and see Giovanni on the shelf and I think to myself, ""You know, I truly miss this product. My hair actually thrived with it."" But I don't buy it. I choose something else. It became an endless hunt from brand to brand for the perfect product until I finally decided a few months ago to go back to Giovanni. And honestly, I think I'm going to stick with it for good this time.I bought this conditioner on a whim from my TJ Maxx because I ran out of Aussie Moist. I have very kinky curly hair (Type 4a-c) and this product is fantastic for my hair. After shampooing, I section my hair off into four sections and apply 5- 7 pumps to each. I then make smaller sections and add another small pump to the ends and use a Denman brush (also a game-changer) to detangle from ends to root. I'm sorry, y'all, but finger-detangling is not an option. I was initially worried because of the ""smooth"" part of the name as I don't use heat, but it really makes the detangling process so manageable and moisturizes well.  It smells really nice and citrusy when I use it and it doesn't give me that squeaky clean feeling when I rinse it out. I hate that feeling. I like residual slip. The size is great as I use a LOT of conditioner each week and helps minimize any excess shedding when I detangle. I highly recommend this product. Between Aussie and this one, I think I'm set for wash days."

My very curly, often frizzy,thick 4a hair reaped many benefits from using this natural conditioner.I apply it to soaking wet hair and my hair just comes to life-my hair instantly feels as soft as cotton and detangling is so easy that when I run my fingers through my hair from roots to tips there is no snagging, stiffness or breakage whatsoever.I spend no more than 10 minutes combing through my hair prior to rinsing out as opposed to the normal 25 minutes so this one is a time saver too.Once my wash day has been completed,I find it hard to keep my hands out of my hair due to it being so smooth,soft and frizz-free.This bottle will last you several months so it is worth it. I have just one con:if you don't adequately rinse it out,your hair will be a bit sticky.I highly recommend this conditioner to those with dry,frizzy or damaged hair."

I was surprised at how foamy it is and had to check the bottle to make sure I hadn't accidentally ordered shampoo but it said conditioner on the bottle. The smooth as silk conditioner to be specific. I don't remember if I originally ordered the smooth as silk or the 50/50 so whether I received what I ordered I will never know. I'm not really a fan of these amazon product listings that contain multiple items. Anyway, it wasn't great for detangling. I feel like I've been able to get my wide tooth comb to glide through my hair much easier using other conditioners. My hair felt super squeaky clean after rinsing it out which also seemed odd, but again, I don't know if that's how it's supposed to work. It seemed to do a great job at cleaning my hair which isn't what I needed since I already have shampoo. I'm using a deep conditioner so I likely won't be able to say whether this conditioner had any effect on my hair moisture level so I won't leave too negative of a rating.

But it does the job well.  However, this is the second time I've bought this product, but this time I bough the larger version (24 oz.) with the pump.  The smaller version (8.5 oz.) bottle is not a good design to squeeze out the conditioner.  It's rectangular and fairly stiff plastic without a lot of 'give' and it was hard to squeeze out the small amount at the end when there was little left in the bottle. And the cap does not come off."

I had most of my original 8oz bottle left so I wanted to use that up (and planned on using the empty bottle to re-fill with the new stuff). Big Mistake.  Upon opening the gallon, I noticed it did not contain the signature Giovanni scent (pleasant, but not over powering).  This one had an off-putting, almost a chemical smell. The texture was wrong too...watery, almost waxy-like.  I've used Giovanni products for years so I know this wasn't a bad batch -- both the smell & consistency were totally off. Needless to say, standing in the shower making this discovery I was not happy at all.  Sadly, the window had closed on the time I could return it. This inferior ""mystery"" slime went straight into the trash.  Goodness knows what stuff they replaced it with. I am writing this review in hope someone does not make the same costly mistake I made. Buyer beware......"

My most recent on gallon bottle I ordered just reeked of artificial perfume scents.  the whole house smelled of this terrible scent! It triggered my Asthma!! This fake / Altered product is being sold through the Giovanni Company! I wrote to Giovanni inc. someone reached out and asked for the sku / Id # of the product.  I sent them that but never heard back.  Obviously the company is ""rationalizing"" the business by cutting down the quality of their products.

I have used Ecru with great success, and thought another silk type conditioner would work just as well.  My hair just didn't take to this. Unlike Ecru, which my hair type LOVES, this just left a stiff coating behind, and when I woke in the morning, my hair was a mass of mess. Not tangled, but certainly not soft. I had to use a ton of serum to get it back to tolerable. I DO want to find a way to use this, as it wasn't terrible, but just didn't work for my hair type. I'm going to try mixing with a moisturising conditioner, and see if that doesn't do the trick. I've had this problem before, and that particular solution usually does. I DID purchase an entire gallon, and I certainly will try many avenues before I write this off. For the right hair, this must be an incredible product-for me, as of right now, it just doesn't do what I need it to!"

(For several months, once, I had to switch to something more intensively moisturizing than this!)  This is my everyday deep conditioner that keeps my hair smooth and soft and detangled.  This gallon size is far more economical than buying several small  bottles in the store.  If you're looking for deep moisture on a regular basis, this might be the conditioner for you (but buy a single,  small bottle to try it out before investing in the gallon!)"

My hair is very curly, coily, tight you name it i have it! And the typical brands you find at the store like Pantene, Aussie, Tresemme are great when detangling my hair but would leave my hair extremely dry and brittle. I had heard some reviews about Giovanni but couldn't seem to find it anywhere! Then one day i was in the organic hair, soap, etc section in Target and found the super small section of the Giovanni line. I was so happy i finally found s bottle of it! After washing my hair with it that night my hair was so manageable, easy to detangle, soft, bouncy, and shiny. I have so much hair and after about 2 weeks i had ran out bc its only like 8 oz for $8 a bottle.. super expensive in my opinion.. so i searched amazon and found a gallon of Giovanni Conditioner. THANK YOU AMAZON for selling this product. Best investment i could have made so i can continue to have great hair at a great price."

I did the math and I could just buy 3 more (4 total) to get a little more than a gallon for $48+tax! I recommend checking out stores that have a name brand hair product section for low discounted prices like my local TJ Maxx. Only issue is that the products may come in randomly as is my case. I love giovanni shampoos and conditioners<3"

I would actually give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up to be generous.  I use this with a conditioning cap and then follow it with the smooth as silk regular conditioner.  It doesn't soften my hair the same way that other conditioners do and provided limited detangling.

It is all organic and animal free. I just made the transition to vegan and was looking for a product that would manage the frizz. This worked and it worked better than anything else I have tried.

33,"GIOVANNI Smooth As Silk Xtreme Protein Hair Infusion, 5.1 oz. Deep Moisturizing and Frizz Calming Hair Infusion Treatment, Revitalizes Coarse & Over-Processed Hair, Paraben Free (Pack of 2)",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent product, but you don't get enough","Overall, it's a decent deep conditioner; however, I don't think I'll be repurchasing it. I have long 3c natural/curly hair that is naturally extremely dry. This product is extremely thick, and you will need to use a lot of it to saturate your hair. It wasn't too much for my hair, but I could definitely see it being too much for finer and lower porosity hair types. It left my hair soft and moisturized which was great! The downside is that because the amount you get in the bottle is so little, 5 ounces I believe, I ended up using more than half a bottle for a single treatment. I deep condition my hair once a week and, even with buying the two pack, I ran out after 2.5 washes (I got 2 full uses out of it and then got through half of my head on the third wash). If you're going to use this as a monthly or biweekly treatment, or have shorter lower density hair, then go for it. It's good for what it is. But if you're like me and looking for something to use with every wash and you have a lot of hair, I recommend trying something else."

From the very first moment I tried this conditioner, it was an answer to my prayers for my over processed hair.  It had gotten stiff like hay and just about as brittle. I've tried protein therapy, special salon protein caps, and even avocado oil poured over my hair and left for hours. Nothing has come close to this conditioner. Extreme is correct, it's so worth it and so I'm buying in bulk from now on so I'll never run out.It doesn't leave my hair oily or weighed down.  It's all shine and frizz free. Another amazing plus.

You know, what made me swoon at the thought that there was an alcohol-free hairspray available that (CHA-CHING!) was also on Subscribe & Save.Welp. I finally read the bottle this evening to see that the very FIRST ingredient is ""SD Alcohol 40-B"". You know, the absolute worse form of alcohol you can put on your hair...I'm upset with myself for not looking over the ingredients before buying, you know, since I didn't see past the rose-colored goggles of the top search result for ""alcohol-free hairspray"".Outside of the damaging effects of the ""bad alcohols"" on hair and skin, these alcohols also don't help thinning hair, and can actually make it worse. I won't say ""causes hair to thin"" because I don't know, for sure, if that's the case.So, this review is for the thinning-haired, healthy-hair/skin desirers, and those who may also, later, feel duped by a ""alcohol-free hairspray"" buy-in of excitement to later have your hair go limp from sadness over the flagrant misuse of keyword phrases.I gave it a 2 (and not a 1) because it does brush out smooth, wash out easily without white flecks or build-up, and holds hard—just like it states. If only the worst form of alcohol wasn't the MAIN INGREDIENT... *Sniffles*."

Still has alcohol in it - and I imagine that drys my hair out still - but considering all the other great ingredients -- some derived from essential oils -- a superior product when compared to other things my wife has used. That's right, I've always robbed hair product from my wife - this is the first time I've bothered to buy it. I'm definitely not a pro at products like this, but it's been good to me.

Cannot use this, it is Curly girl unfriendly!

I have frizz prone curly hair,  and the spray is a lighter hairspray in my opinion that holds enough for an average day, but isn't that great for humidity. I don't think the spray is a ""firm"" hold as it states it is. With this spray I usually have to reapply later in the day as frizzies appear, but I like it mainly because I can apply and reapply throughout the day and it doesn't leave white residue or flakiness. I can not wash my hair for a few days and reapply this hairspray without feeling like my hair is gross with product in it."

So this is the way to go for the best deal. I liked this brand because it doesn't contain alot of toxic chemicals. I also have trouble with dry flaky skin on my scalp and this didn't make that worse. Some hairsprays do. I'm not positive that I will be purchasing it again. It is still really expensive hairspray, but if I can't find something else that works for me then I will be coming back."

I am so sold! It only takes a few small squirts! I lift my hair and spray under the top layer...one quick spray on each, and 2-3 in the back! Really helps my thinning hair, due to cancer treatments, to have volume! This price may be as good as what I paid at the auction....then I had to drive and pick it up. Vendor delivered on tome! I am so happy to have found this  awesome product where it can be brought straight to my door! Love Amazon!"

It has super hold, that lasts for hours, without  a sticky build up.. The scent is very mild, not too fragrant and it washes out easily. Only complaint is that sometimes I get a bottle that has a spray nozzle that doesn't work..I always make sure to save a nozzle from a previous bottle that works well so I can replace the non working nozzle with one I know works."

Maximum Hold Styling Spray, Retains Style and Adds Shine (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Safer ingredients!,Prompted to try while shopping in a health food store. The ingredients are a safer bet than the majority of hair sprays on the market. The product does the trick and it’s not an aerosol which is also a better option. Amazon pricing for a three-pack made it a more economical purchase.
15,"GIOVANNI L.A. Hold Hair Spritz, 5 oz. Maximum Hold Styling Spray, Retains Style and Adds Shine (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff! Wish they would fix the bottle.,"Love this! I have been using this for years- it holds well, feels light, and doesn’t have nasty propellants and other chemicals. Great more natural alternative. My only complaint is that I agree with other reviewers in that the bottle is pretty garbage-y. The spritzing mechanism gets jammed up and stuck down. Not from build up of hairspray- I’ve had some come out of the package that way. Wish they would fix that, but overall- I like this hairspray and will keep using it!"

Organic hairspray? Can it be?  Well, right there in the store I sprayed it on my hair (purchased it btw) , walked over to my husband and said: well??  Does it bother you?  He said, no- not at all!  I cannot believe I get to use hairspray again and I get a great deal for 3 on Amazon!!! (Jumping up and down for joy!)"

18,"GIOVANNI L.A. Hold Hair Spritz, 5 oz. Maximum Hold Styling Spray, Retains Style and Adds Shine (Pack of 3)",3.0 out of 5 stars,not very misty,"I'm actually surprised by the high reviews.  ..maybe it is because of the ingredients.  I have fine (not thin) straightish long hair. The hairspray is ok, but the individual spray droplets are huge (I like a finer mist and was expecting a mist when ""mist"" is in the product name).  Otherwise, I haven't found that there is really anything special about this product.  I was shocked that I received 3 bottles.  That is a lot of hairspray for me to have to use. BUT, I guess that makes it a really good deal too. Anyhow, if I ever run out of hairspray, I probably won't buy this again."

Maximum Hold Styling Spray, Retains Style and Adds Shine (Pack of 3)",3.0 out of 5 stars,I truly enjoy using this hair product,"I truly enjoy using this hair product, but Giovanni should really rethink the bottle construction. I am giving the three stars for the poor quality of the sprayer, which is a total challenge and nightmare. With more than one occurrence, the sprayers have been very difficult to push down. Also, I wish there was a screw cap, so I could fully empty the liquid contents into a new bottle of styling mist or transfer the liquid into a smaller bottle for travel. With the current bottle design, it is impossible to empty the liquid contents, and the styling mist goes to waste."

I just wish the bottle size was bigger ;)UPDATE: after 2 years of using this product I've noticed a few things that made me switch.-1- 50-60% of the bottles don't spray.  because their top doesn't come off I end up throwing them away.  bad on the money side, terrible on the environmental side.-2- Price has been going up and at up to $9 a bottle that is really expensive for a small size bottle of hairspray.(check with the 'purple' retailer)I still like the product but i'm sure there are others out there that are good as well."

My hair has been thinning in the front for the last few years due to illness and I was getting frantic.  I have long hair so not using hairspray was not an option.  This spray has a pleasant smell and tames my slightly greying hair.  When I touch it or comb it out, there is no stickiness or stiffness.  It is almost like it moisturizes it.  At any rate, I have finally found what I am looking for and it is organic as a bonus.  Love all Giovanni products. Note that I am picky about anything I put on my hair because having straight, blond hair, it can look greasy quickly.  This product does not give it a greasy look - only manageable."

It is not very expensive because it lasts a long time and doesn't take a lot of product to hold the style. It doesn't give a sticky feel or a heaviness to my hair. It doesn't make the hair feel stiff. In fact, I've often brushed my hair after using it and it still helps to maintain the new style created by brushing. It's a good product and not full of the chemicals that so many of the drug store or salon type hair sprays have in them."

I really liked the hold of the hairspray and the fact that it's a spray bottle. I really like Giovanni hair products but this one just did not agree with my skin. Shortly after spaying it all over my hair I got a nasty rash all over my neck, ears, and face. The rash was pretty bad my ears swelled up and they felt like they were on fire for a few days, also it itched pretty bad. I had recently tried out other products and I wanted to be sure this was the cause. I spayed some on my wrist and the next morning I woke up with the same type of rash. I have never had an allergic reaction to any products so this one is a first for me, not sure what ingredient caused the bad reaction."

I bought a 2 oz bottle at Pharmaca, and I used it right up, so I must like it. The hold is medium, and I had to rinse the nozzle a few times to make sure the spray comes out in a fine mist--no pump spray is quite as fine as an aerosol, but I don't like using aerosols for any reason.You can brush your hair after applying this hairspray and it's still soft and manageable."

Maximum Hold Styling Spray, Retains Style and Adds Shine (Pack of 3)",3.0 out of 5 stars,good product - bad packaging,"Have been using Giovanni products for years and I keep buying them. BUT the pump spray is a challenge. The last LA Hold I bought didn't work at all, and I had to transfer the contents to the previous bottle. Good luck trying to get the top off!! Almost impossible! Same goes for their Shine. It is in a small square bottle that is hard to grip, and the last oneI bought also had a defective pump.  I don't like having to fight my pump spray."

Tall order - it is exactly all those things.  Love it!It doesn't have a stiff hold and won't hold a specific area (high bangs) - it's best for buildable body."

Maximum Hold Styling Spray, Retains Style and Adds Shine (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, an organic hairspray!","I've been searching for an organic/safer hairspray product for a few years now and am so glad I found this. It gives great hold to my thin, fine, straight, medium-length hair without breaking it or leaving it sticky-feeling. I checked out the ingredients on the bottle I purchased against EWG's Skin Deep database. All the ingredients are rated 2 or below (green), are organic, no phthalates, no parabens, and the company is certified Cruelty Free by Leaping Bunny (<...>). Others have posted that this product gets an EWG rating of 5 (yellow), but check the ingredients for yourself. My label lists three chemicals that are not organic plant extracts: SD Alcohol-40B, Acrylates/Hydroxyester Acrylates Copolymer, and Aminomethyl Propanol. These each get an EWG rating of just 2 (green), so I'm happy."

When I became pregnant, I went on a search for an organic non-toxic hairspray.  I tired several organic non-toxic products and this product is the only hairspray I found that didn't smell terrible and actually works!

First, there was no inside plastic cover when you take the lid off. Second, there was a clear liquid around the edges that was never present before. Third, the consistency is not what it has been in the past. Almost thick lotion like, a bit silky feeling. Fourth, the hold is barely there. Before I left a review, I checked my local store (they carry it, but more expensive), and it was as it always has been in the past, including the inside plastic cover. Not sure what's up with these two that I ordered, but I suspect they are not the real deal."

I mean zero.  I've tried using a little less, I've tried using a little more.  I've tried using it on wet/damp hair, I've tried using it on dry hair.  Nothing.  Just falls flat.I have a pixie cut, so I'm pretty sure my hair length isn't the issue.  Will not be reordering it.  Probably gonna toss it in trash.Also, there's separation occurring- there was watery liquid in my jar when initially opening it and that seems to be getting worse with time.I like that this product is made with better ingredients than other brands but it doesn't do what I bought it for.  I don't recommend it.  It won't do for your 'do"

I'm not sure if the seller made a mistake with storing it at a high temperature area or if the recent batch of the product was bad but the last 5 of them I ordered all had problem with grainy residue. There are grainy bulks of the material that will not spread out and will leave highly noticeable white residue on your hair.At first I thought it was just a defective item but the the next order was the same. I then switched the seller and ordered two and again same white residue issue. I stopped ordering for 3 months and tried ordering again and the item I received still had same issue. I wasted $40 but kept ordering because I liked this product so much... Now I have moved on to a different product.

It adds just the right amount of hold to keep my hair in an intentional, stylized look instead of what it would normally do on its own (fluffy). It provides the benefits of the day after I wash without the possibly greasiness - adds a little weight and a little texture and definition; easy to target to where I need it. I don't use perfumed products normally and the smell of this is very light and does not register for me."

I like Giavanni Styling Glue because of its gentle ingredients but I feel like I really need to use a lot to get the piecey look to my hair. If I'm not messing with my hair all day it holds but if it's touched a lot (windy day or if the kiddos are climbing on me) it seems to ""disappear."" On the other hand, it washes out very easily and is definitely a matte finish which I love.Overall it's a decent product considering how limited natural hair styilng products are.

My scalp itched with many other products, but rarely at all with this one.  Good hold, very light that doesn't leave your head feeling gross like many other products.  Don't really need a lot of it, just the size of a dime rubbed throughout your hands and fingertips.  Depending on the look you're going for, you'll get a more full look if your hair is drier.  Generally in my experience and opinion paste like this is better for shorter spikier hair.  I think it looks better for that.  I use this when my hair is shorter, otherwise, I prefer hair spray when a bit longer which keeps a slightly nicer wet look that I can shape out of the shower and then just use hair spray to hold that in place.  Paste requires you to style and it holds to that style then."

I used it on the sides and edges a bit as well. Not as strong as a typical edge gel but it is a worthwhile compromise. Will buy more as soon as I need to. My hair is natural, but bleached and dyed. No relaxer."

Adds Separation to Shape Smooth Texture for Ease of Use Washes Out Easily No Parabens Color Safe, Multi, Styling Glue, 2 Ounce",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Texture and hold - no. Frizz control, probably.","For some background/context, I only shop vegan and cruelty free products and always go for a matte clay or pomade with medium-high to high hold. I have very fine hair that is naturally straight and doesn't like to hold any shape.I tried this product just for something different and it is not for me. There appears to be glitter in it?? It has a gel-like texture both in the jar and once dry in my hair. I almost always put use it after my hair is dry, but have tried also tried it when damp (allowed to air dry) and damp then blow dried. It does not off much for hold or texture and basically just makes my hair look greasy.If you like gel and don't need much of a hold (like maybe it's good for frizz control for curly hair??) then try it. Otherwise, if you're similar to me and want to add definition and texture, don't get this."

It's barely half full. I'm not going to scoop the product out to weigh it to see if it matches the weight shown on the container - but it certainly did not meet my expectations. I gave it 2 stars only because I like the product - but the quantity is ridiculous. Will not buy again.

It has a very light hold, dries well (not shiny) and never flakes. It's perfect to add a texture and a little body to your hair, without making it stiff. I wouldn't recommend it for spiking or any hairstyles that need to stay in a perfect position. As an added bonus it smells really nice!"

It doesn't have much of a scent & the scent I do detect isn't that great. The product is VERY sticky & a little goes a long way, which is great actually. I don't mind using it on the tips of my hair for added texture but I have to be conscience of using VERY little or my hair will just be ruined & would need to be rewashed. I recently got a shag haircut & wanted/needed some texture so I thought this would help. Honestly, I can only use it on my ends, not my entire hair so I won't be purchasing again."

I have thinning short hair and so I was looking for something that doesn't have a harsh chemicals and is natural but still provides good hold.The consistency of the pomade is a little bit more sticky than what I would consider a true pomade, but it works just as well. If you're going for a spikey and shiny look, I would suggest applying the product to damp hair. If you're going for more of a more full and wavy hold, it's best to rub and spread a lot of the product in your hands before applying to dry hair.It's great that it washes out easily and doesn't leave your hair feeling coarse, unlike most styling waxes and pomades that have harmful chemicals."

On the basis of my thick straight Asian hair, I can honestly say that this vegan pomade would not give you hair styles with volume (i.e. quiff, pomp,); however, it can give you a decent slick-down side parts when used on towel-dried hair. Another thing to consider is that this product is fairly easy to wash out (for the people who likes water soluble) and it does get sticky when you emulsify it with your hands. Overall, it is decent ""organic"" styling product, with the focus of paraben-free.It is a 50/50, as I can only recommend this if you are green-conscious; otherwise, I would encourage the other half to check out other styling products without petroleum, paraffin, beeswax, mineral oil, and heavy silicones.

I also wanted something fairly cheap and water based so I didn't have to shampoo my hair every day and have it be really shiny. Unfortunately the hold on this stuff is way too light. If you use enough of it, it will keep your hair from getting frizzy or flying away but for the most part, it smells and feels closer to a leave in conditioner or a light gel than a pomade. The smell is clean but too much fragrance, I can see myself getting sick of it really quick. I guess this is geared more towards women, but at the same time you'd have to use a lot of it for long hair. This stuff is best if you have shorter hair or are simply looking to control frizzy, dry hair...other than that it's not much of a pomade. You gotta spend more for the good stuff."

It's doesn't hold up hair or dry very well. It's also a little shimmery. If you are seeking a matte finish to your hair. I would suggest you try the Giovanni styling glue. If not look for a reformer . FYI this product is not waxy its goopy.

This has no hold,"I'm a guy with short-medium long hair. I previously fell in love with American Crew Fiber. American Crew Fiber is amazing - it has fantastic hold, a matte finish, still allows you to change your hair anytime, and washes out easily. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it has many not-so-natural ingredients, which is why I wanted to try the Giovanni Wicked Texture Pomade. I also bought ""Giovanni styling glue"" because I couldn't make up my mind. Buy the Giovanni Styling Glue - it has tons more hold than the ""wicked texture"" and it still has the matte finish. Do not buy this (your hairstyle will collapse/change within 30 minutes) buy the styling glue instead - lasts all day and matches American Crew Fiber in terms of making your hair look awesome - only with natural ingredients!"

Shines good. Would be a good product for thick curly hair. For my very fine hair it was a disaster. I styled my hair and sprayed the shine. It soaked and flattened my hair. I tried a lighter touch on the other side. Same results. I decided to use it as a conditioner and it worked somewhat. For fine hair this product is a no. For straight or frizzy or curly hair I would give it a try.

But Giovanni Shine of the Time gave me nothing more than a flawless, frizzless look and I love it!The scent is okay, nothing crazy strong and it’s not unpleasant. But guys, the second I spray this on (I just directly spray my hair like 3-5 times) my hair melts into the softest, most tangle-free head of hair you’ve ever see.  Love it!"
6,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny Hair,"I like the impression of healthy shiny hair.  I have mixed feelings about putting silicone on my hair. Further, I prefer to be able to touch my hair and have it feel soft and giving.  I don't have that feeling.  It is not hard or crusty, but I feel a coating.  I just don't feel a touch of shine is a good trade off for the way my hair feels and the unknown effects the application may produce on my hair.  Further, I suspect I am losing manageability of hair styling as soon as I apply comb, brush, or pik to the hair.  It becomes straw-like, almost inflexible.  The final decision has not been made, but I am leaning heavily to discontinuation.  It is all very subtle differences, but they are there.  The shine is NOT spectacular.  07/23/21"
7,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silky lightweight sheen for curly hair,"It’s an oil spray, so if your hair just doesn’t like oil, abort this mission now. I have thick curly coily 3c hair and when I’m pushing back on wash days, a light misting of this on curls makes them look shiny and new again. I use this after each wash, or in between when I’m refreshing curls with conditioner. If you have fine or lightweight Caucasian hair, give it a try but not too close to bedtime. I think it might come off on your pillow case if not given enough time to absorb throughout the day. It’s lighter than olive oil sheen spray or than hair polish, if that’s helpful, and a little goes a LONG way. Mild but definite salon-product-type scent, which fades quickly:Pic taken 6days after last wash🤪"

It is a little greasy but I only use it on my ends and I tend to use it when I wash my hair at night so it can really saturate into my ends and then it's a little less greasy feeling.

9,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,nice gloss and softness,One word of warning- if you spray too much it will weigh your hair down. I bought this to add a little shine as well as soften hair. I use a hair straightener a few times a week and this really helps with two things. It 100 percent does add shine once you have straightened your hair and it softens the texture to make additional straightening easier. I also use this by spraying a little on my brush and then applying. I also apply this to my brush when my hair is wet and let it air dry. Shine is great and so is the softness.

But Too Much Can Get Greasy Fast!,"I'll start off by saying this product DOES work. However, too much makes your hairy instantly greasy... and too much is very easy to achieve. Just one spray sprayed too close can be a disaster. I find myself having to mist from far away and sort of ""walk through"" the mist in order to achieve a shine that doesn't look heavy and greasy. For all the work it takes to make sure this product doesn't make my hair look greasy, I'd probably just order something else in the the future."

18,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Use sparingly,"The first bottle I received was completely empty as it leaked all over the box as well as everything in the box. This item is not refundable but Amazon replaced the empty bottle.  I really like this product when spritzed lightly, too much and my hair looks oily. It adds just enough shine and tames my fly aways as well as being very lightly scented.  Great product, affordably priced and lasts a long time since a little goes a long way! I recommend this!"
19,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Hair Product I've Ever Used!,"This review is for 'GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist''. I am white and have had thick, wavy, somewhat coarse hair which I've always worn long. As I'm going gray it's getting coarser. Using Shine of the Time gives my hair a similar look to a professional keratin treatment but without the permanent straightening so I maintain my hair's natural wave. It is also the best detangler product I've ever tried."

One has to spray it in the air and walk through the mist!!! Of course the oil goes all over the floor, counters, whatever! Don't purchase if you don't want to have a mess on your hands!!!"
22,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hassle of purchasing again!,"Not worth the hassle of purchasing again!There was no lid on the product, no seal with less then full appearance of the quantity in the bottle, who knows what is in the bottle that I received.  At the price that I paid and the wait I endured for the shipment to come in, I’m better off going to a thrift store and hoping to run across a discounted bottle in the same condition, by going to a thrift shop searching and destroying for a remnant of the product, at the very least I’d know that I am receiving a true remaining scrap of the real mccoy!"

I like Giovanni silicone finishing mist because it leaves my brunette hair shiny after it's straightened. The product smells great and smells like an expensive salon spray. It's hard to handle with the small square bottle. I would prefer this in a skinnier bottle, but it's excellent. I use it fast and order it on Amazon because it's hard to locate in stores where I live. I would recommend this product to anyone who has brunette hair that gets straightened daily. I always get compliments on my hair and it's sheen. :)"

I can find it, on and off, at Whole Foods, which speaks volumes of Giovanni Shine of the Times. I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It arrived as promised in a secure package. Just spritz it up into the air over your hair and leave it alone  for 5-10 minutes. DO NOT attempt to run a comb or brush through your hair immediately after spritzing or you will have an oily mess. Go lightly at first, you can always re-spritz if you desire a little more shine."

163,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",2.0 out of 5 stars,won't spray a fine mist..thicker?,The product smells nice but I think the molecules are larger than other brands the sprayer sprays out in lump squirts I bought two bottles so it must be the sprayer on both bottles just squirts out large amount which of course looks greasy on your hair I tried putting the product in an other bottle that I know has excellent sprayer but the product still came squirting out so I think it's not as fine of a product at others it will not spray out of bottle as a mist.

My hair is very fine and walking under the mist did make my hair shine, however it also clumped the hairs together making them look wet.  Maybe this product would work better on thicker hair."

It does provide shine without drying the hair. I gave it 3 stars because while good it is not the kind of product that makes me want to use it daily. My hair is natural and I can get the 'shine' from my oils.
172,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scented,"I use a hair salon product but wanted to find something similar w/o the big pricetag from the salon!  This product is similar at a better price point, but it's SCENTED.  I can't use a scented product, first it would contain alcohol, which dries out your hair.  Not for me.  I wish it would come unscented."

And I found it in this product. I'll buy this again. It has a nice smell and gives your hair a great sheen, but be careful not to spray too much or you'll end up with oily hair. Less is best and you won't need much anyway with this product. It provides great coverage!"

Ever since TIGI Shine Spray was discontinued, my hair has been rough and frizzy in Florida humidity. I picked up this product locally and was amazed at how smooth and shiny my hair looks every time I use this product, even when it’s humid! And my blowout and straightening looks great even the next day. If you have a lot of fine hair that is voluminous when blow dried, spray this on before straightening. You won’t regret it. I’ve stocked up on this product."

It does very little for a very little amount of time. Don't waste your money"
176,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super shiny results,"I’m the kind of person who has a bathroom littered with subpar hair and skin products I’ve bought, tested and found to have little value. This stuff is different. It has a solid spot in my hair routine. I typically shy away from silicone based products but I think for the purposes of a shine finishing spray it works well. I just mist a few pumps on my hair from a generous distance after blowing out/curling, I’ve had the same bottle a long time since you need so little. It has a really nice subtle clean smell that my boyfriend always comments on."
177,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great spray,"Was skeptical about putting silicones on my afro textured hair. I tried this out on freshly washed hair. Using a small section, I applied this spray. It dried my hair faster than the other sections and left that section both shiny and silky. I lightly sprayed the other sections afterwards. It yielded a great blow out and spared my hair from the flat iron. Plan to purchase again."
178,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,I always wear my hair up. My hair tends to be a little frizzy (depending on the weather or if I slept on it) and has some unruly strands but if I spray some of this on my pony tail it looks like I actually styled my hair to make a pony tail. I never use heat or style my hair :/ but when I use this it looks like I took the time to do my hair. Oh and it smells nice
179,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best quality shining product I've found!,"I have used this product for 12 years.  I've  found no other product like it, as it's lighter and non-tacky.  A little goes a long way, so a bottle lasts quite awhile."
180,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product! I can't find it anywhere except Amazon at this point.,"I love this product, and I can't find it in stores anymore.  One bottle lasts forever so when I realized I was low and couldn't find it, of course I turned to Amazon!The one tip I have is to spray it on a brush and brush it through your dry hair rather than spraying it on your hair directly.  Spraying directly applies too much and my hair looks awful.  Using it on my brush is perfect! It knocks down the fly aways and smooths out my hair.  I just love this stuff!"
181,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",3.0 out of 5 stars,three stars,I like this product. It gives a good shine. I am giving it only three stars because the pump spray is awkward and difficult to use. The square design makes it difficult to grab the bottle if you don't have giant hands. Go back to the drawing board!!

187,"GIOVANNI Shine of the Times Finishing High-Gloss Hair Mist, 4.3 oz. - Smoothing Anti Frizz Hair Gloss, No Parabens, Color Safe (Pack of 1)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny hair,"This product definitely leaves my hair shiny.  If I spray it too close to my head (less than 12 inches), then it leaves my hair a little bit on the greasy side.  So I try to spray it into the air and then walk into it.  I also noticed it transfers onto my skin leaving my face pretty oily.  I normally spray 3 sprays total each time (once on top, once on each side). I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so perhaps that's why it can at times weigh it down a bit.  It works great on my daughters hair who has much thicker and longer hair.  So I guess it depends on your hair type.  I still like the product, but I try not to spray it too much.  It does also help tame the frizzies a little bit.  Overall I'm satisfied with the product, you've just gotta figure out how to much use based on your hair type and length."

I have fine, short and prematurely graying hair (no coloring products).  It helps calming down the hair, get rid of the frizz right away and dryness . It washes well after 2 shampoo, which I use a shampoo bar (no poo method). This product is 100% natural. The ingredients in the picture mentions dimethicone, it is not correct. The actual label only lists out natural oils and nothing else. After washing, yes it leaves a very subtle film on the hair, but that’s how it gets rid of the frizz and continues to feed your hair. It is absolutely wonderful even after first use. Highly recommend it."

My hair gets a little wild when it air dries, and feels dry and brittle normally but it was soft and not as frizzy. I wish I would have taken a photo before straightening it, but this was the result after. I rarely straighten my hair but when I did it never came out nearly as shiny or silky as it did this time.

I made a mistake of buying 2 bottles from 2 different listings... and both are NON-refundable.  The second one, I didn't even open the bag for.

I have heard such good things about this gel but from reading other reviews it seems like it's changed recently. It is VERY watery and left my hair just looking and feeling REALLY dirty with no hold whatsoever. My waves and curls were limo, stringy, and I had to wash my hair again the next day when I usually can go 3-4 days. This product isn't returnable, either, so there goes that money.

The gel had a strong, alcohol like smell when applied (it goes away after). Not sure why because I believe it's alcohol free. It smelled a little like bug repellent. The worst part though is that when applied onto damp hair and scrunched in, it left big, dry, white flakes and goop once completely dry. It left my hair looking a little crispy, even after ""srunching out the crunch."" When I  dry brushed my hair, the flakes went flying all over. Very odd.

I have thin straight hair and this truly does help to give it more body and helps hold the curl in a little longer.

I have air dried my hair for years because most hair products create too much frizz when I used a diffuser. Not sure why Giovanni didn't give this product a better scent. The rubbing alcohol scent this product has is quite off-putting."

I blow it dry until it is slightly damp and then distribute a little more on my hands and into my hair, fluff out the hair and let it dry before smoothing it our with wide tooth comb or brush. My hair looks thicker and has has added texture all day long. I have not noticed any flakes, as others have mentioned. Perhaps that occurs when you use more of it. I use just a little."

The ones that I got before are from WholeFoods.  They work very well.  They hold my hair back, easy to clean, dry fast, and feel good.  They are like paste.  Thick.  This one I got from Amazon is totally different.  It is so thin that it comes out from the tube like liquid.  When applied to hair, it is very slimy and dry fast.  It is so slimy that even I took a shower, it does not wash away.  I use my hands to apply it to my hair.  Afterwards, I have to scrub hard to get the slimy off my hand.  The ones I bought before from WholeFoods easily wash off.  No need to scrub.  This product dose hold well.  It is so strong that it is as hard as a piece of plastic on my hair.

I have very long hair and I only use two large pearl size dabs. The hair should be just towel dried, or not dripping wet. I usually wet one hand and rub the dab between my hands and fingers. Then I start lightly spreading it through my hair. This is not a holding gel. This will make your hair feel thicker and more manageable. You can re-activate it the next day by spritzing it with water. USE SPARINGLY. If you have shoulder length hair or shorter, this bottle should last you 2 or 3 months."

It actually did the opposite!! Do not buy!!,Do not buy if you are looking to add volume to your hair. This is sticky and weighs hair down. Complete waste of money

This is much thinner consistency and when it dries and I run a comb through my hair, the comb is full of a fuzzy residue.  It doesn't hold the set."
103,"GIOVANNI More Body Gel, 6.8 oz. - Volumizing Style, Hair Thickener, Plumps Hair, Seals Split Ends, Adds Shine, Paraben-Free, Color Safe",5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite,This is my favorite hair gel. I have loose curls and this gives some super hold to them when I diffuse and even after I get the crunch out. This version is more liquidy and easy to spread and they have another one that's thicker but both give amazing hold and aren't flaky when dry. I love trying new hair products but I always come back to this gel. It's just that good.

Volumizing Style Gel, Hair Thickener, Plumps Hair, Organic Proteins & Botanicals, Seals Split Ends, Adds Shine, Paraben Free, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",3.0 out of 5 stars,"This gel does form a cast and is one of the best ""more natural"" options I've found","That being said, though it works pretty good at holding my 2b curls, I can't shake that it makes my scalp itch. If I were to wash my hair daily, I don't think it would bother me, but as many of you with curls know.. that's a royal pain and I usually wash every other or third day. This really starts to itch and make my scalp flake. The gel itself doesn't flake off of my hair, but after using this for about a year, I'm going to have to try and find something comparable. It's so hard to find a good holding gel that is more natural. Most make my hair feel horribly greasy, and I have relatively dry hair and a super dry scalp."

I have long fine hair and recently lost a lot due to a thyroid condition. People comment on how thick my hair is all the time when I use this. I think it helps with keeping curl in my hair too.

To the person that mentioned the 'white flakes' from the product,  you probably used too much of it.  A little goes a long way..and I put the majority of the product on the underside of my roots, blowdry upside down, and this keeps my hair full looking all day long."

Volumizing Style Gel, Hair Thickener, Plumps Hair, Organic Proteins & Botanicals, Seals Split Ends, Adds Shine, Paraben Free, Color Safe (Pack of 3)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Does add body to my fine hair!,"I've been using this product for the past year or two and really like  it! I can't explain the white flakiness described by another review, but this is one of the only products that has actually had a positive effect on my fine, straight hair. It took me a bit to figure out the best ratio for me, but for my just-past-shoulder-length hair I find that between a quarter to half-dollar size amount is good -- I flip my head over and focus on the 2"" or so closest to the scalp (although it does get through the rest of my hair as well). I typically blow dry my hair after that, although not always.The thing I really like about this gel is that it adds body and some hold without any stickiness or stiffness. I have used this in conjunction with 

Beauty Without Cruelty Volume Plus Spray Gel 8.5fl oz

   with great results (using the Giovanni closer to the roots and the BWC for the rest), but this Giovanni is the one I use every day without fail."
