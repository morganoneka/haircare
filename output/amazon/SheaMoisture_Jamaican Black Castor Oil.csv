0,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Made my course wavy hair manageable.,The Shampoo alone will soften your hair. Will have to wash twice the first time because it does break down all the old waxes you have in your hair and it will not suds up . the second wash will have lots of suds. The conditioner is very good and a little goes a long way. I love the Styling lotion that comes with this set. A small amount will keep your hair soft and manageable.
1,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil set comes with three products: Strengthen & Restore Shampoo, Strengthen & Restore Conditioner, and Strengthen & Restore Styling Lotion. All are made with a number of wonderful oils and other ingredients that are beneficial to hair. The shampoo is a dark brown liquid with a scent that reminds me of vanilla extract, a smell I love. The conditioner is a much thicker, about the consistency of pudding, and is light brown in color. It smells different than the shampoo, but equally as wonderful. The styling lotion is a light golden color and has a consistency about halfway between that of the shampoo and the conditioner. It doesn't smell as good to me as the shampoo and conditioner do, but it's still okay. All three of these products leave my hair very soft and manageable. I like these three items not only for their ingredients, but for what they don't contain: no sulfates, no parabens, no phthalates, no mineral oil, and no petrolatum. The shampoo and conditioner are each 13 fl oz (384 ml), and the styling lotion is 8 fl oz (237 ml). This set of three products currently lists for $30.11, which I consider very reasonable."
2,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"SHAMPOO:The shampoo is pretty thin, so be careful with how you handle it. This shampoo is one of so very few shampoos that hasn’t made my hair mad. My hair actually likes this stuff. It will more likely than not become my go to shampoo for the days when I shampoo.CONDITIONER:This conditioner was alright. Not as good for my hair as the shampoo...but not nearly as icky as the styling lotion. I’ve had better and worse conditioners. This wasn’t really special in any measurable way. I doubt I would get this again. It’s not bad...it’s just also not good for my hair.STYLING LOTIONThis left my hair sticky and smelling powerfully weird. It latched onto any dust in the air that it came into contact with. This left my hair so dirty and gross that I had to wash it twice just to get everything out. That’s really saying something because I don’t really need to wash my hair that often.WOULD I BUY THIS SET AGAIN?No. I would not buy this set again. I would like to get JUST the shampoo, since it’s the only one in the set that I actually really liked."
3,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have long, curly, chemically dyed hair that tends to get very dry if I don't use the right products on it. Even shampoos and conditioners that are advertised as moisturizing often dry my hair out.First of all, I love the SheaMoisture brand. It's great for dry hair.This particular shampoo/conditioner/styling product is wonderful.The curls you see in the picture are 100% natural. I washed my hair, used the conditioner, towel dried my hair then let it dry naturally. Then I put a tiny bit of the styling lotion to give it a little body.So, this trio is easy on the hair and brings out your natural curls.If I had really made an effort to style my hair, this product would have done a great job.Also, my hair feels very soft. The scent of the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream ( it's not a gel) is soft and subtle,  nice, not overpowering."
4,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As usual, Shea Moisture really shines at getting a scent that is wonderful!  This one is very pleasant smelling!  As for the products - you know, the shampoo/conditioner/styling lotion - I found that, for the price (currently just under 32 bucks), means that each bottle is about ten dollars, and for that price, you could do a bit better in quality depending on your needs if you wanted something more specific.  For us, we tend to lean more to the natural side of things, which this product, outside of the shea butter itself and some oils, is not.  The shampoo does have a nice lather and rinses easily, and the conditioner and styling lotion are equally good products - just not premium products, at least in our mind.  (Only mentioning it because they don't quite have the premium price, but are certainly close!)  Not bad stuff, would recommend to most folks."
5,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the natural ingredients used in these products. I primarily ordered them due to the clean ingredients, but I may keep ordering them for how well they work and for the fantastic scent! They smell absolutely lovely! I would bottle that scent and wear it as perfume! The products do a great job getting the hair clean while leaving the natural moisture. My toddler has curly hair and I'm always on the hunt for products that keep her hair moisturized and yet aren't full of a bunch of sketchy ingredients. This definitely fits the bill! I love the leave in conditioner included. That is an absolute must for my daughter's hair or it just looks super dry again in no time. It really seems to seal in the moisture well."
6,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My hair tends to be rather dry and thin/fine, so for shampoos I need something that actually delivers on promises of moisturizing. This wasn't my first go-around with SheaMoisture. I've used some of their body soaps and face cleansers before, and I've generally enjoyed each product, so it wasn't a surprise that I'd like this set of shampoo/conditioner/styling lotion as well. The shampoo and conditioner did a good job of giving my hair feel softer, fuller after a couple weeks of use. The styling lotion works, but I found the holding strength not quite enough for me. I do like the scent though, as faint and fleeting as it is."
7,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have very curly hair that’s just past my shoulders and we have a variety of hair types in the family. Although I try to pull out from the sets the ones that are curly girl approved, not all of SheaMoisuture products are, the only one in the set is the Shampoo.I love the conditioner. I wash my hair daily but don't apply shampoo more than 1-2 times per week so it doesn't dry out my hair. The styling cream is a lite hold.I’ve used several of the SheaMoisture products and have had great success without spending a ton of money."

9,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Generally, I do not use shampoo often because it is so drying.  This shampoo is not drying at all.  It is gentle and moisturizing.  It does have a scent but the scent is not strong and fades quickly.  The styling lotion is ok -  I need to use this with another product on my hair but I rarely can get away with a single styling product.  The more I try this line, the better I like it."
10,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The shampoo made my extremely thick, curly hair, look and feel even thicker. I needed my husband to squeeze the conditioner bottle. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get any product out. Yes, I have arthritis in one hand, but this is the only bottle I couldn’t manage to successfully maneuver.  The styling lotion was fine. No better nor worse than any other products I use."

This shampoo is great for dry hair.  It leaves the hair soft and manageable.The scent is awesome.  I have asthma so I’m very particular with scent.  This scent is not overwhelming.It doesn’t bother my asthma.This is a good trio with shampoo, and conditioner. Plus a good styling lotion for curly hair."
12,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",2.0 out of 5 stars,SMELLS TERRIBLE BUT MAKES HAIR SOFT,"I like how nice and soft the hair came out after use of the shampoo and conditioner and lotion but the smell was so bad in my opinion, so I’m torn .. for me the smell needs to be fixed somehow and this would be a great product!"
13,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes love the bundle I have used this brand for about 7 years while going natural and no complaints
14,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like that the scent of this set is mild as I don't like a lot of fragrance in my products. However that said, ""fragrance"" is one of the top ingredients in the set which can be irritating for my skin. So far I have not had any problems with itchy scalp using this product. I do choose to follow up with either hair oil or leave in conditional as my bleached ends really need it, this set alone doesn't alleviate it by itself."
15,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,I am not a fan of this company and their products. They claim to moisturize and soften hair but they leave my hair dry (I have tried most of them on my natural hair). This was one of the first products I used from this company that actually made my hair soft and moisturized but it did not last long. When you dry your hair it returns to being very dry and brittle. There is a false sense that it is working but once your washing is completed you realize that it was just an illusion. This set doesn’t seem to work for me but it may work for others. There is something in it that doesn’t agree with my hair.
16,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Styling Lotion for Curly Hair Mixed Hair Care Regimen with Shea Butter 3 count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells great and left my hair manageable and soft,"My hair is really curly and super dry and always in need of more moisture so this set from SheaMoisture has been great. The shampoo didn't dry my hair out at all and lathered up and rinsed out well. After that I applied the conditioner, which was really thick, but was easy enough to apply and I let it sit for five minutes before rinsing. My hair felt really soft after rinsing it out and after that I styled my hair with my usual products and added the styling cream to my routine. After using all of the products, my hair dried really well with much less frizz and it feels noticeably softer. It has a very light scent, nothing too intense. Overall, this is great for anyone with curly dry hair."
0,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,After having covid I had suffered significant hair loss 😞 the first use of this shampoo and conditioner I was amazed!  no hair falling out & wrapped around my fingers while washing with it and very little hair shedding when drying it .. my hair felt soft and laid nicely
1,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my hair,Not a terrible shampoo but my hair remains dry after shampooing and conditioning. The leave in shampoo smells like playdough which I actually find oddly pleasant but I’ve been using for over 3 weeks 1-2 times a week and my hair still seems so dry.
2,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",4.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente,Los productos llegan muy bien empacados y sellados sin riesgo a qué se rieguen. Estoy usandolos hasta el momento me ha gustado como queda mi cabello.
3,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using castor oil for years and I can truly attest to the benefits this oil offers.  Black Castor Oil is a hair strengthener and combined with Shea Butter is such a great combination! So when I stumbled across these products, I had to have the collection.This Shea Moisture Strengthen & Restore collection includes 13oz Shampoo, 13oz Conditioner and also a 12oz Strengthen & Restore Masque.The shampoo with Peppermint Oil made my scalp feel tingly while my hair felt so refreshingly clean. Now both conditioners left my hair feeling so soft and shiny. My hair suffers from heat damage so it’s dry & dull. But the conditioners, left my hair feeling moisturized, more manageable and it also smells AMAZING.These products did exactly what I needed them to do so I highly recommend these products."
4,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Leaves my hair soft, squeaky clean, and perfectly balanced!","I have used several SheaMoisture products in the past and have always been pleased with them. This set of Strengthen and Restore products sounded like they were right up my alley as my hair is fine, thin, and slightly damaged.If you have super dry hair, these may not work for you. I have combination hair (oily roots and dry ends) and don't need a ton of moisturizing. These products worked well for my hair type. If you need intense moisture, your hair may be left feeling too dry.In this bundle, you get a shampoo, conditioner, and masque. I rarely use masques because my hair normally doesn't need a ton of moisturizing but I decided to give this one a try to see how well it worked on my hair.I was intrigued by the color of these products. I'm used to white and clear colored haircare products. These are actually dark brown and like a caramel color. I have light blonde hair so always worry about color being deposited on my hair but that definitely didn't happen.All of the products smell fantastic! I can smell all of the ingredients! The end result is pleasant and fresh smelling.The shampoo lathers nicely and leaves my hair feeling squeaky clean without being stripped of moisture.The conditioner coats my hair nicely and really works into my dry, brittle ends. It was a little difficult to squeeze out of the bottle, especially as the bottle got emptier and emptier. However, it rinsed out of my hair well and didn't leave it feeling slick or coated. My hair felt so soft and hydrated. It isn't a super moisturizing conditioner and didn't leave my hair feeling weighed down after drying.The masque is something I would use once a week or so, maybe once every 10 days. I apply the product and leave it on for about 15 minutes or so before rinsing. It is difficult to rinse but does leave my hair feeling SUPER hydrated. It is too moisturizing for me to use on my roots. I tried it the first time and it left my roots feeling too oily for my liking but it works great for my dry ends!"
5,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have thick curly hair that is prone to breakage and after using all 3 products consistently have been happy with the results. After shaping my hair is always very frizzy and dry for the next few days which has always annoyed me because I cant shape it how I want. However with the hair mask that dry hair is gone a lot quicker. It also does a great job at adding volume to my curls.  Before my hair would show signs of curling but still lie fairly flat. After only a few days of using this product, my hair has so much more volume and much better curls. I love the ingredients they use, things like castor oil and shea butter plus the products even look natural because they are brown and black just like I would expect them to be not some weird white slime. The main issue I have had is with the shampoo, one of the main things I was looking for was a product that could decrese breakage. When I use the included shampoo I feel as if I had just as much or even more breakage than I did before. As soon as I substituted it out for a different shampoo I started to notice a decrese in breakage. Obviously everyone's hair is different so I may have just been unlucky with the shampoo but the masque and conditioner still work great so I would definitely recommend trying the product out and being open to experimenting like I did to get the best results."
6,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a pretty good product, but the ""package"" is where it falls down a little for me.  First - the products work as you would expect with a possible exception of the color of the stuff (not super attractive) and the texture (same).  But once using it, it gives good results and smells quite nice!  In fact, the scent is probably my favorite part.Looking at competitors - they perform just as well and come in different (and equally pleasant) scents - so one isn't really better than the other.  However, give this is a package - at the current price, each item is here averages over $8...which assumes each is equally priced, which it's not likely to be.  For me - I value some parts of this more than others.  (Also - at time of this review, the shampoo is available for exactly $4 - it says it's usually $10, but it's difficult to determine how true that may be.)  So right now, I could buy this kit cheaper separately.If you really want each item in the package it may be a great deal (maybe...), but otherwise, you may be spending a bit more for a 3rd item you may not use much.  So overall - pretty good product, could be bought individually for less expensive right now (and you'd pick all 3 items yourself)...so I'm not super fond of the package itself."
7,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Most Shea Moisture hair care products are geared towards curly hair, and this line is one of the ones that can be used by everyone. This isn’t my first time trying the shampoo and conditioner in this set, I have used it in the past, but it is my first experience trying the masque!None of these products in the SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo smell good, they all have a weird scent that’s not horrible but also doesn’t make me want to use it. But it does do a good job of strengthening like it claims! Anyone that’s used strengthening products knows that they usually are not the most hydrating products. They tend to leave your hair feeling a bit dry and even sometimes brittle. But they do a great job of strengthening in the long run. And this set is no different.I would recommend this to anyone that has lots of split ends, or dry and brittle hair. But I also wouldn’t recommend using this set daily. I like to use this every other shampoo, this way I am getting some of the benefits, without my hair getting to dry and gross feeling."
8,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I got this for my daughter-in-law, and the following is her review:This Shea Moisture Shampoo, Conditioner, and Masque set is a great value, priced at roughly $24.22. The products smell great as they are made with Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Shea Butter, and Peppermint to give them their fantastic scent. They are designed to strengthen and restore damaged hair and soften and improve its texture. I like Shea Moisture as a brand as they are known for formulating products that are paraben, sulfate, and phthalate-free, as well as color-safe. After using all three products in a row, my hair now feels refreshed and given its life back. The shampoo lathered well, created nice bubbles, and was a good consistency. The conditioner was great at giving my hair some moisture, but the leave-in masque was the ultimate treatment that improved my hair, making it feel softer and silky smooth to the touch. I give this product 5 stars, as it's priced well and works great for my hair care needs."
9,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My hair is 4C natural and loves moisture.  SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque with JBCO is right up my alley.  It smells amazing.  Shampoo lathers rich once your hair is wet.  Lots of bubbles, which I love.  The mask (second pic) applies easy and you can start to see your real hair pattern.  I alternate washes with masque and conditioner.  I think the shampoo conditioning process was gentle on my hair and it came out really clean and fluffy.  Very strong too.  I had a lot of tangles, and my hair held up well to all the pulling and tugging needed to detangle.  However, after towel drying, I felt my hair was really dry.  I had to put a lot of moisture back in it.  It absorbed that moisture like a sponge.  So if you want gentle, harsh chemical free cleansing and conditioning, this kit does it well.  However, be prepared with some good leave in conditioner.  I used another Shea Moisture conditioner and I'm good to go."
10,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"If you like the smell of shea butter, that warm and slightly nutty fragrance, you're going to love this set. You're going to love it even more if your hair is in need of some serious softening.My favorite of the trio has got to be the strengthen and restore treatment mask. Like the other products, you can easily detect that shea butter scent.As you can see from the photo, it's super thick.Great for chemically damaged hair, hair that's fried from either color or anything else that makes it feel like straw.Contains castor oil, helpful in encouraging new growth.The shampoo is clarifying, so It really gets your hair ready for either the conditioner or the hair mask.After the clarifying shampoo treatment, your hair soaks up whatever conditioning product you use. I've been using the regular conditioner everyday, and the treatment mask every few days. My hair never been so soft."

So, when offered this set for an honest review, I couldn’t resist. This set includes the restore shampoo and conditioner, as well as a hair masque. You use the shampoo and follow it with the conditioner. Every two weeks I follow my wash and conditioning with the masque that provides you with a deep moisturizer. These products are creamy and lather well.  They also contain shea, castor and peppermint oil. The smell is pleasant - like almonds and apple cider. This shampoo and conditioner leaves my natural hair soft, manageable, with a little shine. These products do not contain parabens, phthalates, petrolatum or mineral oil. And finally, this bundle is reasonably priced (under $28) especially if you compare the price of purchasing them individually. Overall, I’d recommend these products in terms of price and results."

Went on very thick. Kept in my hair for 20 minutes before rinsing and was disappointed with results. My hair was more knotted and felt frizzy and drier than it did with just the conditioner.Overall happy with the product and would order again"
13,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore set has three parts: Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque. The shampoo comes in a 13 ounce squeeze bottle. It is dark brown and resembles soy sauce. The conditioner also is provided in a 13 ounce bottle. It is much thicker than the shampoo, resembling dark mustard. It is thick enough that I had trouble getting it to come out of its bottle. The masque also looks like pale mustard. It comes in a 12 ounce tub. The three share some ingredients including Shea Butter and Peppermint, which lends itself to a pleasant scent.I have used the three sequentially in the shower; first shampoo, then conditioner, and finally the masque. The result was pretty good. My hair was clean and shiny, but on the downside, I still had the winter frizzes. A little Argan Oil is all that is needed to take care of that."
14,"SheaMoisture Strengthen and Restore Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Care Regimen 3 count",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"The color in these bottles and tub is a turn off to me. I like my shampoo and cream rinse to be clear or creamy white--preferably clear. I was almost afraid this was going to change the color of my hair. However, the shampoo lathers up nicely with a white lather. The conditioner is not overly hydrating--just enough for my fine curly hair. I did not try the masque because I do not need intense moisturizing.I do like the results but the color of the product is such a turn off that this is not something I would order again. If it were not for the color, I would have rated this 4.5 stars. The Shea Moisture products are wonderful  but this ensemble is just not for me. Also, the current price of $23.49 ($27.63 minus 15%) comes to $7.83 per item."

I had to stop combing because I didn’t want to risk snapping strands of my hair. The conditioner was ok. My hair seemed more moisturized, however, it’s not the best moisturizing conditioner I’ve used. I like the mask the best out of all three of these products. The mask really seemed to deeply moisturize my hair. It left my hair looking good and my natural curls were well defined."

It didn’t weigh my hair down like a lot of others do. My hair felt so healthy after using this set. I did try the masque once and left it in for 15 minutes before you rinse it out.

When I got the product I noticed it came in a box stating it is a Unilever company; the same company that owns Suave, Dove, etc. I prefer to buy from small US businesses so I feel that the marketing and labeling is a bit misleading. With that being said, I do like the set. All three smell very nice and contain mostly natural ingredients without any of the ""bad stuff"".  The shampoo cleanses and lathers well. The conditioner and mask do leave my hair softer, smoother without sacrificing body and volume. It is great for my mature, graying hair. But I feel like the labeling leads people to believe it is a small business when it is only ""family founded"". I mean Walmart and McDonalds are as well so that doesn't mean much to me when I prefer to support actual small US businesses."

The worst part though is that I seem to be allergic to something that they put in their products and it makes my eczema on my hands flare up badly."

The Shea moisture formula has changed a lot over the years I thought I would give it another chance and it let me down once again. I have type 4 natural hair and this leave in did absolutely nothing good for my hair. It did the opposite of what it claimed it actually dried my hair out.

I thought this line was safe when they rebranded. It also runs more. I know theyre suppose to be considered a little inconsistent because its suppose to be natural but ive been buying this line for 9 years. Its the same if I buy it in stores. I really wanted to keep buying this line as i loved and always reccomanded it but I'll be changing my go to brand. Coconut and hibuscus line is still great.

9,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner for Over-Processed, damaged hair 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Soften and Detangle Hair 11.5 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for low porosity curly hair,"I have low porosity very dry hair and this product left it so oily that I thought it was going to leave stains all over my clothes and bedding. I had to wash my hair the next day. It is also suuuuuuper sticky and matted my hair. Just terrible. Overall, it’s a disgusting product that I wouldn’t recommend to anyone. The only positive thing I can say about the product is that it has a nice light scent.Of course, I don’t want to throw it away since I paid for it (and also don’t want to add to my carbon footprint), so I spoke to my stylist who told me to layer my hair with the product before I get into the pool and then the product will protect my hair from the chlorine. This is the second time that I have tried a moisturizing product besides shampoo from Shea Moisture. The other product that I had tried was the coconut and hibiscus curl enhancing smoothie. That product is also way too greasy and sticky. The only products that I can use from Shea Moisture are their shampoos. Ironically, their shampoos are excellent."

Of course I’ve tried everything else & after watching a video on the top 5 best leave ins (this product being one of them) I decided why not give it a try? I’ve tried everything else? After one use I notice a difference in that the frizz & dryness I’ve been experiencing for years was much better & my hair was softer & more manageable when blow drying & styling. I’m going to keep using this & hopefully it’ll keep doing it’s thing!
11,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner for Over-Processed, damaged hair 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Soften and Detangle Hair 11.5 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my Favorite Leave-Ins,"Loved this product. The scent is hit or miss with a lot of folks but I like the smell of Jamaican Black Castor. It also smells sweet but I can’t figure out if it’s a vanilla pudding scent or something else. The texture for this product is thick and a little goes a long way because it can be heavy if you are heavy handed with products. For my hair, it is best applied on wet or damp hair to get the best benefits on my 4A hair. The product is super moisturizing and the smell will linger in your hair for many days. Those who are transitioning will see the benefits because it will be a little strengthening to those tresses and will give your hair the shine and body to make it look vibrant and less damaged."

At its healthiest my hair is a solid 2C. My hair isnt super thin but it is easily weighed down, and products made for thicker and coarser hair don't usually work for me. I'm going back to this leave in after a few stints in trying other leave ins because it just works so well. My waves become healthier and tighter, and it feels like they actually soak up this product, when other leave ins seem to create a film on my hair without effecting how moisturized it is. I have dry, damaged hair and live at a high elevation and this helps keep my hair healthy and moisturized!"

My hair can get extremely frizzy and dry at times even with other leave in conditioners and smoothing serum, I have been very impressed by this one! It really calms down the frizziness and never looks greasy, even after reapplying it the next day. I'm not wild with joy about the smell, but it is not offensive at all and being that it's a natural product the smell goes away in around 10-15 minutes. My roommate really loves the smell, so please take my opinion with a grain of salt! I have already ordered a second container of this, by the way!"

It tends to be on the dry side and I have to use a LOT of product to keep frizz away.  I started using this about a month ago and when I got my hair colored yesterday, my cosmetologist was shocked at how silky and healthy my hair is.  Even when I don't dry my hair all the time, I still have dry ends.  I usually need weighted products to keep the volume of my hair under control but this just gives me beautiful curls.  This product combined with this hair dryer https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086LB62WK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  has completely changed my morning routine and saves me a LOT of time getting ready."

This product really does moisturize my very dry medium thickness hair without making it greasy. It also is a great detangler. It leaves my hair soft and gives it a nice sheen. It also helps tame frizz. I am trying to grow my hair very long. I really believe that this conditioner is going to really help with preventing breakage. A little goes a long way. I concentrate the product from the middle of my hair length downwards, and put a smaller amount above that. The smell could be better, but it is not as bad as some people are saying. It eventually fades to what I would maybe call a musky vanilla."

230,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner for Over-Processed, damaged hair 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Soften and Detangle Hair 11.5 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  I have been using this leave-in conditioner for at least 4 years now and it is hands down my absolute favorite.  I have fine thin hair that has a slight natural wave to it and I had a hard time finding a leave-in conditioner that provided good moisture without leaving my hair greasy or weighing it down.  This stuff exactly what I needed.  I divide my hair into two sections and use a small starting at the ends and work it up to about halfway.  I always let my hair air dry and this does a great job of providing moisture and also seems to add a bit of volume.  The smell is very nice, subtle and not overwhelming.  I would say a jar lasts me about half the year."
231,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner for Over-Processed, damaged hair 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Soften and Detangle Hair 11.5 oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil had me a little worried when I first opened it.  It smelled good right away but I noticed the seal had been ripped and that the white cover you peel off when you open it wasn’t glued on to the top.  I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt that the heat had caused this to occur but it did make me nervous to use it at first.  Just something for them to consider improving on.The product itself is interesting.  I was imagining more of a Shea coconut butter feel to it.  It has somewhat of that texture but a little more oil feel to it when it’s applied.  On my skin, it didn’t really absorb the way typical shea butter does.  It did moisturize my skin though but it left a little bit of that oily feel that didn’t quite dry.  I guess there’s a bit of a personal preference element to this product too.  I felt that it left my skin and particularly my hands too oily feeling.  I also used a very small amount so a little goes a long way with this product.  If this is a type of product you use often this jar will last a long time.  You can easily do your arms and legs with a small dab of it.The scent reminds me of vanilla and coconut.  It’s subtle once applied to your skin.  You certainly feel well moisturized after using it.  I just wish it soaked into my skin a little more than it did.  I think the price is decent for the amount of product you get.  Like I said though it’s a little suspect that the tamper-proof seal doesn’t seem to stay glued to the top when you first get it.  That is something I would highly recommend is reworked on this product just so the consumer can feel more confident in the product being safe."
232,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner for Over-Processed, damaged hair 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Soften and Detangle Hair 11.5 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,This made my hair fee! Really dry after application.,"I washed my hair with my usual professional salon brand shampoo and then applied this leave in to my towel dried hair.  I allow my hair to air dry and I wonder if that could be why my hair felt like straw once it finally dried completely.  Normally a leave in conditioner will make my hair feel so soft once its fully dried, almost too soft.  But that wasn’t the case here.I pretty much avoided my roots entirely when I applied this but found that my hair just 2 days later was greasy from root to end.  Which is not the norm for me at all (I can usually get by washing my hair just once a week, twice is an indulgence).I have long, black hair that is kinda wavy, kinda straight which I color monthly (roots only bc of those pesky gray buggers!).My hair has a tendency to feel dry/frizzy when I use products that don’t suit my needs.I won’t give up on this leave-in because I have had good results with this brand in the past.  I think I just need to find the right concoction to make this work for me.  Maybe a different shampoo or actually heat styling my hair would make a diff.I have to say that when I first opened the jar I was like OMG this smells so good!  Then when I applied it to my hair, the smell brought back memories of play time and blue playdoh (not a good thing).  But the smell did not linger.  It had zero smell shortly after application which IS a good thing.  It would be a total deal breaker if my head smelled like playdoh all day long.I hope my humble opinion has helped you in some way.Thank you for reading."
233,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner for Over-Processed, damaged hair 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Soften and Detangle Hair 11.5 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have long thick wavy box-dyed hair for reference. This leave-in conditioner is really nice, but takes some figuring out. I had a lot of trial and error before I landed on the right amount for my hair. I found that applying this conditioner to my damp hair was a little too risky. It’s easy to go overboard. I don’t know why the instructions say to apply a generous amount. When I did that, things always ended badly. Rather than scoop some out of the tub, I just tap my fingers in and use what sticks to my fingers. Focusing mostly on the ends and then brushing my hair to spread it around. If I try to spread it around with my fingers, it just ends with me using too much and having oily looking hair that looks like it needs to be washed. I really found that I had the most control with this conditioner when I applied it to my dry hair. So I apply a little bit while my hair is damp, and then go in with the rest after my hair has dried. It does a nice job of smoothing out frizz and tackling dryness. One more thing that I want to note is the scent. I was a little worried about the apple cider vinegar and peppermint, but I can’t smell them at all. I mostly just smell shea butter and it’s pretty mild. This isn’t a leave-in conditioner that will overpower the senses or compete with perfume. I’m really happy with this product now that I have figured it out for my hair type, but it did take a bit of learning before I got my desired result. And at the rate I am going through it, this tub will last me a very long time. Overall, it’s a very nice leave-in conditioner…just go light!"
234,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner for Over-Processed, damaged hair 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Soften and Detangle Hair 11.5 oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have naturally curly hair, and it can be unmanageable at times, which is very frustrating. I recently got it cut, and the hairstylist recommended that I invest in a good leave-in conditioner, which should make my curls more manageable and cut down on the frizz. I have been a follower of Shea Moisture for years and have tried other products from them, so I figured it was worth it to give their leave in conditioner a try - and I am so glad I did!This product has a firmer consistency than some of the 'smoothie' products I have tried - I appreciate this because it's easier to put on and doesn't make as much of a mess. The jar is generously-sized, as well. I use a generous portion, but since I have shoulder length hair, it's not a ton. I work it through my hair and then let it air dry.It definitely makes a difference. My curls are more manageable and less unruly. I am much happier about the looks and definition overall. I highly recommend giving Shea Moisture products a try. The ingredients are more natural, it is very easy on my sensitive skin, and they really do work. They are worth the money!"
235,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In Conditioner for Over-Processed, damaged hair 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil to Soften and Detangle Hair 11.5 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, I love the smell of this conditioner. Normally, I’m not fond of scented products, especially if they have even a hint of artificial fragrance as those trigger headaches. This conditioner, though, has a wonderful, natural scent that I like so much, I find myself opening the container just to sniff it. Trust me, that never happens. The scent is sort of vanilla, but not overly so, with just a hint of peppermint. On to the conditioner itself. The first time I used it I took the instructions to apply a generous amount too literally and ended up with far too much in my hair. It left a heavy, greasy feel; however, my hair styled well and had an incredible amount of volume. The next time I used less, still enjoyed the benefits of conditioned hair and lots of volume but without the greasy feel. I’ve learned I don’t have to use very much, even on my thick hair, so the tub is going to last a long time. I love this stuff!"

I used a scented mousse but couldn’t smell it at all because this product dominated it.  It is a great moisturizer, though, and makes my hair feel really soft. I’ve used this company’s Curl & Style Milk and like that scent, so it’s too bad they didn’t use that. That other product is really difficult to get out of the bottle, though, so I do appreciate this tub. It is large (20 ounces) and should last awhile. It weighs my curls down a little, so I don’t think I’ll use it every time, but I can definitely feel that it’s softer, whether I braid or curl it. I can even tell when it gets wet that it’s more moisturized. I like it and recommend it, even over the better smelling style milk (I’ll just use a perfume or something)."

The conditioner is a bit soupy , I feel to be in such a large, wide mouth container.I had very high hopes of the leave in conditioning my hair, softening, protecting.Using on damp hair, it spread well, seemed to absorb at first, and needing more .Seemed to be softening, but later when I wnet to scrunch a bit after hair dried, it wasa weird greasy yet hard feeling. Not crunchy, more like hardened grease.Looking at my ends later, they kept tangling and locking, and I could see breakage.I use oils, balms, and leave ins - but never really experienced something that starts out good ,and turns into zapping my hair.Maybe too much castor oil ??Sorry S.M.  this did not do it for me  :("

You get a nice size tub of it, 11 oz. Conditioner has Jamaican black castor oil in it plus peppermint, apple cider vinegar and organic Shea butter. You can smell the apple cider vinegar in it. Smells nice, very mild, not overpowering. Consistency of the conditioner is good, melts into the hair nicely. Ingredients look natural and the conditioner contains no sulfates, parabens, mineral oil, phthalates or glycol. Also no animal testing. Black castor oil has omega 3's in it, the peppermint invigorates the scalp and the Shea butter moisturizes nicely. I enjoyed using it- it feels good on, I like the result and it's all natural. You get a lot and a little goes a long way. Overall, a good conditioner."

It’s easy to scoop out and apply to the hair. The top unscrews so every last bit can be used without wasting any like in a squeeze bottle. I leave it beside the tub so when my little girl is done with her bath I put some on her ends that tangle easily. It’s softening and absorbs well in her hair. The scent is soft and smells like vanilla to me. It’s sweet and pleasant. Even after her hair has dried, you can still smell the leave in conditioner.  I also like to run her large tooth comb through her hair with the product in to really help cover all the strands. I have been pleased with the moisture this puts back into the hair.

This is more moisturizing than the other JBCO leave-in by SheaMoisture, but just barely.  I would say its just not moisturizing enough even in an optimal setting with my hair.  I could have clean hair that is misted with warm warm and my hair doesn't feel moisturized enough with just this.  I still have to use it with other conditioners and lotions.  My hair felt dry after I took my twist out down.  The twist out itself was OK, not the best, but not the worst, but my hair was just so straw like.  I wanted to wash my hair again and start over with something else.  I have 4C Low Porosity hair.

I have baby fine, shoulder length, straight hair. I color my gray (which is probably about 75%) so I have the added problem of flyaway, quirky gray hairs that stick out at weird angles. I have been searching for a product that tames my hair without weighing it down, and I have found it!First, on opening the generously-sized jar, I noticed the delicious fragrance! The natural ingredients combine to give this an almost cookie-like scent! It’s a really nice experience to smell this every day while I style my hair.The directions say to use a “generous amount.” I took this advice and used about 1/2 ping pong ball size the first time. Oops, much too much! This made it hard to dry my hair, and made my hair feel coated and look slightly greasy. It washes out easily and entirely. So, the next morning, I tried a fingernail-size dab. Perfect!I’ve been using this leave-in conditioner daily and have reaped several benefits. It does do what I have been searching for by taming the flyaway grays to the extent that it can. My bob style stays smooth and lasts longer. Fine side hairs don’t fly in my face nearly as often. My hair looks shiny and smooth and feels really healthy. I have a small area of ends that are heat damaged, and a tiny bit extra of this cream smooths this area and makes it unnoticeable.SheaMoisture has created an amazing cream that I will be buying on repeat!"

This is lightweight & leaves my hair every moisturized. I could go about 2 days without having to reapply any additional product in my hair, which is what I do on weekends. I don’t seem to need as much when compared to the lotion. I apply this after washing my hair & do not need to apply any other product in my hair except gel/mousse to my edge to prevent flyaway.MoistureIt moisture my hair very well & I don’t need to add any other oil or moisturizer. It also allows me to go longer (a week) before washing my hair. I use to wash my hair everyday to every other day. My hair feels moisturized without feeling greasy or oily.ScentThe scent is lighter than the lotion which can be unbearable. However, the scent is much lighter in the leave-in conditioner which I can tolerate & even enjoy as it’s light.BuildupI do not use this on my edge as I use gel as I find it doesn’t play nice with other products. If I put this on my edge & then apply gel, my hair gets white & flaky from product buildup.OverviewGreat moisturizer with a light scent. You do not need addition products in the hair."

First off, it smells so, so good - like a sweet smell that's somewhere between coconut oil, cocoa butter, and vanilla (it doesn't smell very strongly though, and the smell is totally gone once it dries). My hair honestly looks shinier and healthier than it did a few days ago when I started using this. I have pretty thin, caucasian hair, and using a dab on the lower half of my hair (mostly on the ends) is the perfect amount for me. I don't put any on my scalp since I don't want it to look oily. It really seems to have made a difference for me in the few days I've been using it, and I have tried a LOT of products with this same desired effect. I really like this product so far."

Well when I wet my hair, I noticed that I got my Shirley temple curls BUT about the last 3 inches of my ends were “Spidery”. I think I burned by accident. The rest of my hair had pretty curls but dead straight and stiff at the ends. I got this product and in a weeks time, my natural curls are coming back when I wet my hair.

We've been putting it in our daughter's hair before bed and again in the morning and it helps make the styling process much easier.Scent-  smells good, like a mild mix between shea and cocoa butter.

First thing I noticed was that it smelled like playdoh. After a 5 days it still smells like playdoh. I just bleached my hair and I was looking for a leave-in that moisturizes. Well my hair looks dull my ends are still dry looking (I know there’s no fixing that without a cut but some products can mask that) AND on top of everything I woke up one morning with the biggest knot I’ve ever had in my hair. My hair is wavy and does not usually knot. I’ve had my hair bleached for weeks now and I never had a knot like that until I used this product. I will continue to use since I did spend money on it and give it another try. But that playdoh smell might make me throw it out.

This product is NOT what it used to be. Originally, the 11oz JBOC leave in conditioner was very similar to the OG formula that used to come in the 16oz tub. My most recent batch, however, was NOTHING like the batch from 2018. The product used to be runny, but now it's borderline watery.  As a 3c/4a curly girl,my roots are often frizzy. The product that USED to make them shiny and wavy with hold only makes my hair brittle and undefined. Shea Moisture has pulled a Shea Moisture and changed the formula AGAIN. The ingredients list looks the same, but that doesn't mean anything. The ingredients can appear in the same order, but there could more or less of something. Do NOT buy. It's not the same anymore."

I use a very large dollop (covers the center of my palm) for my curly hair that is past my shoulders.  I add a little more to the ends after I work the first dollop through my hair with my fingers.  This leaves my hair very soft, but not sticky or greasy.  I highly recommend this for curly hair.  I like this better than the ""D. C."" brand name of leave-in I usually use.

But it is thinner and supposed to be leave in while the Queen Helene Cholesterol Cream is rinsed off.  I think it does nourish your hair but because it has a thicker cream consistency that you leave in, it does weigh your hair down.  As a result you really would not want to put too much on your hair or use it everyday.  It is good every so often for a deeper treatment.  Another this is that your hair also looks a bit greasy with it on."

I’ve received so many compliments on my curls since I started using it. I love it, it’s a nice light scent and your hair doesn’t dry stiff or crunchy.

Also, the price of shea moisture products are reasonably affordable compared to other curly hair brands so that's a plus."

I really wanted to keep buying this line as i loved and always reccomanded it but I'll be changing my go to brand. Coconut and hibuscus line is still great.

7,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love!,"Best leave in conditioner for my locs!!! Keeps them strong and healthy , especially after styling and maintenance. Wouldn’t dare use any other product !!!"
8,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly hair,I just started properly taking care of my curls so this is my first leave-in. It works great keeping my hair moisturized and healthy but the only thing I hate is the smell. It smells like cookies dunked in apple cider vinegar--a very weird combo but it is what it is
9,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for low porosity curly hair,"I have low porosity very dry hair and this product left it so oily that I thought it was going to leave stains all over my clothes and bedding. I had to wash my hair the next day. It is also suuuuuuper sticky and matted my hair. Just terrible. Overall, it’s a disgusting product that I wouldn’t recommend to anyone. The only positive thing I can say about the product is that it has a nice light scent.Of course, I don’t want to throw it away since I paid for it (and also don’t want to add to my carbon footprint), so I spoke to my stylist who told me to layer my hair with the product before I get into the pool and then the product will protect my hair from the chlorine. This is the second time that I have tried a moisturizing product besides shampoo from Shea Moisture. The other product that I had tried was the coconut and hibiscus curl enhancing smoothie. That product is also way too greasy and sticky. The only products that I can use from Shea Moisture are their shampoos. Ironically, their shampoos are excellent."
10,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Controls frizz & softens hair,My biggest regret is not trying a leave in conditioner sooner! Of course I’ve tried everything else & after watching a video on the top 5 best leave ins (this product being one of them) I decided why not give it a try? I’ve tried everything else? After one use I notice a difference in that the frizz & dryness I’ve been experiencing for years was much better & my hair was softer & more manageable when blow drying & styling. I’m going to keep using this & hopefully it’ll keep doing it’s thing!
11,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my Favorite Leave-Ins,"Loved this product. The scent is hit or miss with a lot of folks but I like the smell of Jamaican Black Castor. It also smells sweet but I can’t figure out if it’s a vanilla pudding scent or something else. The texture for this product is thick and a little goes a long way because it can be heavy if you are heavy handed with products. For my hair, it is best applied on wet or damp hair to get the best benefits on my 4A hair. The product is super moisturizing and the smell will linger in your hair for many days. Those who are transitioning will see the benefits because it will be a little strengthening to those tresses and will give your hair the shine and body to make it look vibrant and less damaged."
12,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent leave in conditioner!!,Leaves my hair moisturized and soft. Smells amazing and I definitely got the value for my bucks. I use this along with Bella Curls curling creme. It is amazing!
13,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go to leave in for wavy hair,"I am mixed white and latino/indigenous and have had wavy hair all my life. At its healthiest my hair is a solid 2C. My hair isnt super thin but it is easily weighed down, and products made for thicker and coarser hair don't usually work for me. I'm going back to this leave in after a few stints in trying other leave ins because it just works so well. My waves become healthier and tighter, and it feels like they actually soak up this product, when other leave ins seem to create a film on my hair without effecting how moisturized it is. I have dry, damaged hair and live at a high elevation and this helps keep my hair healthy and moisturized!"
14,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buy from the store,"Have used this product many times before from the store so I thought no big deal when I brought here. however, this batch smells just like clay, burned my scalp a little bit and is very watery. Not moisturizing at all! Did the process for return and they require you to return product. Please be careful because you do not know what people are doing to these products before returning. It's very easy to buy the reseal top and send to someone else."
15,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It does wonders for my coarse, wavy hair","When I comb it through properly, it makes my whole head of hair shiny and soft. My hair can get extremely frizzy and dry at times even with other leave in conditioners and smoothing serum, I have been very impressed by this one! It really calms down the frizziness and never looks greasy, even after reapplying it the next day. I'm not wild with joy about the smell, but it is not offensive at all and being that it's a natural product the smell goes away in around 10-15 minutes. My roommate really loves the smell, so please take my opinion with a grain of salt! I have already ordered a second container of this, by the way!"
16,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have for curls `,"My hair is super curly (think 80's spiral curls) and quite stubborn.  It tends to be on the dry side and I have to use a LOT of product to keep frizz away.  I started using this about a month ago and when I got my hair colored yesterday, my cosmetologist was shocked at how silky and healthy my hair is.  Even when I don't dry my hair all the time, I still have dry ends.  I usually need weighted products to keep the volume of my hair under control but this just gives me beautiful curls.  This product combined with this hair dryer https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086LB62WK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  has completely changed my morning routine and saves me a LOT of time getting ready."
17,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is great for dry, tangled hair.","This is my first purchase of this leave in conditioner. This product really does moisturize my very dry medium thickness hair without making it greasy. It also is a great detangler. It leaves my hair soft and gives it a nice sheen. It also helps tame frizz. I am trying to grow my hair very long. I really believe that this conditioner is going to really help with preventing breakage. A little goes a long way. I concentrate the product from the middle of my hair length downwards, and put a smaller amount above that. The smell could be better, but it is not as bad as some people are saying. It eventually fades to what I would maybe call a musky vanilla."
18,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS,"THIS IS THE HOLY GRAIL, LADIES!!!!! I have incredibly dry, frizzy kinky  hair.  This product gives me uber moisture and GLOSSSSSSSS. A little goes a lonngggg way!!!!"
19,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Try This...,I have thick naturally wavy hair.  Although after having 3 kids I have lost the thickness somewhat out of my hair because I have lost a lot due to birthing and breastfeeding. This product has helped with the overall restoration of how my hair “used to be before having children.”  The value is awesome because you get a lot for your money as a little bit will go a long way.  The scent smells amazing also. It is a light vanilla like smell but not like whoa overwhelming.
20,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Breaks hair off,"Made my hair and grandson hair fall out, look just like we cut our hair in patches. This use to be a great product. I have a good mind to SUE!"
21,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I finally found something that leaves my hands and hair soft - without silicones! My hair is naturally grey but i color it, leaving it frizzy, dry, and out of control. All the condioners I was using, left my hair just as dry, and made the skin on my hands very dry. This leaves my hair and hands so soft. I let my hair air dry. My grand daughter was stroking my hair and said ""Mimere, your hair is so soft. It used to be so rough"". I recommend it to my sister and my friends"
22,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too Heavy for my hair,"I was excited to try this based on the reviews. Unfortunately, it's way too heavy for my thin damaged hair. Left it feeling so weighed down and super greasy. Tried again with an even smaller amount, the same result. I usually use a leave-in spray conditioner. Going to go back to that instead. All fine hair is not the same."
23,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oul,"Shea is a leave-in moisturizer that has saved my over processed, brittle hair.  In addition to damage from chemicals, my hair is naturally wavy & frizzy.  My hair is now stronger, healthier, & shinier as a result of using Shea.  I have been using this product for at least two years.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has dry, damaged,  brittle, frizzy hair or just wants healthy, shiny, manageable hair."
24,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this product differently,"As a leave-in, this product is too heavy for my 2c fine curls, but it works GREAT as a deep conditioner. I use it after shampoo and conditioner, leave it in for a few minutes, wash it out, and my hair is moisturized for days! If you feel it's too heavy for your hair, try it this way and see what you think. I also hate the smell so washing it out is good for that too :)"
25,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,Cant say much just received
26,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Formula has changed,"I used to love this leave-in conditioner. I have 3b-3c hair and would only use this by itself since it had a liquid consistency that when dried left a cast. It was almost like a gel leave-in. Unfortunately, now the formula has changed so it’s much thicker and lighter in color and it has more of a cream consistency. I have to use it in combination with a gel but it’s still a good, and it is great for detangling."
27,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product,"Awesome, one of the best leave in conditioner. Curls are soft and shiny perfect for daily use."
28,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The BEST moisturizer! 🙌,"Highly recommend, this is a GREAT moisturizer, especially for dry or dull hair.  Leaves hair super soft, shiny, smoothes out frizz and smells very fresh and soft with a faint smell of coconut but not strong at all.  Oh and it's not greasy...so, if you apply with wet hair, then leave to dry, it won't dry greasy."
29,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,I dont understand,"This was a great product, an amazing well thought out product gifted by the amazing natural ingredients perfect for the hair for once, Then it disappear out of nowhere when I finally found it it got pricier by almost 3.00 and the ingredients are not the same. The smell tell me all, together with the consistency.  Why would the company do that???!!!"
30,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,DON’T DO IT!!!!!,You guys if you have thick hair I would not suggest this at all it initially I got it & off bat it smelled like play dough I got multiple comments about the smell being bad also it did nothing for my hair when applied it was wet so I thought it would moisturize and settle in after 10min my hair was dryer than before and a lot of breakage over the time using over idk what this is but it’s horrible
31,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great moisture for my hair,"Sheamoisture is always my favorite goto hair product. I trust the brand, I trust the product and my hair is happy.  The scent is amazing, I really like it. I keep my hair braided and I just apply a small amount over the plats during the week, until I'm ready to takedown.  Well known and safe hair care product."
32,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,SMELLS LIKE CIGARETTES IN A TUB,"I was so excited for this because of all the great reviews until I opened it. Never mind that the package leaked, the real issue is the smell. As soon as you open the jar, a pack of cigarettes smacks you in the face. I couldn’t believe it was supposed to be that bad so I went to a drugstore and yep, that’s what they all smell like. I’ve used it twice but can’t focus on the product’s effectiveness because the scent lingers on my hair."
33,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,She Moisture Rocks Natural & Color Treated Hair,"Being back in a chlorinated pool, my hair is impacted swim cap or not. I am not glueing a cap to my skin, my skin would come apart. So leave in conditioner is back. I like Shea Moisture products. I do dilute the shampoo & conditioner, very fine hair here. The leave in conditioner, I apply to the dry frizzy ends only. Very nice results."

35,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells Like Play Dough, but has Great Slip","I love the slip and ease it brings to detangling. Not a fan of the smell as it smells like play dough and not like any of its ingredients. It is taking me a while to get through and I have been using a generous amount, so that’s a good sign. Overall, I may buy it again if I don’t decide to try something else, but I’m liking it."
36,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply Efficient and luxurious,"It's been so difficult for me as a 4c girl with picky hair to find a good moisturizer and I must commend that I have found it. This moisturizer is the bomb, it is not too thick or heavy, the scent is not too overpowering and most importantly it is very moisturizing, keeps your strands moisturized for days. I will definitely be purchasing more of this."
37,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Irritating to Skin,"Worked well to moisturize my hair, but the skin on my neck that touched my hair was super dry, red, and irritated after using it just once. I saw a review that said one ingredient in this, Behentrimonium Chloride, is toxic above 0.1%. I'm thinking this is why I had such a bad reaction. It's been a week and my skin is still not recovered."
38,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems to work, don’t like the smell","So far this seems to be doing the trick for moisture. I’m trying to play with the amount I use because I have thin, wavy hair so my first few applications have left me hair greasy. It’s the scent for me. My goodness it smells exactly like play dough and I’m struggling with that."

230,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  I have been using this leave-in conditioner for at least 4 years now and it is hands down my absolute favorite.  I have fine thin hair that has a slight natural wave to it and I had a hard time finding a leave-in conditioner that provided good moisture without leaving my hair greasy or weighing it down.  This stuff exactly what I needed.  I divide my hair into two sections and use a small starting at the ends and work it up to about halfway.  I always let my hair air dry and this does a great job of providing moisture and also seems to add a bit of volume.  The smell is very nice, subtle and not overwhelming.  I would say a jar lasts me about half the year."
231,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil had me a little worried when I first opened it.  It smelled good right away but I noticed the seal had been ripped and that the white cover you peel off when you open it wasn’t glued on to the top.  I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt that the heat had caused this to occur but it did make me nervous to use it at first.  Just something for them to consider improving on.The product itself is interesting.  I was imagining more of a Shea coconut butter feel to it.  It has somewhat of that texture but a little more oil feel to it when it’s applied.  On my skin, it didn’t really absorb the way typical shea butter does.  It did moisturize my skin though but it left a little bit of that oily feel that didn’t quite dry.  I guess there’s a bit of a personal preference element to this product too.  I felt that it left my skin and particularly my hands too oily feeling.  I also used a very small amount so a little goes a long way with this product.  If this is a type of product you use often this jar will last a long time.  You can easily do your arms and legs with a small dab of it.The scent reminds me of vanilla and coconut.  It’s subtle once applied to your skin.  You certainly feel well moisturized after using it.  I just wish it soaked into my skin a little more than it did.  I think the price is decent for the amount of product you get.  Like I said though it’s a little suspect that the tamper-proof seal doesn’t seem to stay glued to the top when you first get it.  That is something I would highly recommend is reworked on this product just so the consumer can feel more confident in the product being safe."
232,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,This made my hair fee! Really dry after application.,"I washed my hair with my usual professional salon brand shampoo and then applied this leave in to my towel dried hair.  I allow my hair to air dry and I wonder if that could be why my hair felt like straw once it finally dried completely.  Normally a leave in conditioner will make my hair feel so soft once its fully dried, almost too soft.  But that wasn’t the case here.I pretty much avoided my roots entirely when I applied this but found that my hair just 2 days later was greasy from root to end.  Which is not the norm for me at all (I can usually get by washing my hair just once a week, twice is an indulgence).I have long, black hair that is kinda wavy, kinda straight which I color monthly (roots only bc of those pesky gray buggers!).My hair has a tendency to feel dry/frizzy when I use products that don’t suit my needs.I won’t give up on this leave-in because I have had good results with this brand in the past.  I think I just need to find the right concoction to make this work for me.  Maybe a different shampoo or actually heat styling my hair would make a diff.I have to say that when I first opened the jar I was like OMG this smells so good!  Then when I applied it to my hair, the smell brought back memories of play time and blue playdoh (not a good thing).  But the smell did not linger.  It had zero smell shortly after application which IS a good thing.  It would be a total deal breaker if my head smelled like playdoh all day long.I hope my humble opinion has helped you in some way.Thank you for reading."
233,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have long thick wavy box-dyed hair for reference. This leave-in conditioner is really nice, but takes some figuring out. I had a lot of trial and error before I landed on the right amount for my hair. I found that applying this conditioner to my damp hair was a little too risky. It’s easy to go overboard. I don’t know why the instructions say to apply a generous amount. When I did that, things always ended badly. Rather than scoop some out of the tub, I just tap my fingers in and use what sticks to my fingers. Focusing mostly on the ends and then brushing my hair to spread it around. If I try to spread it around with my fingers, it just ends with me using too much and having oily looking hair that looks like it needs to be washed. I really found that I had the most control with this conditioner when I applied it to my dry hair. So I apply a little bit while my hair is damp, and then go in with the rest after my hair has dried. It does a nice job of smoothing out frizz and tackling dryness. One more thing that I want to note is the scent. I was a little worried about the apple cider vinegar and peppermint, but I can’t smell them at all. I mostly just smell shea butter and it’s pretty mild. This isn’t a leave-in conditioner that will overpower the senses or compete with perfume. I’m really happy with this product now that I have figured it out for my hair type, but it did take a bit of learning before I got my desired result. And at the rate I am going through it, this tub will last me a very long time. Overall, it’s a very nice leave-in conditioner…just go light!"
234,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have naturally curly hair, and it can be unmanageable at times, which is very frustrating. I recently got it cut, and the hairstylist recommended that I invest in a good leave-in conditioner, which should make my curls more manageable and cut down on the frizz. I have been a follower of Shea Moisture for years and have tried other products from them, so I figured it was worth it to give their leave in conditioner a try - and I am so glad I did!This product has a firmer consistency than some of the 'smoothie' products I have tried - I appreciate this because it's easier to put on and doesn't make as much of a mess. The jar is generously-sized, as well. I use a generous portion, but since I have shoulder length hair, it's not a ton. I work it through my hair and then let it air dry.It definitely makes a difference. My curls are more manageable and less unruly. I am much happier about the looks and definition overall. I highly recommend giving Shea Moisture products a try. The ingredients are more natural, it is very easy on my sensitive skin, and they really do work. They are worth the money!"
235,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First of all, I love the smell of this conditioner. Normally, I’m not fond of scented products, especially if they have even a hint of artificial fragrance as those trigger headaches. This conditioner, though, has a wonderful, natural scent that I like so much, I find myself opening the container just to sniff it. Trust me, that never happens. The scent is sort of vanilla, but not overly so, with just a hint of peppermint. On to the conditioner itself. The first time I used it I took the instructions to apply a generous amount too literally and ended up with far too much in my hair. It left a heavy, greasy feel; however, my hair styled well and had an incredible amount of volume. The next time I used less, still enjoyed the benefits of conditioned hair and lots of volume but without the greasy feel. I’ve learned I don’t have to use very much, even on my thick hair, so the tub is going to last a long time. I love this stuff!"
236,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This has a very strong scent that my husband and I decided was ‘waffle cones.’ It’s not bad, but it’s kind of strange to feel like I smell like that. I used a scented mousse but couldn’t smell it at all because this product dominated it.  It is a great moisturizer, though, and makes my hair feel really soft. I’ve used this company’s Curl & Style Milk and like that scent, so it’s too bad they didn’t use that. That other product is really difficult to get out of the bottle, though, so I do appreciate this tub. It is large (20 ounces) and should last awhile. It weighs my curls down a little, so I don’t think I’ll use it every time, but I can definitely feel that it’s softer, whether I braid or curl it. I can even tell when it gets wet that it’s more moisturized. I like it and recommend it, even over the better smelling style milk (I’ll just use a perfume or something)."
237,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This makes me sad, as I am a Shea moisture fan, lover, and user.The container is very large.  The conditioner is a bit soupy , I feel to be in such a large, wide mouth container.I had very high hopes of the leave in conditioning my hair, softening, protecting.Using on damp hair, it spread well, seemed to absorb at first, and needing more .Seemed to be softening, but later when I wnet to scrunch a bit after hair dried, it wasa weird greasy yet hard feeling. Not crunchy, more like hardened grease.Looking at my ends later, they kept tangling and locking, and I could see breakage.I use oils, balms, and leave ins - but never really experienced something that starts out good ,and turns into zapping my hair.Maybe too much castor oil ??Sorry S.M.  this did not do it for me  :("
238,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Smooth thick consistency and a very mild scent. You get a nice size tub of it, 11 oz. Conditioner has Jamaican black castor oil in it plus peppermint, apple cider vinegar and organic Shea butter. You can smell the apple cider vinegar in it. Smells nice, very mild, not overpowering. Consistency of the conditioner is good, melts into the hair nicely. Ingredients look natural and the conditioner contains no sulfates, parabens, mineral oil, phthalates or glycol. Also no animal testing. Black castor oil has omega 3's in it, the peppermint invigorates the scalp and the Shea butter moisturizes nicely. I enjoyed using it- it feels good on, I like the result and it's all natural. You get a lot and a little goes a long way. Overall, a good conditioner."
239,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a large jar of leave in conditioner. It’s easy to scoop out and apply to the hair. The top unscrews so every last bit can be used without wasting any like in a squeeze bottle. I leave it beside the tub so when my little girl is done with her bath I put some on her ends that tangle easily. It’s softening and absorbs well in her hair. The scent is soft and smells like vanilla to me. It’s sweet and pleasant. Even after her hair has dried, you can still smell the leave in conditioner.  I also like to run her large tooth comb through her hair with the product in to really help cover all the strands. I have been pleased with the moisture this puts back into the hair. It makes it silky smooth and smell lovely."
240,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"When it comes to the SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Leave-In Conditioner, 11 Fluid Ounce I really don't care for the smell.  This is more moisturizing than the other JBCO leave-in by SheaMoisture, but just barely.  I would say its just not moisturizing enough even in an optimal setting with my hair.  I could have clean hair that is misted with warm warm and my hair doesn't feel moisturized enough with just this.  I still have to use it with other conditioners and lotions.  My hair felt dry after I took my twist out down.  The twist out itself was OK, not the best, but not the worst, but my hair was just so straw like.  I wanted to wash my hair again and start over with something else.  I have 4C Low Porosity hair.  I didn't check the ingredients to see if this is actually good for low porosity, but you live and learn."
241,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic cream for my fine, flyaway hair!","This Shea Moisture leave-in conditioner is my new must-have hair product! I have baby fine, shoulder length, straight hair. I color my gray (which is probably about 75%) so I have the added problem of flyaway, quirky gray hairs that stick out at weird angles. I have been searching for a product that tames my hair without weighing it down, and I have found it!First, on opening the generously-sized jar, I noticed the delicious fragrance! The natural ingredients combine to give this an almost cookie-like scent! It’s a really nice experience to smell this every day while I style my hair.The directions say to use a “generous amount.” I took this advice and used about 1/2 ping pong ball size the first time. Oops, much too much! This made it hard to dry my hair, and made my hair feel coated and look slightly greasy. It washes out easily and entirely. So, the next morning, I tried a fingernail-size dab. Perfect!I’ve been using this leave-in conditioner daily and have reaped several benefits. It does do what I have been searching for by taming the flyaway grays to the extent that it can. My bob style stays smooth and lasts longer. Fine side hairs don’t fly in my face nearly as often. My hair looks shiny and smooth and feels really healthy. I have a small area of ends that are heat damaged, and a tiny bit extra of this cream smooths this area and makes it unnoticeable.SheaMoisture has created an amazing cream that I will be buying on repeat!"
242,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I prefer this leave-in over the lotion. This is lightweight & leaves my hair every moisturized. I could go about 2 days without having to reapply any additional product in my hair, which is what I do on weekends. I don’t seem to need as much when compared to the lotion. I apply this after washing my hair & do not need to apply any other product in my hair except gel/mousse to my edge to prevent flyaway.MoistureIt moisture my hair very well & I don’t need to add any other oil or moisturizer. It also allows me to go longer (a week) before washing my hair. I use to wash my hair everyday to every other day. My hair feels moisturized without feeling greasy or oily.ScentThe scent is lighter than the lotion which can be unbearable. However, the scent is much lighter in the leave-in conditioner which I can tolerate & even enjoy as it’s light.BuildupI do not use this on my edge as I use gel as I find it doesn’t play nice with other products. If I put this on my edge & then apply gel, my hair gets white & flaky from product buildup.OverviewGreat moisturizer with a light scent. You do not need addition products in the hair."
243,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't been using this product for very long, but I am so impressed with the first couple of uses. First off, it smells so, so good - like a sweet smell that's somewhere between coconut oil, cocoa butter, and vanilla (it doesn't smell very strongly though, and the smell is totally gone once it dries). My hair honestly looks shinier and healthier than it did a few days ago when I started using this. I have pretty thin, caucasian hair, and using a dab on the lower half of my hair (mostly on the ends) is the perfect amount for me. I don't put any on my scalp since I don't want it to look oily. It really seems to have made a difference for me in the few days I've been using it, and I have tried a LOT of products with this same desired effect. I really like this product so far."
244,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Healing in progress,"I have to say this product has shown some great changes in my hair so n just a weeks time. I have biracial hair that it naturally curly. Well From time to time I flat iron it to get that lengthy ponytail. I try to be careful and use a setting of no more than 370 degrees. Well when I wet my hair, I noticed that I got my Shirley temple curls BUT about the last 3 inches of my ends were “Spidery”. I think I burned by accident. The rest of my hair had pretty curls but dead straight and stiff at the ends. I got this product and in a weeks time, my natural curls are coming back when I wet my hair. Only about the last inch is still in need but even that’s softer now. It truly does restore🙂"

It has good ingredients and never disappoints us.I and my daughter have type 4b hair. I put this in after washing and conditioning, then follow up with an oil to seal in the moisture.

It made my hair ROCK hard, tangled, and even after I stopped using it I still have severe breakage.My oldest daughter loved it and she used it. Took out all of her hair on one side of her head! Trash.Now we both have bald spots where there weren’t any before and doing deep conditioning to get our hair back to it’s normal state."
247,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This leave in conditioner is fairly ok. The jar is a decent size and the scent is nice. However, It is not the best I’ve used. It doesn’t have as much slip as I would like. On a scale from 1-100, where 100 is enough slip, I’ll give this a rating of about a 69. It just seems like something is missing or the proportions are off or something. I prefer to use it along with other products to help fill in that gap. Because of that, I don’t plan to make any future purchases."
248,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"We're really liking this leave-in. We're a family of black, white and mixed and it's been working great on each of our hair types. For first use I'd suggest starting with a small amount. It's thick but very moisturizing and a little can go a long way…especially on damp hair but you can of course apply it on dry hair. We've been putting it in our daughter's hair before bed and again in the morning and it helps make the styling process much easier.Scent-  smells good, like a mild mix between shea and cocoa butter. If you've ever smelled raw shea butter it usually has a strong smoky scent-  this is much more mild and pleasant."
249,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like playdoh, gross",I washed my hair and applied as directed. First thing I noticed was that it smelled like playdoh. After a 5 days it still smells like playdoh. I just bleached my hair and I was looking for a leave-in that moisturizes. Well my hair looks dull my ends are still dry looking (I know there’s no fixing that without a cut but some products can mask that) AND on top of everything I woke up one morning with the biggest knot I’ve ever had in my hair. My hair is wavy and does not usually knot. I’ve had my hair bleached for weeks now and I never had a knot like that until I used this product. I will continue to use since I did spend money on it and give it another try. But that playdoh smell might make me throw it out.
250,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using this for YEARS because I need a leave-in conditioner for my thick natural hair, so I was happy to see it available in a larger size. I use this after washing and before twisting or braiding and it makes my hair so soft and easy to comb through as I detangle. It smells great and has saved my hair from tons of breakage and is a staple in my natural hair care regimen. If you have 4C hair this is definitely the leave in conditioner for you."
251,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used this product in a more lotion consistency before.  This is pretty much the same only in a tub version.  To be honest, I feel like the bottle version is cleaner to apply  - rather than sticking my fingers into a tub.  But, it works very very well for my hair and I typically put it on my hair right after my shower so I shouldnt worry too much.  It helps cut down on frizz and keeps my hair soft.  It has a very mild unoffensive scent."
252,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I absolutely love the scent of this leave-in conditioner. I am a big fan of Shea Moisture products and this one is no exception. I am mixed (black and white) and have very thick curly hair. I use this to help keep my hair conditioned and soft. My local store is almost always out of Shea Moisture products every time I go so I appreciate that I can just order it online. It's not cheap, but it does last me a while. The amount you use just depends on your hair. I have to use generous portions because  my hair is thick and long. Others may be able to use less. Overall, would recommend."

I always use the same brand/scent conditioning mask and love it. So I was excited to try the leave in conditioner. I was surprised by the watery consistency. I put it on after towel drying my hair and left my hair to dry naturally. I was worried it would make my hair too straight and take out the curl, but it didn't at all. It smoothed the frizz and left really nice curls!! Love it-highly recommended!"
254,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!,"Buyer beware! This product is NOT what it used to be. Originally, the 11oz JBOC leave in conditioner was very similar to the OG formula that used to come in the 16oz tub. My most recent batch, however, was NOTHING like the batch from 2018. The product used to be runny, but now it's borderline watery.  As a 3c/4a curly girl,my roots are often frizzy. The product that USED to make them shiny and wavy with hold only makes my hair brittle and undefined. Shea Moisture has pulled a Shea Moisture and changed the formula AGAIN. The ingredients list looks the same, but that doesn't mean anything. The ingredients can appear in the same order, but there could more or less of something. Do NOT buy. It's not the same anymore."
255,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like how well this softens and keeps my hair moisturized. I have kinky hair and apply it while wet after washing and conditioning my hair. When my hair dries it feels softer. I also apply it when dry and it's great for smoothing my edges when they start to get dry. I like this a lot better than using gel. It has a very nice scent and isn't greasy or heavy on the hair while providing good moisture.

This conditioner smells amazing and makes my hair so soft without weighing it down. That's usually the problem I have with any type of conditioner, they can weigh my hair down. This one thankfully doesn't do that."
257,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a fairly thick cream leave-in conditioner that is slightly off white in color.  The scent is soft and pleasant.  There are no silicones/dimethicones/parabens/sulfates in this, so it's exactly the type of product I want for my very curly hair.  I use a very large dollop (covers the center of my palm) for my curly hair that is past my shoulders.  I add a little more to the ends after I work the first dollop through my hair with my fingers.  This leaves my hair very soft, but not sticky or greasy.  I highly recommend this for curly hair.  I like this better than the ""D. C."" brand name of leave-in I usually use.  This is more economical for me as well."
258,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This reminds me of Queen Helene Cholesterol Cream.  But it is thinner and supposed to be leave in while the Queen Helene Cholesterol Cream is rinsed off.  I think it does nourish your hair but because it has a thicker cream consistency that you leave in, it does weigh your hair down.  As a result you really would not want to put too much on your hair or use it everyday.  It is good every so often for a deeper treatment.  Another this is that your hair also looks a bit greasy with it on."
259,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a really large container of leave in conditioner.I was pleased and surprised by the size of the jar.This is a nice consistency for a leave in.It reminds me of a medium consistency conditioner.To me the smell is like marshmallows or vanilla.It has a sweet scent but it is not too sweet.I like the way it smooths my hair.
260,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,This has made my hair super soft! While my hair is not overly damaged it is very coarse and dry in sections and coloring has definitely taken a toll over the years. This is pretty amazing. It smells very natural with a hint of peppermint - I wash and condition my hair then apply this and put a shower cap on and leave it for a few hours (while I clean etc) and sometimes overnight.After rinsing it out my hair is so much more manageable and softer!
261,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My hair likes this stuff fine...it’s just the smell is a bit weird. It smells a little like playdough. It’s...certainly different, but far better than some of the heavily perfumed crap that is in other products.Helps keep my hair soft, shiny, and reasonably happy.Just make sure you don’t use too much."
262,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow wow wow! My hair is naturally curly, but it's also dry as a dessert and I've been trying to find a product or the combination of products to bring back the curl. I accidentally left a protein mask on too long and even my most moisturizing mask couldn't keep my hair from being crispy after I showered, but this stuff!!! I put it on as thick as I dared and hoped for the best. My hair came out feeling amazing and even had a little hint of a curl. It smells very nice, like cocoa butter with the hint of mint and herbal, the scent faded once it dried."
263,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,works well for me but has a terrible smell,"This stuff works well, I use it right out of the shower when my hair is still pretty wet. I put it all over and when my hair dries my curls keep their shape and my style stays in place. I will say that my day 2 curls are wearable but they don't look great. Also, it doesn't leave my hair feeling crunchy. The smell is TERRIBLE smells like an ashtray! The smell definitely doesn't stay once my hair is dry, it fades to a subtle smell, not at all like the ashtray smell straight out of the tub."
264,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have fine, frizzy, chemical treated and colored hair, so I'm always looking for a good deep or leave-in conditioner. First of all, this is hands-down the absolute best smelling hair product I've ever tried. It's not a chemical smell, it's a wonderful fresh natural smell. Using this as a leave-in is a bit too much for my hair type - my hair also gets greasy easily and this exacerbates that. However, it is excellent as an overnight conditioner! It makes my hair incredibly soft and manageable."
265,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like Shea Moisture products I’ve been using them for a long time.

267,SheaMoisture Leave In Conditioner Conditioner For Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil To Soften and Detangle Hair 20 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Some leave-in conditioners weigh my hair down but not this one.

It smells delicious and is just the right amount of creamy and wet. It is not greasy in the least.

It also helps to eliminate dry brittle texture and enhances my own curls without flaking.

I’ve received so many compliments on my curls since I started using it. I love it, it’s a nice light scent and your hair doesn’t dry stiff or crunchy.

0,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken container,"To be clear, I really love this product. But I was unable to even use the container that was just sent to me because the lid and seal were cracked and the product was exposed. Everything else in the box was fine and the box was in good shape which leads me to believe it was broken before shipping. Disappointing."
1,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,ｈｙｄｒａｔｅ,"I have thick hair with fine strands, and keep it pretty long and neon pink. The ends have probably been bleached 6 times combined by now and it gets pretty frizzy. Overall my hair is super cooperative, but I wanted to try to smooth it out and kill the end-frizz a little bit. This feels nice going on, it smells good, and my end of my ponytail is like an inch smaller (in diameter, in a good way).I included a picture which doesn't really do the smoothness any justice but it's WAY more tame now."
2,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did this expire?,"This is gross. I don’t know what the white specs are and if the oil is separating. I’ll never buy deep conditioning off Amazon again, and I really do love this product, I didn’t feel like going to the store so I ordered it off of here. Never again, I don’t know why they would package it when they can clearly see it looks gross."
3,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product for moisturizing my hair,"Arrived on time, in perfect condition. As advertised. Provides my hair with needed moisture & softness. I use it as a deep conditioning treatment, and sometimes as a leave-in conditioner. No complaints."

5,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work for me,"I have a lot of hair, but it's thin and my curls are are quite big. This product actually took my curls away and made it frizzy. Olive oil works a lot better for me.I have a friend who has tight curls and thin hair - this product works for her."
6,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,The need better packaging,Product works great but packaging was subpar. The jar looks already opened and leaking out.
7,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great smell!,"I love the smell, it smells like clay or play dough and I've only used it once so far and it didn't  make my hair as moisturized as I thought it would, but i have noticed my hair looking fuller and finally laying down.  Overall this is a good purchase!"
8,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Regrows hair,"Shea Moisture really regrows hair better that any other product. I use the Jamaican Black Castro oil shampoo, conditioner and masque. It's for all hair types. My stylist says she has never seen anyone regrow hair as fast as me and for me to keep using. I already had thin hair, but was losing hair due to a medical condition. She always comments about how thick my hair is getting. I would highly recommend this product for anyone losing hair."
9,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE WHAT THIS HAS DONE FOR MY HAIR,"I have been shopping around for a lot of deep conditioners/hair masques (they are the same thing if you were wondering), and for me, this has produced the best results for my hair. I have used deep conditioners that have damaged my hair, produced no change in my hair, and have produced positive results for my hair. This one reigns supreme in my particular case. I have medium porosity hair, which leans towards the dry side. I use this once a week, for half an hour. I recommend putting a plastic shopping bag or similar item over your hair while you let the product work it's magic. This will trap the heat in your head and hair which will open up your hair (similar to how heat opens up your pores on your skin) and allow the product to enter your hair better. My hair has become softer, visibly more moisturized, and it maintains it's curls much better (I am someone who is trying to make my hair curlier using natural products). Use this product consistently for several weeks (along with a leave in conditioner) and you will notice an improvement in your hair. I will say this, I find the scent of this product to be very pleasant, however, the smell is definitely reminiscent of play-doh. Do kids still play with play-doh? It is a milder scent, and if you use other hair products like leave in conditioner, you will most likely not be able to smell it after you wash it out. But I guess if your nose is extremely sensitive to any semblance of play-doh, then you may need to pass on this amazing product."
10,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Holy heck, YES!","I bought this for myself as I'm on that skin&hair track~ but my partner needed it more so I used it on them first. It's AMAZING. For some background--my partner has extremely THICK hair and bleaches semi-regularly. Their hair was starting to feel very dry with some elastic-y parts. I covered their head in this shiz and left it on for a few hours (not even a full night) and now their hair is SO soft and the elastic feeling is ENTIRELY gone, and the frizz is almost entirely gone.In addition to that, it smells amazing. It's thick and a little off-putting to handle with bare hands and if you have really thick hair I'd recommend wetting your hair first and pinning it up after."
11,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful product, terrible smell...","This masque works wonders. It would have been given 5 stars but the smell is very off putting. If you can forgive the playdough smell then it's wonderful! Sorry the color balance is off in the after pictures, I had 3 different lights on. I see a difference in volume and definition. My husband used the word ""silky"" when I asked for his opinion. I will continue to use this as needed to help my itchy scalp and damaged hair that comes with cold Michigan weather."
12,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Did they change the formula?,"This product seems like it’s changed since the last time I purchased it. It’s lighter, creamier and smells different. Or, and this is possible, I received a canister from an off batch. But definitely different in color, texture, and smell. It may work the same or better, but I was thrown off by the difference so I wanted to publish that here."
13,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,DO BETTER!,"This is such a nice hair mask. I really love it for my hair. However, what I do NOT LOVE is the it arrived broken with the conditioner spilling out of the container. The sellers need to DO BETTER!!!!!"
14,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Formula change is TERRIBLE!,"I fell in love with this mask 5 years ago! This new batch is NOT that great product!!!!! :( This new batch has a scent so strong it makes my throat scratchy and gave me a bad sinus headache.  I can already tell it is drying my hair out too. I live in the desert SW and my hair is very long. I have struggled to find a good product that does not cost too much, as my hair is down to my knees. Masks seem to do the best, conditioners do not keep my hair moist. This mask was changed last year, maybe the year before. The quality has just gone down, from great to too waxy to now drying with an awful, awful, terrible scent!"
15,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"To avoid wasting time and money and possibly damaging your hair, do research and find out your hair type first. If you have fine high porosity hair 3a-3b hair like me, this product may not work for you. I didn't know any of that when I brought it and it burned my scalp when I put it on and made my hair hard and brittle. Save yourself some headache, get to know your hair and don't reinvent the wheel if you already have products that work well for your hair. You may just need to follow a method like LOC, LCO, LAOC or LACO."
16,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for coarse hair,"I use this after every shampooing and it keeps my hair nice and soft. It smells of almonds. I have tried so many other brands, but this is the only one I don't want to live without for my coarse, wiry, graying hair. It is a thick cream. I leave it in for about 5 minutes  before rinsing and once a month I leave it in for 2 hours."
17,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,A MUST BUY FOR SURE:,"OMG, THIS HAIR MASK IS WONDERFUL!It left my hair feeling soft and manageable, I will be ordering more it’s a MUST BUY FOR SURE.I’m low porosity, low density, type 4a ALL NATURAL"
18,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake product!!,Please read the most recent reviews and don’t waste your money this product is fake! I didn’t believe the reviews and purchased anyways since I’ve had trouble finding this in stores. The original scent is very mild and sweet while this smells very strong of play-doh. This product is the only thing that gets my dry bleached hair very soft but whatever is in this knock off has made my hair even more dry and prone to breakage. Please don’t waste your money I’m so disappointed I love the convenience of Amazon but rip offs like this make it worth the drive to the store.
19,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hair mask!!,"I had bought this hair mask at Walmart a few years ago and I recently ran out but couldn’t find it in any stores. Was so excited to find it on Amazon. The jar was shipped quickly and arrived without any spills. Love this hair mask. I use it at least once a week in place of my normal conditioner. I have very thin fine hair that can get a bit dry after coloring it every 3-4 weeks. I find this mask helps bring moisture back and makes my hair silky and shiny again. It smells amazing like almond and coconut!!!! The directions say you should apply it to wet hair, put on a shower cap, and apply heat. I have used it that way before when my hair felt very damaged or extremely dry however most of the time I use it to replace my daily conditioner and leave it on for at least 10 minutes while I am in the shower."
20,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,"I've tried many hair masks over the years and non have made me want to buy them again except this one. I've used black caster oil by itself for hair and lash growth, but because of the texture of my hair, the oil itself just made it super greasy, even after washing. I went looking for a mask that had it in it, since I thought the ingredient would help hydrate my hair, but since it wasn't the only thing, it would not make my hair greasy. I was right. I have a lot of hair, but it is wavy and fine. The mask helped the frizziness, while adding softness and shine without making it greasy. It makes my hair feel nice and healthy. I will definitely buy this product again when I run out.Also, the product has a nice smell, vs the smoky smell of just plain black caster oil."
21,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing,I love this product. I did notice the way the lid fits so tightly that when I opened it the first time I could hear the lid lifting up the seal on the inside. So I don't think it was opened before since I heard it tear. It smells AMAZING. I have damaged hair from bleaching and coloring pink/purple. I put it on after shampooing in the shower and wore a shower cap. Rinsed out after about 15 minutes and went to bed with wet hair. I awoke to soft wavy hair like it's supposed to be instead of a big poofy mess. And my hair smells great.
22,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST MASK FROM THIS BRAND,"I have tried the protein mask and the Manuka honey masks from this brand, but this black castor oil mask is the best one so far. My hair is chemically damaged and also has a lot of frizz and this is the only product that has helped me with that for now. It doesn't really smell so good, smells like play doh to me but its not too strong so it shouldn't be a problem. Due to the consistency you don't need much product, a little goes a long way. My hair ended up looking silky, smooth and with less frizz than usual."
23,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mold? Mask just looks HORRIBLE!,"Someone please correct me if I’m wrong. I have no idea what the white stuff is. I’m hoping is not mold, maybe the cold weather got it like that? I’m pretty sure it’s not supposed to be that way. I’ve used this mask many times before and it was never this way. Saw it at target only a single one left and looked just like this and I avoided buying it for the same reasons and decided to order here. Either this mask was not mixed well from factory or is full of mold. Will definitely return and ask for a refund!!!!! Sad to say goodbye to this mask because even target has it like this! HOW!?"
24,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"Having never used a hair masque, I was hesitant, as my hair is often oily, and I was afraid it would exacerbate the problem. However, after reading all these glowing reviews, I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. The directions are fool-proof, and it left my hair smoother, and shinier than it ever has been! I also think it prolongs how long I can go between washes. I would recommend this product to anyone - especially those with wavy/curly hair."
25,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Rejuvenated my blonde hair,"I like this product because it does work and makes my hair soft and rejuvenated, I have platinum blonde hair and it needs moisturizer often, I use this product about 2-4 times a month.It definitely has helped my hair overall, I put the product in my hair at night time and sleep with it for hours, and then I wash it in the morning. Hair is sleek and super soft.One thing I dislike about this product is that it smells like playdough. That’s the only thing I dislike is the smell isn’t too pleasant"
26,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged blonde hair.,"I just received this product after being left with fried platinum blonde hair. My hair is breaking and it’s extremely frizzy. I left this masque on for about an hour, while I was doing other things at home. The product by itself is very thick and it takes time to rinse it off. Hair doesn’t stay greasy at all. After first use I can say that my hair is less frizzy and it feels less dry. I will continue using it, and I hope I’ll get even better results."
27,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST DEEP HYDRATING CONDITIONER FOR CURLY HAIR!,"I just recently purchased this product to try something new on my dry thinning hair. I must admit, this truly is the very best deep moisturizing-hydrating deep hair conditioner I have used. I have used so many various brands throughout the years. If you have natural curly hair, you already know how challenging it is to finding products that rejuvenates and keeps your hair looking vibrant while feeling soft and healthy. I will honestly say, “This is one of my favorite products I will continue using! I am going to try their shampoo & conditioner for color-treated, dry curly hair. Will keep you updated! 😃"
28,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go-to treatment,"I am a 27 yr old latin/white female. i have wavy, thin hair (but a lot of volume). This mask works miracles for my dry, color damaged hair. I use this mask once a week and let me tell you... worth it!! my hair comes out feelings SO moisturized yet not too greasy. I rinse it extra well on my scalp because i have naturally oily roots. No foul smell, a little goes a long way. My hair from root to especially tips are moisturized and healthy look/feeling. I recommend this to even men who have longer hair, completely detangles everything! And this does not bother my eczema i have at the base of my scalp on the back of my neck. Highly recommend!!"
29,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Winter Minnesota, product is poorly packaged, looks like someone opened it already","It is middle of winter in Minnesota. Today's temp when I picked up my package was around 30 degrees fahrenheit. Upon opening the package, you can see on the product has leaked to the side just a bit, see picture 1 and 2 for reference. Therefore, the product should not look like it is melting out of the plastic tub that it is in.When you open the product, there's a noticeable dent inside the packaging, which makes it look like someone had opened it. If you turn the product around, you will notice that someone slipped the paper top back on using the product as a 'glue' to make the paper top stick back on, hence the product having the conditioner inside the top.I don't imagine buying at a local Target or Walmart will get this kind of poor and used-looking product. Will not order from this person again."
30,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very heavy, very moisturizing","I have ordered this product a couple of times.  My hair is very thick and course, and my curls are 3a/3b.  I need a ton of moisture and use it as a leave-in.  I definitely recommend this product.  Most folks will probably want to wash it out because it's super heavy."
31,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ingredient change, or a fake product","I’ve used this product for years and it is a godsend. This time upon ordering I noticed a significant difference in texture, and little white chunks that were previously not in the many jars I’ve purchased in the past. I took a look at the ingredients and noticed a few differences, a couple ingredients that the company proudly advertised as not using in their products were now added in the new jar. The first two photos is the new jar, and the last two are of a jar I purchased a few months ago. My hair is noticeably less soft after using the new product. Extremely disappointed."
32,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much needed if you’re transitioning,"I am Transitioning from relaxers to natural, this is a game changer and a much needed product to build strength and restore my curls. I have 2 textures of hair until I decide to big chop.. I really like this product... no scent which is great..I have already purchased a second jar so that I don’t run out! Definitely a winner for me .."
33,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for my beard!,"This product makes the man bush on my face extremely soft and manageable.  Prior to using this product, my beard was pretty rough. I have tried many different conditioning products for my beard; but none compares to this product. The first couple of times, I left this in my beard for 30-45 minutes. The results were immediately noticeable. Now as part of my regular maintenance, I use this every time I shower.If you (or the man in your life) struggle with a rough beard; try this incredible product. This stuff is fantastic; highly recommended and wifey approved."
34,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad experience,This stuff is awefull. I washed the mask off and  I could not get a comb through my hair. My hair  felt stripped of moisture and very rough to the touch. I had multiple knots in my hair. I spent all day tring to detangle and conditioned with another product for 2 hours. Still a mess.. end result I lost a fist full of hair due to the knotting. I finally got it detangled by washing my hair all over with shampoo and reconditioning. My hair is detangled but its still dry and rough. Do not waist your time. try some thing else.
35,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't get my hair as soft as I like,This is good stuff. Just not making my hair as soft as I would like.I had used the packet before purchasing the jar. Effectiveness is not the same
36,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Literally THE best hair masque I've ever used.,"I'd like to preface this by saying that no matter how nicely I treat my hair, it is always sad and crispy and breaking off.Anyways, I use this once weekly on my dry, brittle hair. No other conditioner/masque I use has ever touched how effective this one is at taming my baby hairs and keeping the ends smooth. I have medium wavy texture with lots of frizz, and even though this can be a little bit heavy, it adds a good deal of shine and softness. It helps a lot to disguise the split ends!"
37,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,You need this.,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Okay so this masque works after you shampoo your hair. You put it on from root to your ends and leave it on for about 10 minutes then wash it off and put on your conditioner. I love this masque !! It has worked wonders with my hair, smells and feels amazing on my hair, and really moisturizes my hair."
38,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Came in the mail open,"It’s horrible the cap is broken, and it looks like it was used"
39,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Buy at your own risk,The first time I opened the product it smells exactly like play-dough ?? I haven’t tested the product out yet I love Shea moisture so i trust it will work
40,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived damaged,I was so excited to use this product but it arrived horrible
41,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hair miracle,"First time using a hair mask & I LOVE it, my hair was soft & shiny, let's not forget moisturize, I had been suffering from breakage, and I've gotten at least 4/5 inches cut off after using this,  but I'm happy because I will be using this to regain a healthy  journey, guys this is a must buy"
42,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair in product,"Just received this today. Opened it up underneath the semi protective seal, and there was a hair in it."
43,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love your hair and get this, no regrets","I've never used divine to describe anything before but this would be it. Love the scent and it works wonderfully. I'm on the path to blonde so bleaching and toners means my hair needs love and this is it. I used this after a bleach and noticed a major difference from the usual times that I've bleached in the past; much softer, no breakage, it really does what you need it to do. Absolutely buy this and spoil yourself."
44,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works really well!,"I've been using this product for around a month or so and really like it! I have thin, straight hair that isn't color treated, and I've found it works great as a weekly mask to improve shine and moisture. I put it on about 2 tablespoons all over my hair after shampooing, put my hair up, and let it sit while I'm in the shower for 10-15 minutes once a week.  The smell lingers a bit after using it, and it smells vaguely of play-doh, but it's so faint I don't think it's noticeable to anyone around me."
45,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Never Fails,This product is consistent and will have a great impact if you are natural or if your hair has extensive damage. It has saved my hair and allowed it to flourish during the transition phase up to my big chop. I still use this as a staple and will continue (unless the formula changes haha). Definitely recommend.
46,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"I’ve only used this product once and all I can say is wow. My hair is brittle and damaged from repeated processing, bleach and poor quality hair products.I paired this mask with my first time use of the redken extreme shampoo. I didn’t use conditioner and just followed my shampoo with the mask for 30 minutes, from scalp to roots.I blow dried my hair following the rinse and instantly saw a reduction in the frizzy fly always as well as less hair breakage/fallout throughout the day.I was even more impressed that after using this on my scalp I was able to go 5 days without a wash. My hair didn’t grease or oil up on me as it usually does.10/10 just buy this."
47,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,I use this on my ends and middle part of my hair and just plain cold pressed castor oil for my roots. I use a lot of heat on my hair and using both products has definitely improved my hairs overall health. I am losing significantly less hair and its growing again. I've been using castor oil on my roots once a week by itself for about a year and just started using this about a month ago! Cant go without either now!
48,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Consistent use brings results,"As a hairstylist I always recommend this to clients who need to strengthen their hair to use weekly.  When followed and consistent, I always see results.  No product, no company is a miracle worker overnight - you have to commit and do the work - if you do, your scalp and hair will most certainly benefit.  I’m a big fan of this company and this specific product."
49,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells nice,"I use this in addition to my normal conditioner.Works ok as a stand alone treatment though. The longer you keep it on, the better.Makes your ends look soft and smooth if they’re damaged."
50,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken container,"I have used this product for years and I really like it. However, I ordered it from Amazon for the first time and it arrived broken. The container was cracked and the product was leaking out. I could return it, but for the $7 I would get back it’s not worth packing it up and going to the store with it. I’ll just scrape what I can out of it and put it in a new container. I’ll spend the extra money to buy it somewhere else."
51,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect if your hair is dry!,"Very thick and creamy. Smells great! I have fine, curly hair and can usually get ringlets but I’ve grown my hair out due to Covid. My hair has been tangly and dry for months. I used this last night by applying to damp hair and leaving on for about 20 mins. My hair feels soft and not tangled! My curls are looking good again!"
52,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Uh,"The product looks disgusting (pretty sure it isn't supposed to be like four different colors, including booger yellow) and the seal was partly opened.

53,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Expired???,I've been using this product for a long time and I've never seen it look like this.

54,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST PRODUCT EVER,"This product was WAY more than what I expected. It doesn’t really have a smell to it, but doesn’t smell bad. My hair is dead from coloring, bleaching and curling my hair. But after a week of using this, it has helped my hair grow which is crazy, it has helped my split ends and after every wash makes my hair SO SOFT. I shampoo my hair first, and then apply this product all over my head and scrub it really good on my scalp and ends. I leave it in for about 5-7 minutes and then wash it out. It does not leave my hair oily at all. This is the best thing I have used and will be using forever."
55,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"Been waiting to write a review for a while. Been using this for about a month now. I use it every time I wash my hair. My hair is bleached and frizzy and dead, but my hair LOVES this. Mostly my curls. When I don’t use this my hair is so dry it pokes my skin. When I don’t use this my curls also dry out, frizz out, and hardly curl. I love the smell and I love the thick texture because it’s so moisturizing for my 2b curls"

308,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,TOP 100 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This is my wife’s favorite hair treatment product. She’s been using it for about a year and it has made her hair healthier and minimized split ends.She uses it twice a week on just the ends. It really smooths and tames frizzies. However, since the mask is pretty rich in oil, it can make hair limp and oily if used in excess. My wife’s recommendation isto play with it and see what works for you.Applying it on the entire hair length didn’t work for her because she doesn’t like a very smooth look but applying it only on the ends has made her hair healthier and voluminous.The scent is very subtle and pleasant, so it’s a great product for those who are sensitive to strong scents too."
309,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,TOP 50 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have naturally curly hair that I straighten, bleach, dye unnatural colors such as blue/purple/etc.. and my hair is generally very damaged. I normally can't even wear my curls naturally because they turn to pure frizz. This product allowed me to wear my hair natural and it was sooo soft! The best part is the price, I can actually afford this one, many products that actually do work on my hair are too expensive for me but this one WILL be re-ordered.4 Star Rating:This item arrived in good or great condition with no flaws or damage.

310,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My wife has been using this Caster Oil based hair masque on our daughter’s hair for the past couple years. Since my daughter’s hair is 4c texture, it can be a bit hard to manage at times.  To help manage and style it, my wife applies this product to our daughter’s hair then puts it up in a shower cap and applies heat for about a half hour. When it comes out, her hair is soft with a healthy sheen and is more easily styled and detangled. It doesn’t leave behind any greasy or oily residue either.One definite bonus for this product is that it smells pleasant. Caster oil is not known for smelling nice, and this bucks that trend completely. Since my daughter is young yet, something that smelled foul would likely not go over well.My daughter’s hair is about shoulder length, though it would be longer if stretched out. A 12 ounce jar of Shea Moisture Caster Oil lasts about 5 treatments before we have to get a new one.Bottom line:This is a great product for restoring moisture to hair. It helps soften hair and if you’re someone with course texture hair or hair that is kinky or frizzy, this will definitely help."
311,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,HALL OF FAME,TOP 50 REVIEWER,"Shea Moisture is one of my go-to brands. They make very effective products. This one is a must if you have dry or damaged hair. It's thick and rich. Your hair will feel so much better after using this mask. If you want to amp up the results, try using it as an overnight treatment applied to dry (not wet) hair. I highly recommend this mask.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
312,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle worker!,"I recently put my hair through a lot of stress: I'd been dying it very dark brown for years and decided it was time to lighten it up. That unfortunately meant lots of bleach, then dye on top of it. After that process, my hair was left horribly damaged. I was seeing a lot of breakage, and it felt straw-like due to the dryness. I was excited to get to try this product out.For the price, the jar seems a bit on the small side, but it'll give you a solid several treatments based on your hair length (mine's about shoulder-length, and I used about a palm-full of the stuff). The scent is kind of earthy but slightly sweet; I found it pleasant. I left it on my hair for about five minutes, and my hair felt like silk when I washed it out. I noticed far less breakage when I combed through my hair and when I dried it, compared to my normal conditioner. My hair looked noticeably shinier and healthy. I did not experience any fading of my color (and red is notoriously a fast-fading color). It didn't get my hair totally back to normal, but I don't think any product really could with all the damage.Overall, I definitely recommend this product for dry, damaged, color-treated hair."
313,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I'm surprised at just how impressed I've been by both of the things I've tried from this brand. I also have their coconut and hibiscus curl and style milk, and it's wonderful for applying to my wet hair before styling to keep down all of the frizzy bits throughout the day. It makes me look so much more professional, and the fragrance on that is amazing.This deep conditioner didn't seem to be doing much upon application. It felt like it was just sinking right into my hair and not actually making things slick to where I could comb the conditioner through my hair very well, my hair felt a little rough and unconditioned. However, upon letting it soak in and rinsing it out per the instructions, after my hair dried I was surprised and impressed to see just how smooth, soft, and extremely easy it was to brush.I'm a white girl with medium thickness, wavy hair down to my backside, and definitely with hair that long, I really appreciate a strong hit of moisture.The one thing that was not my favorite is that the fragrance is just a little bit strong for me. It smells a little bit like a cologne, and while it's not overtly masculine, there's something in the fragrance that goes a little bit that direction. However, once it dries, the fragrance is not that apparent. It reminds me a little bit of the Moroccanoil fragrance.Overall, I'm surprised at just how impressively this kept my hair smooth, conditioned, and free of tangles all day long."
314,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: June,2020: after 3 months of use, I have to say it’s worth every penny! Especially in the summer heat and dryness, it is a god sent miracle....The hair is so silky and shiny after an application. Castor Oil has this property - making hair shiny and lustrous, enriches the natural color of your hair. IN addition, it also cools the body. SheaMoisture preparation captured all those benefits of Castor oil in a nice package.Only issue with this? It seems to remove any curls you may have. Other than that, this is a great product and is highly recommended..."
315,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This masque is amazing. My fine hair has been through processing hell and it looks it. Dry, damaged and dull, it seemed beyond hope. But this masque saved me from a buzz cut. It is a fragrant creme. It can be used as a conditioner or as a deep conditioning treatment. As a conditioner apply to clean damp hair, leave on for five minutes and rinse thoroughly. As a deep conditioner it is left on for thirty minutes before rinsing. The results are impressive. Hair looks and feels soft and silky without being If you are prone to frizz, this masque will help tame it. weighed down."
316,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice strengthening hair treatment. It comes in a nice little jar. When you open it you notice that it has a pleasant scent. You do need a good amount of this to cover your hair with it, more so than some others I have used in the past. It is actually fairly solid and not a soft more liquid kind of hair mask. It is free of sulfates, parabens, phthalates, propylene, glycol, mineral oil and petroleum and was not tested on animals, all huge pluses in my eyes.You let this work into your hair for like 5 minutes. It rinses out with ease which is great. Your hair does feel nice and soft once it is dry and looks very good. The scent lingers over night but is gone in the morning. This is a very nice product that works."
317,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used this hair treatment by Shea Moisture this morning, then I rinsed, dried, and styled my hair. Right away, my husband commented on how nice my hair smelled and looked. I like that this masque is made from Fair Trade shea butter, and that it contains no sulfates, no parabens, no phthalates, no propylene glycol, no mineral oil, and no petroleum. The company doesn’t use animal testing; another good thing in my book.My suggestion is to use the masque once a week, or once every other week, depending on the condition of your hair. I plan to use it twice a month. It’s very thick and you don’t need a lot, maybe a tablespoon full (I have long hair), so I expect this container to last a good, long time. I hope this review is helpful."
318,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love SheaMositure’s coconut oil. So I figured to try more from their brand. I like this masque because, the texture is almost like whipped cream. So the consistency isn’t greasy, oil at all. I scooped out a handful amount then I applied on my hair after washing my hair throughly. This masque is moisturizing, does not leave greasy and oily feeling on your hair. I think I could use this masque as hair styling cream because how light weight feeling they are on my hair.I would recommend if you want something light weight and need moisture for your hair. If your hair is extremely damaged I would recommend SheaMositure’s coconut oil. I would give 4 stars because I feel like I can use the whole jar so quickly."
319,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This deep conditioning hair mask does a great job of deep conditioning hair without leaving behind any greasy residue. I've tried several different deep conditioning treatments and this is the first one that didn't leave my hair limp and greasy feeling no matter how well I rinsed it. This stuff has the consistency of the original Noxema cold cream, it's thick but not heavy, has like a whipped feel to it.  I left it on for about 10 minutes and then rinsed it thoroughly. After treatment, my hair was super easy to comb through while wet.  When it dried, it was soft, smooth and frizz free. Surprisingly, it actually had some body and bounce to it too. This treatment has very little smell to it at all."
320,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I’ve been using this product for ages, and I love it! I have extremely dry hair that gets knotted very easily. Although this is supposed to be used as a hair treatment, I use it as my regular conditioner every time I wash! If I don’t use it, I can’t brush through my hair. I apply after shampooing and leave it in for about 5 minutes & rinse. It makes my hair smooth, less frizzy and doesn’t weigh it down at all. It’s extremely moisturizing! Highly recommended!"
321,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have been a fan of Shea Moisture products for several months now, and this masque fits right in with the other high-quality, effective products in the line. I love that their products are more natural and made without sulfates, parabens, and other harmful chemicals that especially irritate my sensitive skin.This masque is great at making my hair softer, shinier, and healthier overall. I have naturally curly hair, which can get quite dry and brittle. Now, I know just how to combat that! A little of this masque goes a long way, and since I will be using it about once a week, this bottle will last me a long time. It smells great and has high-quality, recognizable ingredients, such as peppermint and shea butter. I would highly recommend it overall!"
322,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG! Amazing!,"I have 4c hair, very thick hair coarse. I pre-poo by using coconut oil and conditioner to detangle my hair. I wait about a day or two to let it sit. Then I'll wash my hair.I usually wind up having to detangle again because it's still tangled. This time I didn't have to detangle it was so soft and easy to style into my protective hairstyle. I will be continuing to use this product. And it smells great. I sat under the dryer for a good 2 hours with a plastic cap and I added heat to the process. Great results!"
323,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Adds some much needed moisture to 4c hair. Leave it on overnight in a bonnet for even better results. Smells great and makes hair soft. Adds back some natural sheen as well so you dont have that full dry look. We do through this stuff like crazy and buy the regular conditioner as well. I use it lightly as a leave in for the little curly toddler as well and it keeps her hair in great shape - feels soft, adds definition, and gives her the moisture she needs. Love it!"
324,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The product that arrived was not this one but another Shea moisture product, it was also smashed and cracked upon arrival. I did eventually go out and get one for myself and I hated it. The smell is really strong and almost smells like old playdough. It is very thick and coats my 4a hair nicely but there wasn't much difference in how my hair felt after a couple of weeks, it didn't feel any stronger yet it didn't feel weaker either. Aside from smell, which did linger for a while after washing it out, the product was just ok for me and my needs."
325,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my favorite product by far for my dry, damaged hair.  I color my hair every 8 weeks or so, and we love in Colorado where we don't get much humidity.  This had tremendously helped moisturize my hair without damaging the color.  I love the smell.  It has a great shea butter smell.  It doesn't leave your hair feeling greasy or filled with product.  Very light moisture and shine.  I will be buying this product for a long time.  A little goes a long way, even though it's a bit pricey.  A jar lasts me around 3-4 months, with shoulder length hair.  Helps get tangles as well."
326,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stinks,Meh. It kinda just feels like I left any plain ol conditioner in my hair for 20m. Nothing fancy happened. No extra shine or better smoothness. I have very straight fine hair that i never style so I don’t have dry or problematic hair. Just weak and thin.It’s smells like playboh. Super. Gross. I really hate the smell of Shea this is a pass for me
327,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastico,"This worked perfectly. Great subtle scent. It seemed like it maybe needed a smidge of mixing, but when moisturizing lots of hair, that’s totally fine. Ten out of ten would recommend"
328,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I do love this brand. It does what it's supposed to, and quite well. This strengthening mask is no different. It's very effective and leaves my hair feeling soft and strong and smelling great. The Jamaican Black Caster Oil is known to encourage shine and rapid hair growth, too - noticeable hair growth. It's fantastic and I highly recommend it if you want longer stronger shinier hair."
329,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is supposed to be a conditioner but it makes my hair feel heavy and stiff. Everyone has a different type hair and my hair just doesn't approve of this conditioner.  To bad too, it has a great scent and it has a decent amount of product in the container."
330,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells amazing! Great for damaged ends.,"I use heat on my hair so my fine long hair ends crispy on the ends. This really helps smooth down the cuticles before I can go in and get a fresh cut. Smells amazing, and super nourishing. Doesn't leave heavy residue behind. If you have thicker, dry hair, this would be amazing to use all over the head as a deep conditioner. Overall, it's a great product!"

I found it hard to evenly distribute it on my hair as I just clumped together in one spot. I rinsed and my hair felt just like it did before I even applied this. Very disappointing. I had to use a regular conditioner after this just to detangle. This has a pretty strong fragrance that I found off putting.

335,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If it is time to nourish the hair, This will do it","I like that this has social-conscious ingredients. It looks and feels a bit like thick mayonnaise and the instructions say if you want it to be thinner, you can add extra virgin olive oil to it. It has a mild light scent that is pleasant, but I cannot describe it because it is so slight."

348,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved my hair!,Wrecked my hair with overcoloring/bleaching. It felt and looked so horrible I was considering cutting it all off. Bought this to try. Gooped it on and put on a processing cap. Sat outside in the sun for heat. Left on for 45 minutes. Rinsed it out and oh my gosh!! Huge difference!! Hair feels so much better. Soft and free of the tangles I've been dealing with for so long. This is a game changer!!
349,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t live without it,"Fellow curly girls (and guys), this masque is fantastic! I’ve tried nearly everything out there and I keep coming back to this. Once a week, I work this through clean wet hair, slip a plastic bonnet on my head for 20 minutes and let the masque do its magic. My hair is color treated (shhhh!!!), middle aged (also shhhhhh!!!!), and I sometimes use the flat iron on it. And yet when I use this masque, the result is healthy, springy hair, with great shape and definition.It has great slip, so it’s easy to work it through. And the smell is pleasant, though not overly strong. Plus, I love that it is in a tub, so it is easy to get all of it out."
350,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy!!,"Fake product!!! I compared this product to a one I bought from Ulta and Not only was the top already opened but the color, smell and texture was off!! Even the packaging looks different. Do not buy"
351,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Confused,So I’m a bit concerned because I can’t tell if the spots in the middle of this are mold (because it’s not like this product comes super well-sealed as we all know) or if it’s part of the product? Very concerned about putting this on my hair
352,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,For bleached curls,"I LOOOVE this, I have curly lighten hair and the only thing that really brings back my curls is the apogee treatment but I decided to try this one.

354,SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Treatment Masque For Dry Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Mask 12 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice product,It feels good on my hair and I feel like it has helped a lot. I don’t use a lot of hair masks so I don’t know if this is all of them but it’s slightly inconvenient to have to shampoo then put the hair mask on. It does yield nice results though.

0,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful for my hair,So I just started using SheaMoisture. I have thin dry damaged hair. I am using the shampoo and conditioner also. The first leave in I tried was the intense leave in which was just to much for my hair. So I tired this one instead and my hair is silky smooth and so so SHINY!! Also the smell is amazing!
1,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,NEVER AGAIN! WORST HAIR PRODUCT I'VE EVER PURCHASED!,"I am so dissatisfied with this product I could literally scream! In all my decades of life, I've used numerous products on my hair, and NEVER has a so-called ""moisturizer"" dried out and stiffened my hair. My strands were stuck to my head and so hard that I was afraid to brush them for fear of them breaking.To be fair, I applied this product twice so that I wasn't mistaking the results. There was nothing else in my hair, so the second time my strands stuck to my scalp, I knew it was the fault of this product. I'd even used this company's shampoo and conditioner, so this can't be blamed on any other product brand.During an economic crisis where slow shipping becomes the norm, this is THE WORSE time for failing products. I was happy this company hadn't overpriced its products too much like the majority of vultures tarnishing Amazon's great name. But, fair pricing is only a benefit IF the product works."
2,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have!,"Seriously love this stuff! For when I want to straighten my hair or for when I want to scrunch my locks. Adds moisture, shine, and hold the style. Only con is the smell I'm not a big fan of coco butter"
3,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t agree with my hair,I used it twice and it makes my hair hard. Returning...not worth purchasing in my opinion. But of course everyone’s hair is different.
4,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold and conditions,"Holds my hair together like gel, moisturizes like leave in conditioner and doesn’t take as long to harden as gel does. Looks more natural than gel or hair spray"
5,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok,"This product is ok.. I tried using it for the C in my l.o.c system and it was alright, but I rather use a butter. I think this product depends on purpose and preference."

7,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,so good for dry hair,"i use this everyday in the ends of my hair and it’s super moisturizing but not greasy. i personally don’t love the scent however, i put it on before bed and by the time i wake up the scent is gone so it’s no problem. my hair is currently the healthiest it’s ever been. idk if it’s because of this product alone but i do recommend it, the ingredients are amazing!"
8,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Makes hair very stiff and crunchy.,Makes my heart very crunchy and not bouncy. Would not purchase again. It’s also very drying and makes my hair stiff. I’ve attached a picture of my hair type for reference. I do not have this product in my hair in the picture. For the price this is not worth it. It’s a very skinny bottle.
9,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Would not recommend,Did opposite it dried my hair left a heavy coating. Very drying to hair .

14,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy This!,I LOVE this hair lotion! I bought it because of Lily Van Brooklyn's hair tutorials and it's phenomenal. I have curly hair and I just run some through my hair when damp and it helps with frizz and is super moisturizing. If I'm doing a curl refresh (non wash day) I just get my hair damp to restructure the curl pattern and add just a tiny bit more of this. It smells slightly vinegar-y when you first put it on but it dissipates in seconds then just smells soft and slightly sweet.
15,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Smell,"I bought this from awesome reviews on TikTok but I guess it’s just not for my hair. It smells great in the bottle but when I apply it to my hair, the scent changes to a burnt odor. It hasn’t done much for my dry ends so I don’t think I’d buy it again."
16,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Leave in Conditioner 4Home Blow Out,Best to use in damp hair after a shower..wrap it up in a towel so it moisturizes then blow it out with the hair dryer...this is my 2nd bottle and I will continue to use it on my wavey hair

54,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm obsessed with the whole SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil line!,"I've been using this, the rinse out conditioner, and the leave in conditioner on my daughter's hair for several months now and love it. First of all, it smells freaking delicious, like vanilla and cinnamon sugar cookies or something. It also works so well on her hair type (3 a/b, fine, curly, low porosity). I use this when I'm refreshing her hair in between washes. She goes to school so I have to do her hair for school everyday and this works really well when I'm styling her hair. It helps her hair to stay soft, shiny, hydrated, and reduces frizz throughout the day. Love it and highly recommend this product and the entire line!"
55,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,love this stuff,I have been using this for a very long time and I always have a bottle at home for my hair and my kids hair it is amazing it smells so good its so moisturizing and for our hair I stays moisturized for several day so we reapply to the roots every three days or so. it works well I have found over time that my hair looks and feel healthier and its soft. not every product works for everyone but this one works well for me plus the castor oil in it is great castor oil is so good for your hair and I love using it so the fact that its in here is an added bonus ...try this and you wont regret it.
56,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,I got this for my husband who has 3b hair - he loves it and has been using it daily. For me the scent is very “natural” smelling with a hint of mint and is quite different from some of the other yummy smelling Shea Moisture products.  That being said for a man it is nice and the scent dissipates after a short time. This has really softened his curls and defines them without any frizz. Overall this is a great product for curly hair!
57,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Styling Lotion moisturizes and revives damaged and dull hair!This styling lotion contains shea butter, peppermint and apple cider vinegar to moisturize and style natural, chemically processed or heat styled hair. It smells amazing and is great for your hair!This product is sulfate free and color safe. Apply a small amount to damp or dry hair and do not rinse out. You can use this styling lotion as a heat protectant before using heat styling tools.I highly recommend this product!"
58,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Styling Lotion, 8 Ounce is OK.  I really don't care for the smell.  My 4C low porosity hair is happy enough on days when I just don't have the patience or time with twisting or braid outs.  I would say its just not moisturizing enough even in an optimal setting with my hair.  I could have clean hair that is misted with warm warm and my hair doesn't feel moisturized enough with just this.  So, it's been a good I don't have time for this lotion, but I use it rarely because of that."
59,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Two Thumbs Up,"This product exceeded my expectations. My wife tried it first. She has long, curly hair and uses a variety of hair products, including gel, before she dries it with a hair dryer. She's used it several times and really likes how well it keeps her curls together. She also likes the scent.My hair is longish and wavy. I rarely use gel. Normally I just use shampoo and conditioner and then let my hair dry naturally.  However, after her great experience, I decided to try it. I am very happy with it and will probably use it daily now. I only used about a dime-size of lotion, and that was the perfect amount. My hair often gets a blown away look that I don't like, but this product eliminated that.This product is easy to use and works on curly and wavy hair. It's a Fair Trade product and has no sulfates, parabens, phthalates, propylene glycol, mineral oil, and is cruelty free."
60,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,HALL OF FAME,TOP 50 REVIEWER,"This is yet another great product from Shea Moisture. It hydrates my curls and gives them soft definition. I don't love the scent, but I can get past that. I suggest using it with the leave-in in this line for best results.Thanks so much for reading this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
61,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Soft, Shiny and NOT Greasy","This product really surprised me. I’ve never used a cream in my hair before and I figured it would leave my hair greasy and it didn’t make my hair look or feel greasy at all. The smell is amazing and you can still smell it after you Style your hair. Also, my hair is really soft and shiny. Also, you really don’t have to use a lot, so I think it’s going to last a while."
62,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I've been using all different shea moisture products for the last 6 years. I have a jarred version of this but have not tried this bottle of ""hair lotion."" I cannot get passed this smell. It has a sour playdough odor and does not smell good, and I certainly dont want my hair to smell sour. Not sure if I got a bad bottle or if it just doesnt mix well with my hair/ natural scent or it's the vinegar/other ingredients. The product besides the smell is good. Its thick, creamy, goes through wet hair nice, and moisturizes hair without making hair greasy. But i probably wouldn't get this again, and I think I will stick to their other products.."
63,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"A little bit goes a long way, I use it before dealing with the blower, the small is of natural products smell, if you are use to them it wont bother you but if your not and commonly use chemicals brand products then the smell will be unexpected.  Overall I think I need more time using it to see if it's one of those product I can relay on and integrate to my beauty routine."
64,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, this product has really been a lifesaver! My hair is curly, dry, frizzy and breaking. Sounds terrible and it was! I say ‘was’ because I saw improvements the first time I used this stuff. Smell isn’t so great, kind of odd but I’m willing to see past that because of the results I get. Smooths out my dry, frizzy hair and gives me some control as well. Hope to see less breakage with its strengthening ingredients. Really packs a punch. I only use this and the strong hold gel in this line because my hair needs lots of moisture and control! Thank you for great product. Improve smell and you get 10 stars!👍👍👍😍😙😙😘😗✔ Yes, I recommend this product."
65,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Results!!,"This SheaMoisture Styling Lotion works amazingly well!! It is super easy to use and a little goes a long way. Simply part your DAMP hair into 2-4 sections, depending on its density and apply about a dime sized amount of product to each section. Make sure your hair is damp though!!! Then simply let it air dry and the result will be soft, defined, healthy looking natural curls. The scent is also very pleasant, similar to a light version of cocoa butter, definitely nothing overpowering.Great Product overall & I would highly recommend!"
66,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I've always like shea butter to moisturize hair.  It's made from nuts and not petroleum products.  I also like castor oil.  I'm reminded of my two lovely aunts who always had a bottle of castor oil on their vanity to ""dab, darling"" on their hair.  Unfortunately I find the aroma of this product somewhat off putting.  Not overpoweringly so but enough that I was self conscious when going out and about after using it."
67,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Especially liking it for blow-drying it seems to help make it a bit more smooth. I've even used it to apply to dry hair before flat-iron by working it onto dry hair a little at a time…especially when first using it to make sure not to overdo it and applying extra onto the ends. Then I give it a few minutes to absorb into the hair. I can smell the Shea in the scent, though, it overall is not strong. Shea is a natural heat protectant on it's own and along with the other ingredients is pretty moisturizing. It's a great product!"
68,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love all SheaMoisture products so I knew I would be happy with this one!  I have fine thin slightly wavy hair and find my ends dry out pretty quickly.  I try not to blow dry my hair but I do use my straightener to tame frizzy pieces and this seems to provide good protection.  It also seems to add a volume and smooths out of my ends which is always something I could use more of.  I love the smell and a little of this product goes a long way! Another great product from SheaMoisture.
69,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not great,"I guess this depends on hair type, does nothing for my hair- hair gets harder and dryer than if there was no product in it. Quite the disappointment. However, I do realise it’s a pre-heat styling product so I will try it before a blowout to see if there’s any difference"
70,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,I used this product after I shampooed and conditioned my hair and before I used the hair dryer. The product has a nice smell and thick consistency so you really only need to apply a small amount of the product. I used the hair dryer and when I was finished my hair was nice and moisturized and not dried out which i love.  I wear my hair naturally for those that are curious. I would recommend this product to use before using heating styles.
71,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I love most shea moisture products but I use this one throughout the week if I'm doing an updo or just need to tame frizz and fly aways. I get a spray bottle and dampen my hair just a little not so it's wet wet. Then I take a quarter size amount and rub it in my hands and distribute it through my hair and I'm good to go. No flakes, not super shiny, and my curly hair looks great."
72,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love SheaMoisture products, including this one. The scent is not my favorite but I do like how this leaves my hair nice and shiny. I have 3b/3c hair and it helps to style my curls nicely. I find if I put too much in my hair, it does leave it a bit stiff so I don't put as much in it anymore. Overall decent styling product."
73,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I have to admit, I love Shea Moisture products so I am partial to this styling lotion!!

84,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like cake batter, deceptive label as far as ingredients","I was truly surprised when I read the actual ingredient list for this styling lotion and consider the label and advertising to be deceptive.  The ingredients highlighted on the label, including castor oil, peppermint, shea butter, and apple cider vinegar, are all far down on the list.  The bottle even contains more fragrance than any of these token but much-heralded ingredients.  An ingredient list is not provided on Amazon at this time and the lists that I found elsewhere are apparently from a different formulation and the ingredients listed currently are slightly changed but much re-ordered.The rich lotion has an unusual cake batter fragrance that is not unpleasant but which is not a scent expected or particularly welcomed in a hair product.  On the other hand, it truly is a good moisturizer, especially for damaged hair, makes styling easier, and provides good hold once the hair is dry.  Just be careful not to use too much as it does affect the hair's texture and feel.The bottle is small at 8 fl. oz. or 237 ml, so it's not the best value around.Ingredients as listed on the bottle that I received:Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Beta Glucan, Inulin, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Inulin, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Behentrimonium Chloride, Stearyl Dihydroxypropyldimonium Oligosaccharides, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Vinegar, Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Phytate, Panthenol, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Stearyl Alcohol, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Mauritia Flexuosa Fruit Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Niacin, Yeast Extract, Citric Acid."
85,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I put this product in my hair right after I washed it and I loved the result as it gave shine to my hair without feeling greasy. Unfortunately, the love I was feeling ended when my hair dried. Upon drying, it made my hair very crunchy which I didn’t like. However, I was able to remove most of the crunchiness by teasing my hair. My hair retained its shine after teasing it was which I love.I had to use quite a bit of product immediately after washing my hair, but required much less product on the days that follow. I only needed to apply the product on the ends & back of my hair which dries out more than normal since I don’t cover my hair at nights. However, the second of using this product, I noticed product buildup on my scalp which was a disappointment.It is best to wet the hair before applying as the product goes on white. I tried it in my son’s 4A hair and it was moisturizing to his hair though his hair was not shiny as mine. With his hair, I definitely noticed that the product didn’t dissolve in the hair if the hair was slightly damp. I had to basically wet the hair throughly to get the product to dissolve.After several days with the product in my hair, I could feel the moisture/grease in my hair to touch though my fingers didn’t look greasy. The scent isn’t overpowering at first but it become bothersome at nights laying in bed the longer you have it in the hair. By the third night of it being hair, I was truly bothered by its scent. I had to get up and wash my hair so I could go to bed & scents usually don’t bother me that much. Disclaimer: i mainly smelled the scent when I was laying down and the more product you placed in your hair, the stronger it became because night three scent was much stronger than the initial night of putting in the product or the night before. So if you’re very sensitive to smells, you definitely want to pass on this product. Overall, I can live with the crunchiness upon drying  because majority of the crunchiness can be removed after playing with the hair while still leaving my hair well moisturized & shiny! However, the scent would make me not purchase this item again as I found it too overpowering."
86,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,I am a long time user of Shea Moisture products.  They are a brand I love and trust.  I used this Strengthen & Restore Styling Lotion for my son's hair.  It really moisturizes and defines his curls.  The scent though is very off putting.  He and I thought it smelled like play-doh.  We shrugged and he went on to school.  All his friends at school immediately had compliments for his hair.  Then they got closer and all of them clowned him for having playdoh scented hair (he's a 9th grader).  Great product but the fragrance is very odd!  I might add my own essential oils to this to offset the smell...as this is my only gripe with this product.
87,Sheamoisture Styling Lotion for Damaged Natural Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Silicone Free Hair Treatment 8 oz,VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is great stuff, and it smells wonderful, too. I'm very sensitive to scents, but I like the smell of this.I don't actually use any heat products on my hair, so I was worried about this leaving behind a greasy feeling, but it didn't.I applied it and just brushed my hair like usual. Brushing helped to spread it throughout my hair, and it dried quickly. This lotion also made my hair softer and smoother."

0,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job smoothing your hair but..,"So the product does a great job smoothing out your hair and getting rid of fuzziness your hair tie may cause. During quarantine, I have constantly had my hair in a bun or ponytail and I noticed it was making my hair fuzzy. This product really helped with that making my hair look healthy. The only issue I have is the smell is artificial. It smells like fake fruit. The smell bothers me a bit and took me a bit to get used to it. On the other hand, my sister loved the smell and uses it like perfume for her hair. It sprays kind of weird so I would recommend spraying your hand and then applying it to your hair."

I recently bought this to use it as a curl refresher when te curls need a bit more moisture after a couple days of the last wash. It is very oily, which my hair likes a lot. It also offers the protection my hair craves. Today I decided to give myself a blowout and it turned out very good for being a self made job. I didn’t put anything else on my hair but this spray, and it offered me enough protection and moisture. I am a fan!!!"

9,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,I have been using this product for a while now. Its good to know that it protects and helps my hair to grow
10,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was expecting,"This product was marketed as a heat protectant, even though the packaging says Anti-Breakage Spray (not heat protectant).  It makes the hair moist, like spraying it with water.  You really do need heat after that if your plan is to curl or flat iron.  Other heat protectant sprays have more of a dry oil base, and don't make the hair moist and frizzy beforehand.  I would definitely use it like a leave-in, but it doesn't work as a standalone heat protectant."
11,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful terrible product. Contains alcohol,Horrible product. The number two ingredient is alcohol. It drys hair out!!!  Very damaging to hair. It’s trash.
12,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,eh.,I bought this spray for heat protection and as a leave in for my very frizzy prone curly hair. Its Eh. Its not the best but for the price and availability its worth those days that you could care less about your hair but need to put some effort into it. When I used it to straighten my hair it didn't work any special magic. My hair was still frizzy. When I used it as a leave in it didn't work any magic then either. I would use this for protective styles and that's about it. It does smell great though...I added pictures of me with straight hair (mouse in the middle) to show the results.
13,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Changed formula,I used to love this product until they renamed it and changed the formula. It used to have ACV but it is no longer listed on the bottle. The new formula made my hair look dull and very dry. I returned it but they told me to keep bottle but I’d get my money refunded. Not even they wanted it back. Lol. Not sure why they had to change the formula. I guess I need to go research an alternative heat protectant.
14,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy Hair!,"I blow dry and straighten my hair every day and I was looking for something with castor oil for its wonderful benefits.  I decided to give this a try and I was not disappointed.  This stuff is amazing!  It leaves my hair so soft, healthy looking and way less hair on my brush after I straighten it.  I also don't need any hair products after I style my hair because it leaves it so beautiful.  I can't praise this product enough!"
15,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Makes hair wet.,"So this sizzled my hair when I tried to use it as a heat protector. It made my hair wet which it shouldn’t. Heat protection should go on dry, not wet. Best to use for natural hair that you’re not applying heat to at all. The smell is a mix between playdoh/clay and Castro oil for sure."

After finger combing through my hair I apply gel and then dry with a blow drier. I get very soft, moisturized bouncy curls.My fiance uses our spray bottle with water and JBCO to get his hair damp and then he runs the foam through his hair. he says it leaves his hair soft with little to no frizz.

136,"SheaMoisture Anti-Breakage Spray, Jamaican Black Castor Oil Heat Protectant with Shea Butter, 8 Fl Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Better,"I don't know why but my previous review is gone... so that's odd. I will have to check back to see if this one stays up. I wrote a bad review before so I am not sure if they had it removed or what but basically I received my first order opened without a cap and missing product/leaking/with dirty fingerprints, as if it had been used. I really liked that this has a high rating as far as safe ingredients for a heat protector for your hair, so I decided to send it back and get a new one sent back to me as a replacement despite this first impression not being so good.I am re-writing this review after receiving a replacement. Hopefully this one stays up. But basically the new one they sent back I like a lot more. Performance-wise, it seems to do the trick well as a heat protectant. It even works well as a leave-in conditioner if you are not heat styling your hair to give it more softness and to moisturize any frazzled ends. I applied to my hair where it is dry and it softened it immediately after running my fingers into it.My favorite part is definitely that they use all safe ingredients. It is also cruelty-free along with a few other environmentally conscious aspects.The only con is that this is NOT lightly scented whatsoever so if you are sensitive to fragrances, you may not be a fan. I'm not ordinarily a fan of highly fragranced things myself and I was thinking it would be a light shea butter with a bit of peppermint smell, since it says it has peppermint in it for some reason (on the back it states it has pepperming to make your ""scalp tingle"" - I don't know why they would need to do that as this is not a shampoo).But no, it doesn't even smell at all like peppermint. It instead has a strong sweet smell like sugary frosting on a cake. It indeed does smell very similar to cake frosting, if I had to give it a name. Kind of a strange scent for what the ingredients are. So, if you can't get past smelling distinctly like a birthday cake all day it may not be your thing. It wears off a little bit over the day but it really is quite strong at first and lingers on your hands even after washing them off. The strong and unusual smell for a heat protectant spray is why I knock off one star. Everything else seems great so far."

I have tried several products that did absolutely nothing for me. But I am telling yall, I have only been using this product for a few weeks, and I can already see a difference. I have used this product about 5 times now, just a few pumps rubbed all over my scalp and left overnight- and my hair seems fuller, even regained a bit of my curl. I hope I will continue to get great results. Yes, it smells weird, but I could care less because after you wash, the smell is gone, and it really works."

This oil in particular is the only one that works for me. It does not irritate my scalp; my hair follicles actually absorb the oil, rather than just sitting atop; it softens my hair whether my hair is wet or dry. The castor oil is very concentrated, so a little bit goes a long way. The scent may be too much for some, but I thankfully have never received a pungent batch. Shea Moisture also offers other types of oils as well. Recommended!"

It leaked during shipment, but I wasn’t going to return it for that reason. The true reason I’m returning it is 1.) the pump DOES NOT work. It could be because mine was damaged in transit, but I’m wondering if I got an old/bad bottle because 2.) it REEKS like burnt peanuts. I will be unable to use this product, so I will be returning.

It's thick , dark, and VERY moisturizing. This is the best skin moisturizer oil around in my opinion. I've used extra virgin coconut oil and rose hips.

I have seen any difference in my hair with products made with it or not.  However, I decided to give SheaMoisture 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil, 1.6 Fluid Ounce a shot.  I have used a lot of SheaMoisture products.  Some with success while others just pure disaster.  I've used their oils before namely the Argan and Flax Seed.With this oil, I decided to put some in my spray bottle of water and the SheaMoisture Low Porosity Leave in Conditioner.  That is my go to for detangling and prep for twist outs.  Annnnnddddd, nothing.  Either JBCO is a sham or my hair just doesn't give a damn.  Because no difference for better or worse.  I will say my hair did not feel like straw like when I use SheaMoisture products that have the JBCO in it.  So, I either need to find a way to use JBCO to my hair's benefit (I'm running out of ideas) or it's just my hair hates it.  I would say overall the smell isn't too bad.  It's milder than flax seed, which was plus.  At close to $14, I know I can find this in a big box store (with a bullseye logo) for almost half that price."

That castor oil does not compare with this one. Because this one is actually real. I was surprised at the thickness of the consistency of the oil. Note that the oil is not actually black, but rather light brown. The other so-called Jamaican Castor oil i tried was not even brown. But anyway, i would totally get this oil if you are looking for the real thing.I apply this oil at nights on my eye brow; it  has a convenient dispensing on top so there will not be a mess. And this actually works for me - i apply it at night on my eyebrows, go to sleep, and wash it off in the morning with soap. My eyebrows look healthy, and empty and hairless spots are starting to grow, seriously. I am shocked."

I actually love the scent. It is light, earthy, and natural.It is very thick, so you will want to just use a squirt or two and mix it with lotion or cream. I mix it with my Skin Trip coconut lotion and I LOVE the combination.It does not irritate my dry, sensitive skin at all. In fact it is super-moisturizing.The only thing I don’t like is the bottle squirter. Since this is a really thick oil it doesn’t pump out very easily. I end up taking the top off and just pouring a couple drops into the palm of my hand, then mix with my Skin Trip lotion.This is a very affordable, super moisturizing oil. I love that it doesn’t have any synthetic perfume. It is so good for your face and really helps with smoothness and anti-wrinkles!! Love it!"
15,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This Castor seed oil is not black but more of a brown slightly thick consistency compared to others.  The smell is very subtle.I discovered there are many uses for this oil.  You can use on eyelashes, you can mix with your natural hair care product and apply to your scalp or you can use it like how I do mostly and mix with with my Shea butter.  It works great to moisturize your skin. You can use to alleviate rash, itching dry skin, even use a little on eczema.  My friend's grandmother says it's good for muscle and pain aches as well.I even put a little in my diffuser.  But because of the slight thickness of it I didn't use a lot.If you're using on skin or hair I recommend using twice a day. Something as natural as this can only help and be healthy for you."
16,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice oil. I have eczema and use pretty heavy moisturizers, but I have lighter ones that I like but that don't quite do the job of moisturizing adequately. I added about 1 tbsp of this to my lotion, shook it really well, and am getting much better moisture from it now. There is a scent but it's very subtle; it's like you would expect castor oil to smell. You can use it on your hair, according to the bottle, but it's too thick for my fine texture and I worry it could discolor my light hair (something my stylist warned me about). It makes for great cuticle oil, and is an all-around good product for when you need a shot of moisture. A little goes a long way, so I anticipate this will last quite awhile. Best of all, it doesn't irritate my extremely sensitive, picky skin.Recommend."
17,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I got this for my husband because it supposedly promotes hair growth, moisturizes dry hair, and strengthens it.  I haven't noticed any difference in his hair or scalp and neither has he.  It is perhaps slightly moisturizing his scalp but I'm not sure it's worth the cost for what it seems to do.  Especially since it smells terrible.  It smells a little like a dirty, dusty street where the dust meets asphalt on a hot day to combine for a truly unpleasant aroma.  I appreciate that it's 100% pure so should be working at it's best but I think it needs an added perfume or something to help combat the scent."

I apply this oil at night.  It enhanced growth of the eyebrows and eyelashes.  It is much better than Latisse or any other pharmaceutical products.

A little pipette helps distribute just the right amount of oil.Castor oil is also great to use on face and it is especially good for hair."

This Shea Moisture 100% JBCO is definitely that.  It has that thickness and earthy smell you come to expect form real JBCO.  It comes in a pump top bottle, but oil is too thick to pump.  It just kind of spurts out every other pump which is very frustrating.  Eventually I just dumped the oil into a pointy nose application bottle.  Much better and easier to apply as well.  I use it for moisturizing my hair so I mix with coconut oil to cut the thickness.  Works great; no dry scalp here and very moisturized strands.  So definitely recommend, just use a different bottle."

23,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for thick hair,"This product is great for thick hair. I will say that my mother has thinner hair so back castor oil breaks her hair, but on my hair, it does nothing but moisturize my hair. It is great during the winter months when my hair is more dry than usual. The way I lie to use this product is to wash and condition my hair—the normal routine— and then rub this product between the palms of my hands and apply a thin layer to my hair while wet."
24,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Put some of this on my lashes and they grew pretty well. I haven't tried this out on my hair because it's thick (somewhat a pain to remove the residue). It does moisturizes my skin really well.  This oil is a tad bit on the expensive side but you can tell that its the good stuff because of how thick it is. Overall, it's great and it definitely helped me out with my lashes."
25,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Weird smell,"I ordered this in hopes of regrowing my practically bald eyebrows so I wouldn’t have to draw them on. The oil is a thick brown and the attached pump works well. However I just can’t get over the scent. I have a very sensitive sense of smell and the weird smoky, nutty scent might be mild but it lingers. This product isn’t for me. It reminds me too much of dirt and cigarettes."
26,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love SheaMoisture Products,"This Jamaican Black Castor Oil does not disappoint.  I'm not a fan of the smell but I normally add it to my other oils that I make for my hair to help keep my hair moisturized. It's a pump action bottle but don't hold that against it, it's really good for your hair if you are natural shoot it's still good for your hair if you have a perm.  It's worth buying this product."
27,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Scent is too peppery for me.....,"This is good if I mix a little bit in with my regular hand lotion (I have dry skin in the winter). Very thick consistency. A little goes a long way.I personally I didn’t like the smell. It had a peppery scent that I couldn’t stand unless it was masked by something else.Overall, good for moisture, not good for my nose."
28,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,"Very moisturizing. I use regular castor oil on my body after I get out of the shower to moisturize. I’ve heard that black castor oil is even better for your skin and hair growing benefits, but it has not so nice scent that does go away mostly after applied. Would just use this type for small areas instead of all over. Seems to be good quality."
29,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a long way,"So far I've used this in my body wash,  lotion,  and shampoo.

30,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,Castor Oil is generally a thicker oil. So I apply this during the night time so I can wash it out in the morning. I plan to use it for my eyelashes and hair. It will take a while to notice the difference but these natural oils doesn't have any negative effects compared to more man made solutions
31,"SheaMoisture Head To Toe Oil and Hair Oil for Dry Hair and Skin Jamaican Black Castor Oil Paraben Free Hair Oil, Body Oil 1.8 oz",VINE VOICE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this to mix in with my body lotion and am not a fan.

I saw no improvement in my skin and it smelled horrible.  The consistency is very thick rather than a more runny oil such as argan oil.  Even added to a dollop of lotion, this didn't help with my dry hands or legs."

0,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,12 year dream came true,"So listen everyone, I don’t right reviews as often as I should since I rely on them so much, BUT I had to write a review for this product. It took me 12 years to find it. My 12 year old daughter has thick, coarse and curly hair that dries very easily. My hair is thick but soft and get weighed down by oil easily. This product works on both. I have done my own hair for years (since freshman year in college and I am now 38 years old), and I have a strict regimen. This product works really well with Mizani smooth guard conditioner. After shampooing with the black castor oil shampoo by Okay (rinse out), I use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Okay conditioner and comb through with a big tooth comb. While it’s still in, I comb through the Mizani thermasmooth conditioner and Comb through with a skinny tooth comb (mixing conditioner doesn’t always go well but this makes the hair smooth like butter). I rinse out really well and towel dry. I add a small amount of Shea Moisture Strengthen and Restore Hair serum (This product) and comb through with big tooth comb. Then Use the Jinri 1876W Salon Dryer and blow dry straight with big tooth attachment. I part hair in fours and flat iron each section with Rusk CTC Technology flat iron. I curl with the flat iron, wrap and tie up. In the morning, her hair looks like she came straight from a celebrity salon. I am not tooting my horn as her stylist (I only do my hair and hers),  but I am excited I finally found the right mix for her hair after 12 years of experimenting. I am a BIG believer that there is no such thing as “good hair,” but all hair can be good when you adjust to the personality of a particular hair type. We all have the hair God wanted is to have. As you can tell I am over the moon and figured I could set someone else free!! I hope you are abundantly blessed by this review!!!"

I don’t even care about what it’s supposed to do for me I just love the way it smells! For the record, it does do great things for my hair. So shiny and soft, smooth and SMELLS SO GOOD. I can’t say it enough. Buy it."
2,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use it on my flaky scalp. Smells amazing!,Used it on my scalp in hopes it would help sooth itchiness and flaking from psoriasis and maybe promote some growth. The scent is so subtle and wonderful. I love the feeling of this oil. I think I've noticed significant reduction in itchiness and it's definitely made my hair feel nourished.
3,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The holy grail!,"I'm a young male that's been suffering from a receding hairline for almost 3 years now. I've always been told once that happens there is no hope of saving it because it's a genetic trait. But I want to tell any guys out there that's going through the same thing, this stuff will bring your hair back to life! After two in a half weeks of using this product, my hair is healthier looking and nearly back to the way it was before I started receding."

5,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helped my hair grow back.,"I had a lot of hair loss a few years back when I got really sick. I was getting so embarrassed by how thin the front of my hair had gotten and regular castor oil was too thick for my hair. (Straight, slightly wavy, blond.) This stuff has been a miracle for me. My hairline has filled in and thickened up so much that my husband stops me and tells me how much thicker it's looking. This is great stuff and, when combined with a good diet and some vitamins, it makes a huge difference that I wasn't seeing from vitamins and diet alone."
6,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Product Line,"La la la loooove this product line. I just started using this oil and it's amazing. I also use the shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioning mask AND the heat protectant spray. My hair has grown so much in a matter of about 3-4weeks. It's grown so much using this product line that my daughter asked if I had extensions in my hair. My hair is so soft and vibrant. I would recommend this to any and everyone!"

This is the only castor oil product that is balanced between smelling good, not too thick yet it rejuvenate my hair and scalp. This is so good that you can sleep in and not to worry about grease on your pillow case. It smells so good that it actually promotes a restful sleep while repairing your hair."
9,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Okay For Some,I'm not sure if I just have a really dry scalp but this did not moisture my scalp at all. My curls seemed to like it through.
10,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Safety Seal Missing,Sooo I should have just kept moving after I saw multiple reviews regarding the safety seal. I wasn’t completely surprised that the safety seal is missing. It is a little concerning that this seems to be a trend and Amazon hasn’t pulled the product. Like what y’all doing that you need to remove the safety seal?!?
11,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken seal and weird stuff in bottle,Seal was broken amd bottle contained dark brown spots and streaks throughout the bottle. I dont feel comfortable using it but it isnt eligible foe return nor replacement. What a waste of my time and money
12,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hair loss/Breakage,"For starters, I am a woman of color. I have thick, curly, natural hair. Not too long ago, I allowed my beautician to color my hair. Unfortunately, it had over-processed, lots of Breakage & thinning. I then decided to manage my hair myself.  I have been using Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo & Conditioner Masque. It has truly restored my hair!!! So... I thought to try this oil. It truly RUINED my hair. I've always had thick curly edges. They are now thinning.  I am so upset!!!!! Starting my process completely over."
13,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love love this!,"I am loving this hair serum so much! It is light, absorbs easily into the scalp and doesn't leave my hair feeling oily and heavy. I have been using this serum regularly for almost a month now and am noticing a significant increase in shine and smoothness in my hair. My hair also seems to be growing a bit faster... not by a lot but noticing definite improvements!The only downside of this product is the relatively strong scent that generally puts me off... but I figure that's a small price to pay when the product is so good at what it is supposed to do."
14,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!,"I absolutely love this stuff. I use the entire line with the shampoo, conditioner, hair masque, and this and it works wonders. My hair feels so nourished and moisturized without being oily. My hair has definitely grown longer too since I’ve been using it and taking hair growth pills. I relax my hair every month so I needed something to keep it from being damaged and brittle."
15,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Little goes a long way !,"Just like all of my other Shea moisture products, smells great and leaves my hair feels and looking good."
16,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,it WORKS!,This stuff definitely works wonders. It also has a pretty nice smell to it which is great because you don't want to walk around with a head that wreaks. After a few weeks of using this product there was a noticeable difference.
17,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,I received a bottle with the customer protection/anti-tamper seal punched through,"I received a bottle with the customer protection/anti-tamper seal punched through, you can still see the remnants of the seal are still there. Disappointing. I tried to return for replacement. Says not eligible for a return."
18,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product,I have very dry itchy scalp I've use products in the past and nothing seem to last more than a day and my scalp would be dry again the next day. This product wonderful I used it the first night I got it. First a little bit of this goes a very long way. Second it smells great. Third as I put the oil on my scalp the dryness and itchiness immediately was gone and stayed gone. My hair is soft and manageable now.
19,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Broken protective seal,"I genuinely enjoy Shea Moisture products and use them regularly, I have some pretty curly hair. I was looking forward to trying this product but when I opened the bottle, twisting off the plastic top, the seal was already perforated and some of the oil spilled. Now the bottle is covered in it. It smells nice and I still want to try it, the ingredients list looks great, I just am not appreciating that the seal was already busted before I could even open it (without having it get everywhere)."
20,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OIL, OIL, OIL!!!",Very oily.  Oil stains all over my pillows.  Will not be ordering this again.
21,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it the oil, but....","Just received my bottle and from the reviews I immediately did a THOROUGH inspection of the box and the bottle. There were no punctures anywhere! Everything was sealed as it’s supposed to be. Thank goodness! So I’m not sure if the issue of the tampered bottles was resolved or I just got lucky. Either way, I received mine in perfect condition and this feels amazing on my dry scalp. I plan to buy more!Update: 3/6/19So I felt lucky about got a bottle that wasn’t “tainted” and decided to quickly buy 2 more. Well, they were just delivered and BOTH bottles had the seal punctured and there were strange red bubbles in there. They had also spilled. Obviously I won’t be using either one of these!I want to point out something interesting. The first single bottle I ordered was fine. Packaged perfectly with the seal entact. That bottle was shipped from the fulfillment center in Colorado. The 2 extra bottles that I ordered after that shipped from the fulfillment center in Washington state. Now...as soon as I saw my 2 bottles were being shipped from a different fulfillment center I didn’t feel confident in receiving untampered with bottles. And sure enough, I didn’t receive good ones. I would be interested to know if others have this in common with their bad bottles coming out of Washington state?Anyway, I got lucky with the first bottle. Even though it’s half the price than in stores, I would rather pay more money to know that I’m getting an untampered with, quality product in a bottle."

26,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Left my hair feeling dried out,First hair oil that left my hair feeling dried out by the next day. You shouldn’t need to apply oil to your hair daily. Not for me.
27,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn't Sealed At All,I am not going to try it because it was not sealed at all!  I opened the top and there was just a few strips of the inner protective seal left.  It looks as if someone ripped it off!! I was looking forward to using this product and I am so disappointed.

32,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells good, drys out scalp",I’m a huge fan of SheaMoisture products but this one missed it mark. It smells amazing but it dried out mines & my 3 yr. old daughter’s scalp. We had dry patches all throughout our heads. I had to wash both of our hair & treat our scalps with grape seed oil to rehydrate them. I will continue to use our other SheaMoisture products but I definitely will NOT purchase this again.
33,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,"PRODUCT HAS LINGERING, SWEET ODOR","Castor oil does wonders for my hair. I thought this product would have been great, but I could not get past the lingering, sweet odor. I found it to be very nauseating."

But the upside is that it smells great. I’ll update my review in a few weeks or soUPDATE: I have been using this oil for almost two months now and I’ve seen a change in length, texture, and feel. My hair is thicker, smells great, soft, and it grew about 3-4 inches. It might come in a small bottle but it lasts a pretty good amount of time. I will be buying more!"
37,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,"One of the bests if not the best hair oil I have tried, your ends will love this and it might be helping my hair grow. I love using this before wash day but you could totally use it to style mixed with a bit of curling cream. If this comes in a bigger bottle, I need it. Also, use this on your stretch marks, amazing."
38,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Watery,"This oil is really watery and definitely does not moisturize my hair at all. The next day after putting this on, my hair turned very dry and brittle ."
39,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Made hair fall out,"I used this product once and after it had been on my scalp for about 3 days, it was time for my hair to be washed.

The Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, masque, conditioner, and leave in is great. This oil appears to be different or changed.. It is thinner and seem to have less peppermint oil in it.. Used it twice and it set my scalp on fire due to the itching...."
41,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would not purchase again,I was looking for an oil to put in my hair mainly concentrated on the ends because they tend to be dry. The first problem I had with this product is that once you open it the actual tip where the oil should come out is completely sealed off. Cutting it off with scissors was super difficult since it’s thick plastic and then it can cause lots of leaking because the cap doesn’t fit very well. It’s not very easy to spread around and will leave your hair almost crunchy feeling if you leave too much in one place.
42,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Came half empty looks like it’s been opened and used,"The media could not be loaded.

46,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for curly hair moisture and scalp,"I had a dry, itchy scalp for years and this worked  like a miracle.

When I tell you this product has slowly regrown my edges!! I recently started to use this, about 1 month now and my hairline is alive again.

The bottle isn't huge, but despite feeling like I'm dousing my scalp, it doesn't look like I've used any.It does make my hair greasy so I typically use it the day before washing. I use New Wash which isn't a shampoo or cowash, yet the oil washes cleanly out without issue."
55,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tremendously satisfying.  Love it,I absolutely love shea moisture product.  I'm NEVER disappointed.  This was a great price too compared to buying in store.  In store its $14.  I do like yo budget.  With this product it's not oily.  And it does produce growth.

58,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Icky,"I bought this product because my hair is becoming very dry.  The product smells terrible.  It smells like cotton candy mixed with some kind of scent one would use to cover up horrific odors .  Used as directed, it actually made my hair feel rougher and  more frizzy than ever.  I would truly discourage anyone from buying this."
59,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh.,I used this for a long time and saw a slight difference with the growth of my hair. I primarily used it on my hairline around my forehead just for some more growth and thickness there. I saw slight growth but not too much. The scent is alright it could be better. Overall it's okay. Didn't do much for me.

Not as thick as castor oil and can be used on dry hair without feeling greasy or heavy
62,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Probably works but overpowering smell,"I just can't use this oil because of the scent. Why add so much fragrance SheaMoisture? I don't get it, because overall this oil has good ingredients, unfortunately i'll never know if it works because the smell is very strong, lingers, and is overpowering. And this is coming from someone who likes to drench myself in Pink Sugar and Flowerbomb perfume, so you know i like overpoweringly sweet fragrances!"

I was SUPER excited to try this product UNTIL it arrived. The box looked like it had been opened and then taped back to seal.

I'm trying it for the first time and it's too soon to really see a difference. But here's what I do like so far:  good smell,  not sticky (although it's really thin so I added pure organic castor oil to it) easily absorbable. I put it on either before bed or in the morning and it doesn't leave my hair oily,  only initially but then it absorbs. I also like that you only need to use a little at a time so it looks like it will last me a long time. I'll add that I'm using this line of products now including the shampoo,  conditioner, and edge control. Just fyi"

I rarely shop on here, I canceled prime and I’m very careful about checking my account because I’m CONSTANTLY charged for things I don’t receive or old subscriptions I’ve canceled.

This was scheduled to arrive on the 18th and got it on the 13th... FAST. I initially thought this is to small for the price but a little goes a long way cause there's no need for a lot of this. A few drops is enough. I massaged my scalp with my finger tips but man this is making my scalp itch sooooo much when I first put it on but it's slowly going away. It's smells so good just like the masque. My hair does fell nice and soft after using this. I'm a black girl who's always been natural with 4b/c, mid back length hair. My hair is long and thick I just want it to get even longer cause it seem like the growth is stopping. I do have a lot of heat damage to my ends and a lot of shedding but no breakage fr but I trim hair every couple month. I plan to use it as a hot oil treatment on my hair wash days 1x weekly and 1x between just applying a few drops then massage.(I'll get back with an update with growth rate)"

334,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's Okay,"My hair isn't very fond of oils. But, that isn't the fault of the product.  For me, this oil is best used as a pre-shampoo treatment.  Otherwise, it tends to make my hair hard.  I tend to need something more substantial, i.e. a hair butter, for my hair. Otherwise, it has a nice fragrance, is easy to apply, and does give my hair a nice shine.  I just won't be using it as my daily, go-to haircare product."

362,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype,First off let me just say I love Shea moisture products! They have really helped me with my transition to natural hair and I especially love this line from Shea moisture. I have 3b/3c thick curls. I find this product to be more of an oil than a serum and while the product is good it's not what I want as looking for and too thick and also you don't get a lot of product for the price. This product reminds me of doo gel but at least I get more product in it. It is also mixed with several different oils and I realized I get go to my local beauty supply store and buy all those oils for cheap. Plus I would get way more product if I did it that way. In short there's nothing special about this product.

391,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a long way...,"I have naturally curly hair that is now just frizzy/wavy with out styling. I am Caucasian and my hair is naturally slightly coarse. I am currently repairing my hair from years of bleaching it. I L O V E this stuff. Just from one use (after my shower I put a bit on my damp ends/I don't blow dry my hair) I noticed a difference. A little honestly does go a long way, too much will make your hair oily. Unless you are trying to soak your hair in it (for an overnight thing) only use a bit to barely coat the ends of your hair. I am personally using it on my ends only since that is where the damage is and I don't want my roots to be weighed down. The smell is not overwhelming to me, but I am not scent sensitive at all. It has a very subtle sweet smell. Will be purchasing this again when ever I am out, but I think that will be awhile since I don't use too much."

417,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Basically, this is the only oil I'll be using from now on.","It goes on smoothly, and has a nice viscosity. I use this on my moustache and beard, and it definitely does a good job. The mark of a good hair oil is absorption, and that's exactly what this does. After a few hours, my hair still feels moist, but the oily residue has mostly gone away, meaning that it has absorbed into skin and hair. The real proof is in the pudding however, and as far as growth rate and hair strength are concerned, I have noticed amazing improvements since using this oil. Basically, this is the only oil I'll be using from now on."
418,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Product. Great results,"A bit pricey for the size, but it arrived on time and it smells great. PERFECT FOR DRY SCALP/HAIR, IF YOU ALREADY HAVE GREASY HAIR DO NOT PURCHASE THIS OIL. I have very dry scalp, especially in the winter time and I found this as the perfect product because it moisturizes the scalp and leaves the hair feeling soft. I actually bought the whole line of Shea Moisture with JBCO and it was WELL WORTH IT. My hair dresser even fell in love with it especially the masque. Just the smell alone will have you falling in love with this product. I highly recommend this product due to its natural/organic ingredients (NO PARABENS, NO SULFATES, NO MINERAL OIL) and the excellent results. I promise you won't be disappointed."

438,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,"I had been using jamaican black castor oil for a few weeks, but the smell was horrendous.  So when I saw this product, I was skeptical, but I had to try it.  I love it.  It does wonders for my hair.  It feels so soft and healthy.  But beware, it is heavily scented.  That could be a problems for some, but fortunately, not for me. I think this serum smells absolutely *heavenly*.  I love smelling it on myself during the day.  I will definitely buy this again."
439,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Open upon arrival,I don't understand how so many of these could be delivered open it is not make any sense I even read the review and said to myself well that's not going to happen and ordered it anyway and then I got it and low and behold the seal is broken open not even sure if this is the right product and there is some white stuff floating around in it
440,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of my favourite Sheamoisture product,"This is one of my favourite Sheamoisture product. Even the box smells good! Not only did this help regrow the thin spots in my natural hair, but it made my hair grow way faster and thicker! I used this oil for my inversion and I grew a whopping 2 inches of hair in a week. I would totally recommend this product to anyone, no matter how healthy or unhealthy your hair is. Also, it didn't leave my hair feeling greasy, or itchy like a lot of other products do. I love it!"
441,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,It smelled wonderful initially and my thinning edges actually got fuller,"It smelled wonderful initially and my thinning edges actually got fuller. However, it started smelling awful after a while.  I'm hoping it's because I left the cap off.  If that was the reasoning, I will buy more and rate it a 5.  Otherwise, I will try other brands.  I had to discard this one after the awful skunk smell (although I don't know what a skunk smell like, I've heard it's awful)"
442,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Smell so good but drys my hair out !,This makes my hair dry!!!!!  I haven’t seen any growth as of yet and been using it for 3weeks now .
443,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Small and Pricey but Sooo Good!!,This product smells so good. I wish they had one for my body cause it's yummy.  The bottle is very small for the price. The oil is not thick like real Jamaican Castor oil but it definitely moistures my dry hair. I reallly like this oil and I think I may use it for a very long time. Glad I found it.
444,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken seal,"When I got it the seal was broken. I realize that, that is a common problem with alot of people. The outside plastic was seal so why would the bottle seal be broken. That's weird and fishy. Going to return it. So disappointed because I was looking forward to using it"

450,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It has a ""candy"" like smell that does not go away","In terms of effectiveness is does smooth cuticles, however, on my very thick, curly, porous hair it did not penetrate well at all.  The smell was also very offensive to me.  It has a ""candy"" like smell that does not go away.  I've decided to use this as  weekly deep oil treatment applied to a wet scalp."

452,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Four Stars,Love the product. Wish it came in a bigger package.
453,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,It does smell like play doh just like the other products in Shea ...,I have not noticed any changes in my hair (it hasn't gotten thicker or longer). I bought this thinking that it will make my edges a little fuller but after 2 months I haven't seen any improvement. Plus I do not think it's worth the price for this small bottle when I could make my own larger mixture using jbco and rosemary oil. Definitely will be making my own mixture and will not repurchase.P.S. It does smell like play doh just like the other products in Shea Moisture's JBCO line
454,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,This came with the seal already broken!
455,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff.,"Good stuff .. I only apply it to my hair cause its a little to heavy for my scalp and causes mild itching. My hair strands love it, but for my scalp I will stick with my organic coconut oil &cold pressed castor oil only. I will buy this oil again though. I get it at Target for a better price."
456,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I dig it.,This is the best product for scalp psoriasis next to LUSH henna. It cleared up my scalp immediately and I have noticed that the hair quality at the crown of my hair has improved. (I use to have some breakage in the middle of my hair and I was embarrassed to wear my hair down.) Easy application. It has a smooth feel similar to that of natural coconut or grape seed oil.

458,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Smells nice and completely repaired my daughters hair which was coarse and poofy.

459,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice lubricant. Spreads well on hair and scalp,"Nice lubricant. Spreads well on hair and scalp, a little goes a long way. I love this line of products. Everything does what it says it will. My ends look healthy and I'm happy"
460,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Shea moisture gets an A+,This hair oil/serum absorbs into my scalp quickly. Unlike some other castor oils ( that can weigh your hair down ) this one is lightweight. It smells great. My hair is not shedding with this product. And my hair usually sheds like crazy! So this is a HUGE accomplishment for me :)
461,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for hair loss,Noticeable hair growth after two weeks use. Great product for hair loss.
462,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hair growth,"I got the worst haircut of my life and desperately needed something to grow my hair out. I read about scalp massages for growth and used this. My hairdresser basically completely buzzed off the sides of my hair to the point where I looked bald, but within a week of using this (along with vitamins and good nutrition) for scalp massages the hair completely filled in.I also noticed that it helped with some sores on my scalp and healed them completely. This product has a noticeable smell (like vanilla, almond, peru balsam) which I happen to like, but it works well so the smell shouldn't be a factor in whether or not you use this product. If you want soft, strong, fast-growing hair and a healthy scalp definitely use this! Also you can get this cheaper elsewhere.. I got this at Ulta half off in a bogo deal."
463,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I used for a hot oil treatment. I'm not sure if I would use this daily as it may weigh down hair. The top does make it easier to line scalp only though. The smell is unique: a mixture of Play Doh, cotton candy and baby powder. A very soft scent but does linger. It absorbed very quickly into scalp. Cheaper at drug store as well."
464,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Very goog product
465,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,I really recommend it

468,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,1.0 out of 5 stars,TRASH!! DONT BUY!! No Refund if Damaged,"I like Shea Moisture products and wanted to try this one since I've heard so many good things about this particular oil. When the bottle arrived the seal was damaged, it's like someone purposely punch a hole in it. I wanted to return the item or get a refund, but unfortunately I can't. I should of listened to the reviews and not order this product. I would not recommend buying this product from Amazon!!!! I know they can do better at making sure they send out better products, and I know they don't have to unscrew the top just to ship me this product. It shouldn't have been opened to begin with. I will upload pictures when I can get my phone to connect to my computer."
469,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs a more secure top to the bottle.,I got this to use on the dry ends of my hair. It smells divine and it will last me forever since I only need a small amount. Unfortunately the cover tip is not at all secure and I couldn't bring this along on a trip because I knew it would leak everywhere. It would be so much better with a different style top to it.
470,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its not overly oily,My hair is very dry especially in the winter when I really have trouble keeping my hair hydrated. I love this oil because it adds moisture to my hair without being overly oily which can be a problem for a lot of hair oils. I use this oil with my other SheaMoisture products and it has been working great so far.
471,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT HAIR STRENGTHENING PRODUCT!,"Decided to try the Shea Moisture Jamaican Castor Oil based on the positive reviews.  I'm VERY pleased with the results!  My hair had become very dry, brittle, thinning, and breaking off due in part to prescription medications I had been taking for a severe skin allergic reaction,  as well as hormonal imbalances.  I'd previously tried numerous types of hair treatment products, as well as vitamins, but none seemed to stop the breakage, or the daily fall out.  But once I used this product, along with my usual haircare products, the breakage stopped within a couple days!  Amazingly my hair has finally started to grow back, thicker, and stronger than before!  I use the Serum daily (usually before bed, and cover with a satin sleep cap).  The scent is pleasant, with a tropical coconut-like aroma.  A little goes a long way, so recommend starting with small amounts, and massage into hair and scalp before combing and brushing through.  Leaves hair soft, and moisturized.  Would definitely recommend."
472,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Trying a new product.,It smells good. Came with the SEAL OPEN as everyone claimed it did. But I used it. I use it before bed on my roots. It's oily as you apply but not greasy oily. By day the oil has absorbed and hair is easy to style. Makes my hair HEALTHY LOOKING. Only gave four stars so far cause I need to use longer to see if it does make hair grow. Will be back with update.
473,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good results,I started noticing hair growth almost two weeks of use!!! I'm so glad that it's working. Thank you Shea Moisture❤️

475,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent and good ratings on EWG!,"I recently found out I have an autoimmune disease and I had been using the Shea Moisture High Porosity shampoo and conditioner.  The high-porosity conditioner had a few questionable ingredients in it (according to EWG) so I stopped using conditioner altogether (which I thought would be a huge disaster) and started using this hair oil (which has largely safe ingredients according to EWG) after shampooing instead and my very, very dry kinky-curly hair has looked and felt pretty great!"
476,SheaMoisture Hair Serum Oil for Damaged Hair Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Oil with Shea Butter 2 oz,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the feel of the oil but not the size of the bottle,"I like the feel of the oil but not the size of the bottle. This oil is really light but seems to hold in the moisture or oil in the hair and scalp. Doesn't feel thick and gunky like most oils do. The only thing that I really dislike is the size of the bottle that the oil is in.  The bottle is super small. I guess I didn't pay attention to the size of the bottle as far as the fl oz in the bottle. Not sure if I'll be ordering this again, if the price remains or increases."

The addition of the conditioner make my hair feel amazing. This size is 3.3 ounces more than sold in stores.The bigger plus is; I ordered this shampoo Monday late in the overnight and received it Wednesday afternoon. This is my favorite Shea Moisture shampoo which sells out quickly in stores near me, and I had it delivered to my house in one day.  No driving in the snow, slushing through the parking lot in a mask to stand 6 feet from people."

My hair has been through a lot; ironing daily, head and shoulders shampoo daily and no conditioner cause i thought it would make my hair oilier (yikes); bleach; tight slick bun hairstyles with hairspray; SUN IN; etc etc etc you name it bro. This shampoo is amazing my hair is usually oily af and i can’t last a day without washing it. it’s also super dry in the ends, but this shampoo is super moisturizing but doesn’t make my scalp oily or heavy it actually has lifted my dandruff and has kept it super clean now i can go at least 3 days no washing. Thank God. I also use it with the jamaican black mask as my conditioner and their leave in conditioner after i get out the shower. buy it and give it a few washes you’ll see and feel a difference."

It smells great and leaves my hair soft after the shower. I color my hair regularly (red-constant up keep!) and use the blow drier and flat iron almost daily, so my hair needs something that can help repair the damage that I'm doing as well as keep the color nice. This whole line of products are amazing. definitely recommend!"

Now I can wash it every other (or even every third) day, and it looks great. Soft and shiny, not frizzy or greasy or staticky. Love the nice thick lather, and it doesn’t smell weird. Plus, it’s natural - nothing toxic. Love it so much that I’ve brought several other products from this brand for myself and my kids. Great stuff!"

6,"Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Shampoo w/ Shea Butter, Peppermint, & Apple Cider Vinegar 16.3 fl oz. (482ml) (2 Pack)",5.0 out of 5 stars,My god these smell and feel good,Only used it for 2 days and it’s a huge improvement over my head and shoulders 2-1. Leave my hair extremely soft almost like I had a relaxer in my hair. It was referred to me by a Uber drive whom had impressively clean and healthy looking beard. I bought this along with the leave in conditioner which is equally impressive.
7,"Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Shampoo w/ Shea Butter, Peppermint, & Apple Cider Vinegar 16.3 fl oz. (482ml) (2 Pack)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Ever!,"I have to say that this is the best shampoo (and the conditioners-leave in and wash out-are too!) I have ever found. The price is VERY reasonable for a quality hair product(s)! My first purchase was for the trio of products and I found that there is so much of the leave in (which I use each time I wash my hair along with the wash out conditioner) conditioner that my second and third purchases were for additional bottles of the shampoo and wash out conditioner as the leave in looks like it will last longer. You don't need much to thoroughly wash your hair and it lathers up really well. For me another plus is the scent....being allergic to flowery scents it is sometimes hard to find hair products that don't give me a headache within minutes of using. This one has a very earthy scent. I just cannot say enough about the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore products. Even my salon stylist was impressed at how much moisture my hair had. Being over 65 and having gray hair as well as ""chemo"" damaged hair after cancer these products have done wonders for the silkiness of my hair. Highly recommended to anyone!"

I gave up normal shampoos with sulfates in them and switched to this. Wow. My hair got really soft after the first few uses, and then it began to grow! It's not tangly anymore when I brush it. 2 different people noticed in the same week that my hair actually looked healthy. My mom, who I hadn't seen in awhile came for a visit and asked what in the world I did to my hair and so I let her use some and she liked it and went out and bought her own. Very good stuff."

Lol the smell is absolutely amazing and the way it leaves your scalp feeling clean and amazing.  I tend to have dry itchy scalp and this shampoo superseded my expectations on calming that issue down. I have tried all kinds of over-the-counter medicated shampoo’s but this one is the real deal and it leaves your hair with the best smell.

10,"Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Shampoo w/ Shea Butter, Peppermint, & Apple Cider Vinegar 16.3 fl oz. (482ml) (2 Pack)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best shampoo in the world,"This shampoo is amazing. I have been using it since 2013 (ish) when I started transitioning from relaxed to natural hair. It worked perfectly in my relaxed hair and then in my half natural/half relaxed hair, and now in my type 3C curly hair. It cleans my scalp and I do believe it helped me grow my hair faster. Every time I try to change it for another shampoo (to try new stuff), I end up buying this one again.The only thing that is not PERFECT about this shampoo, is the smell. I mean, it has a light scent that does not stay on hair at all, but I think it could smell a tiny bit better. But, yeah, I totally recommend it to everyone."

I have thinning hair and researched the ingredients to stop hair loss and maybe, just maybe, grow some of it back. I don't do the pills, ointments and what have you that has major side effects. I don't claim this shampoo will grow your hair so fast that you can braid it or get dreads and go rasta fa ri!...lolWhat I do know from using it is that I don't see my hair follicles abnormally all over the sink or tub drain. my hair smells good, soft and manageable, not weighed down, and noticeably ""fuller"".Best thing of all, no side effects...lolI'll keep using it."

After over 10 yrs, this is honestly the only product that has helped my baby fine/incredibly thin hair grow! However, it does nothing to help strengthen it or reduce the oiliness of my hair/scalp but I am still impressed. Although it still falls out at the same unhealthy rate , it has grown faster than it ever has before and for me, that's more than I could've hoped for."

The quality of the shampoo is really great, especially for my hair. My hair is very dry and damaged. It gives moisture to my hair, it softens and helps with breakage. You just have to keep using it and it gradually stops the breakage.I have always used Jamaican Black Castol, but it only comes in 13 oz. which doesn't last. Hopefully they'll start keeping the 16 oz."

Deciding to give the product another shot, I read the ingredients list and saw that the fragrance was changed to an ""essential oil blend"".

It makes me really sad that I can't use something that works because I'm allergic to most fragrances in hair products. I hoped that because it was ""natural fragrance"" I'd be okay."

(482ml) (2 Pack)",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty Good, But Tangles My Hair Badly","I have 55 year old fine African-America, medium lengthen hair that is usually naturally curly from roots to ends when wet; fine, thin, light and feathery after pressing with straightening comb.  I also have vitiligo on my scalp.  Before, I used Suave for years.  After shampooing & conditioning with Suave, it relaxed some of the ends of my strands, curls went limp and straight.  Enough said.  After using this shampoo and conditioner for about 3 months, I noticed that it helped with hair growth especially if I kept my ends clipped about once a month.  I also feel as if it is thickening my hair shaft I think.  I noticed that the texture of my hair was restored to its original curly-at-the-ends-when-wet state.  That one surprised me!  What I do NOT like about the shampoo is that it leaves my hair incredibly tangled--so tangled that even with the gentlest teasing with my fingers while being conditioned with same brand, it pulls out a lot of hair.  A lot!  I hurts too much to use a wide-tooth detangling comb.  In fact, I am beginning to feel concerned about further use of the shampoo.  I'm going to try the same brand but their detangling shampoo.  Overall, I do recommend this brand.  Although I recommend it for black hair, use the shampoo with caution.  Perhaps the shampoo was  a little too strong for my hair type.  I will try their other shampoo products before totally giving up."

(482ml) (2 Pack)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not As Special As It Seems,"I liked this shampoo, but I didn't love it. The thing is: this shampoo, at least to me, isn't designed to be used regularly. With it having apple cider vinegar in it, this is great as a once-a-month or bi-weekly wash to help rid of excessive scalp buildup, so by nature, it will be drying. But use it on a more regular basis, and it's only going to be counterproductive. That's not the reason why I'm giving it a ""meh"" rating though: I think in general I just wasn't impressed by it overall. I wish it had more of a smell, and that it did more as promised on the label. While it's a great at ""stripping"" the scalp and hair, it doesn't really do much else, honestly. And since this is very watery, it also doesn't last that long, either.Maybe some will love it, and maybe others can use this regularly without problems, but I'd only stick to this once a month or bi-weekly. When I run out of this stuff, I'm not really planning on buying more, though. This shampoo is just okay, nothing as special as you'd hope."

It seems to be the only brand that is cruelty free, sulfate free, mostly natural ingredients, all while not making my scalp too dry. I have an especially sensitive scalp when it comes to shampoo. For a while, I was using the Shea Moisture dandruff shampoo, which worked pretty well. I wanted to find something with a bit more of a pleasing scent, though, so I picked this up to try it. Maybe it's because of the apple cider vinegar in it, but it really seems to do the trick! I don't have dryness or itchy scalp after using it regularly. It still get a tiny bit a flaking, but it's noticeably diminished compared to what it used to be. I switch off sometimes between this and the dandruff shampoo as a preventative. This is pretty much my go-to shampoo now!"

I also use this on my dog and it helped calm his skin and regrow hair, but the chunks don’t mix when I rub into his coat. Maybe the Amazon storage facility isn’t climate controlled.
