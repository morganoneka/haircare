0,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but a bit of a warning","I really liked this product! It was great for my hair and I noticed that it would feel less oily even the day after using it. I normally wash daily and have oily, thin hair (type 2b-c). I am hesitant to order it again because I ordered the larger bottle version through the Uncle Funky‚Äôs website, and I found that it was entirely a different formula than what this smaller bottle had, and left my hair a tangled mess before I conditioned it massively. Since I don‚Äôt know if Uncle Funky‚Äôs has just changed the formula for the shampoo entirely, or if I happened to get a bad batch (and their website didn‚Äôt have contact information), I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars and a bit of a warning. I would love to use the first version of the product again, though. Absolutely the best shampoo I‚Äôve ever used."
1,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this shampoo!!,I will forever use this kind of shampoo til I find something better. (hard to do) I love the way it smells while I shower and how it leaves my bathroom smelling so good too! it for sure makes my scalp tingle if I leave it in for about 5 minutes which I looooove cause 1. it feels really good and 2. it really cleans the oils and sweat from my hair!! It also leaves my hair suuuuuper SOFT and gets my curls POPPIN!
2,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,best ever,"Amazing stuff!  I have dry, thin, low porosity, straight hair.  I can use this without conditioner which is a first for me.  It almost isn't strong enough to get rid of all the grease, but I would prefer that to over drying!"
3,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Product,I had a Really Dry itchy scalp and just received my order today and used it and my hair is no longer Dry and itchy Thank God üíØI will say my hair was so tangled after use it did not detangle my hair but that's okI will definitely order againProbably next time off The Actual website to see if there is a differenceAlso when I used it I wet my hair and left on for 5 min and it's so refreshing and smells good üëçüèº

11,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleanses hair very well with a small amount of the shampoo!,Shampooing hair! It's an excellent shampoo. You don't have to use a lot to cleanse hair. It has menthol as one of the ingredients which makes scalp tingle I love that feeling. It feels so good! It's very concentrated!

12,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It does what it says. Simple!,I suffer from a severe itchy scalp & this product definitely soothed the itch without leaving my hair completely stripped. Officially keeping this shampoo in my wash day regimen.
13,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best Shampoo Out,I‚Äôve been using this shampoo for the past year now and love it! It‚Äôs the only shampoo that really cleans my hair without stripping it. Hair feels moisturized and clean after washing with this!
14,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sensation,"This shampoo is great, it easily remove my build up and I feel like it detox my scalp."
15,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great products,I liked the scent very much and the ingredients used helped cleanse my scalp more easily
16,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Probably‚Äã one of the best shampoos I've ever used. It tingles your scalp and leaves its squeaky clean. Should be in every curly girls hair stash.
17,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,"Love, love this item! Will buy again!"
18,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs a great product!,Shampoo gives you a thoroughly cleansed feeling to your scalp.
19,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,Love it
20,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Go buy Come Clean instead,"Not a good clarifying cleanser! You'll barely feel a tingle. It's so watered down. This product now contains several silicones!!!!!!! The original owners are probably screaming at how bad this product line has become. I'd recommend Egyptian Wheatgrass by Qhemet Biologics for ""squeaky"" clean hair, followed by QB's conditioner or Come Clean by Kinky Curly for a gentle clarifier that does not strip."
21,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Super Shampoo/Cleanser,Natural products; cleans very well; smells amazing
22,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Funky is right!,"Really good non-foaming shampoo/cleanser. Gets rid of product build up without stripping, and it‚Äôs great for a mid-week refresh. My only serous complaint is that it smells a little... well, funky. And not in a good way. It‚Äôs funky like an old hippie. Not really what I want my hair to smell like."
23,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,New fav,I'm really enjoying this shampoo It makes your hair feel squeaky clean just like it's supposed to work.
24,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like this it seems to really get the product build ...,I really like this it seems to really get the product build up out of my hair. I will say it makes it a little dryer feeling when I finish it then what I used to use but once I condition it's fine.
25,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural,"Great, for my hair, I don't have to put chemical  in my hair. Natural  is the best"
26,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,That it's a great product with good ingredients that were needed for my Natural Hair.,I use it as a Co-Wash for my natural hair.  It really does make it squeaky clean and refreshing.
27,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This shampoo gets the job done.,Removing the buildup from my hair. YAY!
28,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Love it
29,"Squeaky Clarifying Cleanser, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,scent,I love it you can use it on dreads as well it‚Äôs a great shampoo for product buildup I do recommend only using it maybe every 2 months cause it does strip your hair the scent smells so good & feel excellent on scalp
0,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,1.0 out of 5 stars,LIES ABOUT INGREDIENTS! CURLY GIRLS STAY AWAY!,"I am so disappointed in Uncle Funkys products. I wanted to like their products but just can‚Äôt considering they straight up lie to your face about the ingredients. If you have curly hair like me, LOOK AT THEIR LABELS FIRST!Even though it says they are paraben, sulfate, and silicone free, they are not. They are LIARS! This product in particular has Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate AND Sodium C14-26 Olefin Sulfonate.I‚Äôve even found that their Richee Rich Hudrating Conditioner has Behentrimonium Metho Sulfate and AMODIMTHICONE!!! THAT IS NOT SILICONE FREE!!! How is a supposed ‚ÄúHydrating Conditioner‚Äù supposed to hydrate curly hair when you have a silicone blocking moisture?So incredibly disappointed and disgusted. Never buying again."
1,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the product hate the price!,"I love their products. What I don‚Äôt love is how they‚Äôve jacked up the prices during this Coronavirus crisis. Their moisturizer conditioner is the best. However, I will be looking for another product because it‚Äôs way too expensive."
2,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mediocre at best.,"I brought this because my hairstylist used it, and my hair turned out great.But that‚Äôs usually the case. Your hairstylist uses a product, and you use the same thing and get completely different results.I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a fan. The shampoo is a bit expensive, and I don‚Äôt see a noticeable difference. I began using it on my daughters hair. She has soft curly hair. I honestly believe whatever curly shampoo I use will do.So, I say all of this to say .... I don‚Äôt know if it is worth the money. But try it out and see. I tried the travel packet first, and was impressed. (It didn‚Äôt have the shampoo in it. Just the conditioning styling cream and styling cream. If it did I wouldn‚Äôt have brought the large bottle.)"
3,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go Natural with RICH AND FUNKY,Rich and Funky works very well for my very soft ringlet type natural curly hair. I can actually go a day without other products and my hair stays curly without too much frizz. I live in Florida so humidity is always a factor. LOL I don‚Äôt mind ‚Ä¶Rich and Funky and humidity go together
4,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lathers Very Nicely to Get Under Thick Coily/Kinky Hair,"This shampoo helps clean, detangle, and moisturize my thick 3c-4a hair."
5,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the smell,Didn‚Äôt leave my locs feeling overly squeaky clean and dried out. This shampoo smells like luxury hotel shampoo lol ü•∞ I will be repurchasing.
6,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff!,Love this! Smells amazing and makes my curls happy!
7,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,Product cleans the hair very well... love it
8,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Premium product,I like this line as a hair treatment. Started using when I lived in Houston. You can go cheaper but not better
9,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged,Package came open and bottle broken.
10,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Three Stars,"Not very moisturizing, but lathers up well when washing..."
11,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gentle Touch!,Makes the hair feel super conditioned!
12,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Great product
13,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Texture,It wasn't the right fit for my little ones hair texture.
14,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Proceed at your own risk.,Contains silicones!!! Period.
15,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Defective bottle,"This is a great shampoo.But though the bottle was packaged in its own plastic bag, a significant amount had seeped out, into the bag.In a pandemic, do I return it for a new one?"
16,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what i expected,"This shampoo smell good and it only take a little to make a lot of suds, but it left my hair very dry and brittle. It wasn't moisturizing at all."
17,Rich & Funky Moisturizing Shampoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Stars,Love this shampoo
0,Bye-Bye Buildup,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, TERRIBLE packing design","I have mostly 2C curls that go into large ringlets, that are SUPER dry and frizzy, and this product is AMAZING. It took out product buildup from my hair without being overly drying, and left my hair with enough slip to detangle and style outside of the shower without any issues. It actually felt BETTER the longer I let it sit I'm my hair while showing. This was an EXCELLENT cowash that really helps balance even my insanely dry hair.That being said.. The pump on this product has some weird design flaw with sealing that won't allow it to work. I have to just take the top off the pump and dump the product onto my hands to use it, because the seal on the top apparently broke or was never working in the first place. It's not the end of the world, I can obviously still get to the product, and I'm annoyed that I have to give a lower rating because of a mechanism fault, but.. Here we are.If you order this, know the product itself is great, but the bottle and pump design may suck and not work."
1,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will Take Build-Up Out of Hair,It WILL get rid of all the junk you've put in your hair. Just be sure to ADD the moisture back it or it will be VERY DRYING.
2,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like this conditioner.,"Love this stuff! Not a fan of the shampoo, but they really helps my daughter and I curls. I have 4C hair and she has 3C."
3,Bye-Bye Buildup,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the smell, hate the pump.","The product works well on my hair and smells amazing! However, the pump on the bottle is a challenge. I would love to see this product in a jar. I will keep buying occasionally because I do like it."
4,Bye-Bye Buildup,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt understand why it is called bye bye build up,Didn‚Äôt remove build up at all. My hair would be greasy by the next day.
5,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cowash,"Love this as a cowash, I feel like it definitely helps remove buildup and doesn't cause an itchy scalp. My hair feels very clean after using this."
6,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really great!,I really like this! Great to pre-detangle and leaves my natural hair soft and feeling clean and moisturized.
7,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans  hair  really good,This product  smells and cleans your hair good.
8,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome stuff,"i love this, i have 3c-4b hair and this product is the best co wash ive ever used. my hair is clean but not stripped and its just amazing"
9,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,UFD on a Roll with New Products,"This cleansing conditioner is very cleansing. One wouldn't think it with all of the oils, but the formulation is very cleansing, but moisturizing. I have a very sensitive scalp, and this works great to remove any build-up I may have accumulated over a few days! I've been using a well-known brand, but have been trying to find a no-poo cleanser that isn't drying and protein-free. I will repurchase this, and hope that they make it in a larger size. My favorite UFD products: Bye Bye Build-Up, Curly Magic (gel), and Heal & Renew moisture masque. These are so good!"
10,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for curly swimmers,This product works exceptionally well for my 4a gray natural coily curls.  It has been a staple used after swimming.  It‚Äôs very thick and moisturizes the hair well while removing product buildup.
11,Bye-Bye Buildup,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great co-wash,Love the way it gently cleanses without stripping my hair. It‚Äôs my go to produce on wash days.
0,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,It definitely works!,"I wear weaves and wigs and work out a lot and start smelling my hair even when other people don't ( or are too polite to say). This is a great product to use between washes. I gave the scent 3 stars because I'm a woman who's very into scents. However, the scent is such that both males and females can use it. It's kinda gender neutral. I used this product the first night I got it and right away my hair/scalp smelled better. But at first, it mainly smelled like the product. By the next morning, however, even the product smell was gone and my hair had no bad smells at all. This was after going to the gym all week and sweating a lot.  It really is a great product but I would say, especially to the fellas ( you know how you can be sometimesüôÇ) that this is NOT a substitute for washing your hair. You should still wash your hair on a regular basis; your scalp needs it. But does what it promises and will take unpleasant smells out of your hair."
1,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best product for what it‚Äôs meant for,"Wish they had a masculine smell for men with locs but this definitely does the job between retwist on starter locs. There‚Äôs absolutely no sweaty scalp smell at all, and I work in a warehouse with 100 degree plus temperatures......definitely worth buying, I don‚Äôt know why there‚Äôs bad reviews for this on her honestly"
2,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!! Great alternative to dry shampoo!!,"I was a die hard fan of dry shampoo for years UNTIL I started having tons of problems with dryness and irritation. It took me a long time to realize but the dry shampoo had been worsening my dry scalp.I took a long break from dry shampoo and would try and use it now and again but kept finding it would irritate my skin every time I'd use it. I still wanted to find an alternative for days I didn't have time to wash my hair and didn't want to be self conscious about odor.I saw some of the reviews on this product and was worried the smell would be too strong as I have a sensitive sense of smell and easily get nauseated. I tried this anyway and I'm so happy I did! The scent doesn't smell artificial at all, it smells like a nice light fruity/clean essential oil smell. Nothing juvenile, just nice and light. And let me tell you it really WORKS! It gets rid of any odors and just leaves a light fragrance instead. It doesn't smell like oily hair and perfume. It neutralizes odors very well!It is an oil so it won't soak up anything but I don't mind this very much, I use this when I probably have another day or two before washing and plan on wearing sleeker styles anyway. Its not too heavy and doesn't weigh down my hair. I have thick coarse hair and it works very well for me.I recommend this to my friends and family. Will definitely be repurchasing!:)"
3,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap fragrance,I've only used this product once but can agree with other reviewers on the fact that it can get rid of that particular sweaty/musty odor on an oily scalp (like mine) a couple of days after washing.  My only gripe is its fragrance hence my two-star deduction. It smells like a cheap flowery body mist straight out of the dollar store.  I wish they would've formulated it with a more subtle natural fragrance.
4,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff,"Amazing product. It gets rid of excess oil as well as odors or smoke, pollutants and dirty hair.  It does all this but doesn‚Äôt dry out the ends of your hair. Keep this around for times you need to freshen your hair but can‚Äôt wash it."
5,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely Defunkafied. Love it so far,"This stuff is bomb. Seriously, I workout abut 5-6 times a week and my hair is always in a protective style. Though I wash my scalp while my hair is in braids. The sweat brings oder in my hair during the week. I just got this yesterday and I used it that same day and today. It is awesome. It brought moisture to my hair and boom, oder is gone. I don't smell anything at all. Awesome product."
6,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a Sophisticated Scent,"The smell!  Ugh.  The smell.  I could not abide by the fake-y juvenile candy-ness.  I was looking for something that I could spray on after hot yoga that would get me through till my shampoo.  As someone who wears expensive perfume, I couldn't take this smell on me.  I attempted to add some essential oil drops to the concoction to make it smell more grown-up, but no dice, that didn't work.  I ended up pouring it down the drain and recycling the bottle within a week of purchase.  I highly suggest you find a way to preview this scent in a store first, otherwise you may be stuck with it.  Also, please note that it contains castor oil.  I was looking for a neutral deodorizer, not more oily grease in my hair."
7,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works but not best smell,I bought this because my hair naturally stinks. It doesn‚Äôt hold any scent from shampoos or conditioners. It just always smells like hair and after a couple days that switches to an even more not so pleasant smell. My mom and aunt always complains my hair stinks so I bought this. Definitely takes away the hair smell but it could smell better. Smells like flowery air freshener. Does work though.
8,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Why am I just knowing about this product!,"I am an African American female with relaxed hair. I'm also a person that has always worked out and have always been a big sweater. I've inquired with various people about how to deal with my hair odor..I've been told to spray perfume on my hair -didn't work, I've been told to get a fragrance moisture didn't work. However, I have only used this products twice since I purchased it and it's a miracle worker. I spray it on my hair after my workout and TA-DAH:)"
9,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for refreshing scalp. Smells nice,"Works great for refreshing the scalp between washes. I prefer it to dry shampoo because it's moisturizing, so I can spray it all over my hair if I want to, and it doesn't leave any noticeable residue or buildup. The scent is decently strong, but not overpowering. It could be an issue if you're sensitive to scents. I think it smells nice, and it really does seem to remove odors from the hair/scalp instead of just covering them up."
10,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,No thank you,"I don't wear a protective style. I also have relaxed hair. So I thought I'd give this a try to extend till my next shampoo. This product thickened my roots and left a build up.  It didn't help with dandruff either. However, it did take the odor away and soothe itching momentarily. Not worth the $15 I paid for it in my opinion. I returned it."
11,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Stay away. Not at all what is promised!,"I read so many good reviews, so I bought this product. It is a big waste of money. The smell is strong and not very pleasant. Plus it does not do anything. It doesnt soothe the scalp and I dont feel refreshed.  It just makes the scalp more greasy by the end of the day. I feel highly cheated."
12,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,No more smoky hair!,"Works so much better than expected.  I smoke, and I hate my hair smelling like I've been through a fire.  I love this stuff! No more smoky hair smell.  I can just spray as much as I need and I'm good to good.  Use it any time I smoke so my hair smells clean all day.  Love it love it love it."
13,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells terrific!!,I am so glad that I found this product. I love to support black businesses. I will definitely be looking into more of these products. I only spray my braids every 4-5 days. The scent last that long and even longer. Soft scent but definitely can smell it! Love love love!
14,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Product sort of changed,"June 2021 review: Longtime fan of this product. I had not been able to find this particular freshener for quite some time in the stores. Even on here, it was not even a Prime eligible item for a good bit. I really wanted the spray because I've been back in the gym really hard lately and like to stay fresh from head to toe. I searched and found it back as a Prime item. I was excited until I started using it. It's not giving the same freshness as before. It takes a lot more product to notice a difference. Is my hair or scalp smelly...no. But the product seems different. Not as vibrant and pleasing in it's aroma. Leaving 4 stars because I think I received a compromised bottle. I trusted in this brand and don't believe the brand is falling off. Just got a bad batch.Original review: I work out 6 days a week. Keeps my hair pleasantly fresh in between washes. The packaging was neat and the item is worth its value. It does what it says."
15,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hair pick me up!,"I use this after my workouts daily with my extensions. It works extremely well and has a nice scent that isn‚Äôt overbearing. I‚Äôve seen reviews where people don‚Äôt like the smell, but honestly it doesn‚Äôt smell bad at all, now if you used an extreme amount then yes, you would sting the nostrils. It‚Äôs a wet spray that goes on easy. You don‚Äôt have to use very much to get the results you want. It didn‚Äôt cause my hair to look greasy or flat after using, it just made it smell fresh after a long workout. I recommend this if you are looking for a quick hair pick me up from working out or just being outside and being sweaty."
16,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,"When I sprayed the product into the air I did not like the smell, but when I sprayed it on my hair it was completely different.I have long hair that picks up whatever order is around. This will keep me from needing to wash it every day."
17,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! Will definitely buy again and recommend.,I was looking for something to get the smell of smoke out of my braids because my friend and I went to a party where there was smoke. I am so happy that I found this product! It smells amazing and work like a charm. I will definitely buy again and recommend. Thank you
18,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, look no further!!!","I don't typically write reviews unless something really blows my socks off! This product does exactly what it says it does. It makes your hair smell amazing, even better than recently washed hair. I like the way my hair smells after spraying this stuff on it, that I not only use it after working out, I now use it all the time. Yes, even when my hair is still damp after being freshly washed. I just really love the way it smells!"
19,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for those humid days!,"I wear my hair in a natural hairstyle and I can honestly say that this stuff really works, especially when its humid!  I love the nice soft fragrance its not too strong and it doesn't conflict with wearing perfume. .  I really wish you would make a travel size."
20,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hair refresher I've ever used.,Smells so good and is not overbearing at all. I've tried alot on my locs and this is the best I've found in five years!
21,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent is off a bit...,"As much as I love this product, the bottles I got seemed old. The scent is off a bit from when I've purchased in a store."
22,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I was looking for,"I have crochet braids and work out 4-5 days a week. I can't always rinse or blow dry my hair after a workout and was getting a mildew smell. I tried astringent, which took away the smell, but dried my hair out, so this product is perfect. I've been using it a little over a month now after workouts, and no mildew smell, no dry, brittle hair, and I like the scent. Love it so far."
23,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Scent is NOT overpowering,Seems like the scent will be overpowering but it's not after it dries. Just smells clean. It doesn't burn an itchy scalp at all & feels very refreshing. Would definitely buy again instead of spending $30 on other brands.
24,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Loveeee it,This spray does exactly what it‚Äôs described to do. It refreshes your locs and makes ramen smell amazing. The scent is floral but not over powering it‚Äôs very pleasant and I get compliments on my hair smelling very nice when I give hugs. I would highly recommend. For us sisterloc sisters the nozzle is the right misting that we need so it doesn‚Äôt overly saturate our hair
25,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,I like it,"I have a mild case of seborrheic dermatitis and get a smelly scalp in between washes sometimes.  I section,  spray liberally on my scalp and massage in.  It really helps to moisturizer and absorb odors on the scalp.  Way better than a dry shampoo."
26,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product & price!!,"I have tried quite a few diffrent sprays for sweaty hair and This is by far the BEST!!! The smell is amazing!!  I have straight thick hair, and sweat wayy more than any woman should, this kills the smell, and makes my hair feel light and fresh, and again, I LOVE the fragrance!!  Wonderful product&purchase!! I'm soo glad I bought it bc I was initially hesitant not having the hair type it says it's good for.  Great value!! And I love knowing my purchase helps support better living conditions for woman!!"
27,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This lives up to the hype.  Amazing,This stuff is amazing to keep your hair fresh when wearing protective styles and can‚Äôt wash too often. Hair & head smelled great and no itching or irritation.  Even through heat & sweat!
28,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,AWESOME!,The stuff is off the hook. I have extensions and exercise. You can‚Äôt wash your hair a lot when you have extensions. Especially long ones. They have a tendency to want to get washed so to speak. LOL. But the stuff is awesome. I sprayed it on and my hair smells incredible. It doesn‚Äôt smell like build up it‚Äôs great. I would recommend this product to anybody of any hair type
29,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great smelling, dilute to save $!","This is a good overly powerful smelling product. Smells really good! So that I get the most use of this product and since there is a shipping fee, I will dilute this and add to about 3 tbs to a bottle of water with some garnier fructise hair oil and shake! This will make sure my curls are super enhanced by both this product for fragrance and the oil for healthy more awake looking curls!"
30,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Definite NO,I sprayed it on my braids when my hair was clean to do a test run. The initial smell was flowery and cheap. After a few minutes I noticed my head smelled like a wet dog. I can‚Äôt imagine what it would have smelled like if my hair wasn't already clean. Don‚Äôt waste your money. Seriously.
31,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a long way,"I really like the product. I normally wash my hair once per week. However now that I have braids in my hair I was  my hair once every other week. This really helps freshen things up. I love the scent, it‚Äôs definitely strong the first day of application but I like that. Once it dries, your scalp will a bit refreshed. The best thing about  product is that a little goes a long way. 5-8 sprays do the trick. Will def be repurchasing when I run out"
32,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job,Does the job for the smell but makes your hair kinda greasy or as if you apply hair spray
33,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Use on o100% hair.,It works but I like a more longer lasting fragrance.  Just a preference.

35,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed!,This stuff smells amazing. And it does eliminate odor just as it says it does. My hair picks up odor in the air and I can't wash my hair every single time it happens. This product solves that problem.
36,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,smells musty,"I like the product and it's lightness, but the smell is awful. It smells musty, like my grandmothers basement. It's so unpleasant that I will not be using it again. I don't understand why companies use such bad smelling fragrance in their products!"
37,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hairspray and toxic fragrance smell,"This smells like hairspray with a little less chemical impact, but cheap fragrance nonetheless. For all the organic and natural ingredients put into this, adding synthetic and toxic fragrance at the tail end makes this product moot for me. Feels more like masking order with perfume. Would have given more stars if there was light use of organic essential oils instead of fragrance so that the rest of the ingredients can speak for itself. My bad for not checking the ingredient more carefully."
38,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs good but,This product smells really good. It has a sweet but but not strong scent like some others that give you a headache. The only thing is that the scent doesn‚Äôt last all day but I‚Äôll buy it again.

43,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money!,"Tried this spray for the first time after the holiday weekend. Went to a lot of family functions and did a lot of heavy cooking and the smell from the cooking and the cigarette smoke was heavy in my hair. I have my hair in a protective style so, I pulled out the spray and used it on my hair the night before going back to work. Woke up the next morning and the cooking and cigarette smell was gone. Left behind a light scent that was not overpowering, the hair is just clean smelling. Nothing beats a good old-fashioned shampoo but when you can't, get this spray it is worth the money."

47,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Over Whelming Fragrance!,Really not sure how well the product works because I needed to wash it out of hair after a couple of hours. The perfume fragrance was just over whelming for me. Other's may find it acceptable.

143,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic product, multi use","This is one of the best beauty products I've ever used. I used this the first time when I had faux locs installed. The locs stayed in for 3 weeks, and this was the only product I used on my hair. My hair stayed moisturized and smelled fresh the whole time. I now use this between shampoos. Even after a workout my hair smells like the sweet floral scent of this product and stays fresh all day.I've recently had the MiraDry procedure done. I hardly sweat, but I still have a small amount of odor from time to time.  I no longer need traditional deodorant everyday, but I need a natural deodorant for those times when some protection is needed. I thought since this works so well with my hair I'd try it as a natural deodorant. Surprisingly it works very well. I tested it on a hot sunny day while running errands. When I came home I expected I'd have a bit of odor, but I didn't!I love a product that works well, but this goes above and beyond. I couldn't be happier with the purchase."
144,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,I prefer sweet smelling hair products.,"Two stars because the product is one of few from UFD that does not contain glycerin. The smell is very strong!!! It does what it is supposed to do as a refresher, I guess."
145,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Smells soo good.  I spray it on my daughters bed and blankets too,The scent is so good.  Does the shampoo and conditioner smell this good ? My daughters hair is clean. But smells funky.  Just hope Shampoo smells like this

147,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job but doesn‚Äôt last,This spray does work on locked hair. It does freshen it but doesn‚Äôt last very long. I sprayed it on my hair before bed woke up and you could still smell the scent but by mid day it was gone. Overall nice scent freshens hair but if the scent lasted longer I would have given it 5 stars.
148,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Bubble gum fresh scent,I like this product but will try other hair deodorizers still. It's scent gives me 90s bubble gum fresh feeling. I understand how some people aren't happy where they feel it's slightly feminine smell and not very mature/professional. I like traveling with this and wearing my dirty hair for a full week without offending others with my stinky scalp. I'm not a dry shampoo person. I will purchase again if I don't find a better smelling alternative.
149,"Defunk Hair Odor Neutralizing Tonic, 8 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality product,"I like the scent.  It is not too strong and the smell dissipates fast.  I no longer smell my hair sweat after exercise,  which is very important to me.  I wash my locs once a week and will reorder this product."
