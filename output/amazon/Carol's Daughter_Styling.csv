0,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok.... the smell and thickness are 🤭,I typically like Carol’s Daughter’s oils. My go to used to be the Sacred Tiara until it was discontinued. This is just ok. It has great ingredients but it smells like dirt. And the smell lingers. It’s thicker so it does make my hair oily. Don’t think I will get this again.
1,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My hair loves this!!,"Since this product is unscented it will sort of amplify whatever you already have on your hair; This has such a gentle sweet smell to me, I almost can't describe it. My hair absolutely loves this product! Very moisturizing, nice viscosity to work with, and easy to get down to the roots! My hair has grown half an inch in just a month, which is amazing to me. You won't regret it!"
2,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible horrible smell,"I liked the rest of the ingredients in this, so I took a risk and bought a bottle. Tried it at home and immediately started gagging from the strong smell. It's a very strong peppery-fruit fragrance and it does not go away. I disliked it so much that I had to shower after trying to wait two hours for the scent to dissipate. I would advise using another hair oil since the fragrance is too strong in this one."
3,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to get past the scent,"If you can handle the scent, it works at keeping most of my frizzies away. It is very overpowering to me.  I first tried it on my scalp, and it was just too greasy at the roots with dryness in the ends. I have a lot of hair, but I just use a tiny bit in the palm of my hand (maybe a little more than a pea-size amount) and work it through starting with my ends and blending, blending, scrunching. It works best for me if I wash my hair later in the day, and when it's still a little damp, put on the product and wrap it in a loose bun all night. This photo is first thing in the morning after I let my hair down from the bun."
4,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware,"I waz hoping this would work like the other products but unfortunately my scalped started to feel very dry and i was having patches of dryness. After three days my scalped felt like it burn sometimes. I havent put it on since and its been about 2 days, my scalped still feels like it burns in some areas. The dry patches are still there but i suspect they are chemical burns. This might not happen to everyone, recommend trying a small area for a couple of days to make sure its okay to use."
5,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle came open,Haven’t tried product yet. product arrived with top untwisted and no seal inside of it. It got oil on all other items in the box ! Very disappointed!
6,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than argon oil,"I have very thin hair strands and a ton of it. No matter the humidity in the air, it is frizzy and poofy.  I have been using argon oil for the last few years and it worked fine. This product, however, seems to work much better and more so the day after washing my hair. On wash day, I use a little more than the diameter of a pencil eraser (chin length hair), rub my hands together working my fingers around scrunching/smoothing where needed and I let my hair air dry. The next day and a day after, just a tiny bit is needed to tame the frizzies and soften the waves. This oil seems lighter than the argon oil hence any slight overage didn't cause major strand clumping.  The scent is nice and isn't overwhelming, at least with the amount I use."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The smell is not pleasant,"Decided to throw this item away; the smell/scent is not what I want on my hair. So I did not use it based on the odor/scent. It was difficult trying to wash the smell/scent off my fingers.  I would not recommend this product based on the item description. I am sure that all of its ingredients truly benefit the hair, Also, I could not determine what hair texture or hair type this products is beneficial for.  No hair product should leave a lingering smell that is unpleasant to smell."
8,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this stuff,"I moved to the desert from the east coast and my hair dried up and broke off because I didn’t actually take care of it before! I had long frizzy, 3a/3b hair and for the longest I didn’t use anything other than conditioner and gel! I’ve tried a lot of different things, but this smell combined with the way the products feel on my hair and scalp are amazing. My curls feel light, bounce and SHOCKINGLY stopped breaking off and splitting my ends. The moisture loss problem has also stopped, so after I had to do a big chop because of my damage, this stuff and scalp massages have my hair growing like sea weed.This stuff smells like the body oil OSEA so if you don’t like lemon mixed with seaweed, sunshine and sea salt smell, just take a hard no on this… you will smell like summer and I guess that bothers some people!Love love love this stuff."
9,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing products that actually work for crazy frizzy curly hair.,"I usually read a million reviews before I try a new product but I didnt have time so I just bought this and let me say I absolutely love it for my hair and my daughters (who is biracial and has crazy curly hair) I've spend thousands on hair care for her and 90% of it doesn't work or just looks gross in her hair but this is the one, and after 2 weeks if use I decided to go on and see what else the brand has to offer and all of it so far is the best thing I've found for her hair. Buy it all uou won't be dissatisfied."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Hair fell out,"So excited to get this product because of the reviews, used it as soon as it came. A few hours later felt the back of my head and a patch of my hair had fallen out. The product did not have a protective plastic seal. So not sure if it is the actual product as produced by Carol's Daughter or if the oil had been replaced."
11,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Makes hair oily and doesn’t smell great,"I have natural thin crazy curly frizzy hair. I was hoping this would help control my frizz (atleast a little) and not make my hair look oily. It so hard to find a good product. I was hopeful for this to work for me but it wasn’t what I hoped for. It smells horrible, doesn’t help at all with my frizz and it makes my hair super oily. I know when you use oil you use just a small amount but any amount of this just makes my hair smelly and oily. I wish this would of worked."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a loooong way,"It does help with scalp itchiness with my braids but it has an overwhelming patchouli-like scent. After I applied this to my scalp, all of my hair was oily within 10 minutes. I have very long, bleached and color treated straight hair. Even after I shampooed, my hair had an oiliness to it. This is probably best for very coarse and dry hair."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dry hair,"I had been searching a LONG time for a moisturizing oil to use after I wash my hair. My hair is extremely dense, 3b-4a. It gets dry easily as I’m pregnant now and my hair is just way drier than it’s ever been before. I normally do braid outs. I use this oil on my scalp after I finish my braids and every other day as needed while my braids are in. It keeps my hair moisturized and shiny and healthy. It also smells really good. I’m happy with it and I’m going to continue purchasing this oil."
14,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Smells awful,"I was so incredibly excited to try this. Especially after I had just discovered the Mimosa pomade which smells like heaven. What I was looking for was an oil for my dry scalp that wouldnt make my hair look greasy but was moisturizing. So far it appears to be helping with the moisture issue which is awesome. But the smell of it...its strong and it lingers. It is very peppery, like peppery dirt is how I'd describe it. Its got to be the cumin in it which I'd hoped wouldn't be noticeable but it overpowers the other products in my hair and for the rest of the day all I can smell is that peppery dirt smell. I even put some drops of peppermint oil into it (which honestly that stuff is so strong it could overpower most smells) and it didn't help at all. Unfortunately I'm gonna have to look for a new oil even if this one does what I was looking for."
15,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Chemical Burns on hairline and scalp.,"I wanted to like this product, in fact I bought a secind bottle after finishing the first until I realized it was the reason for my scalp and edges developing red splotches like from a chemical burn (I know bc I used to relax my hair and have suffered chemical burns before). After halting use in my other creams and oils this was the last thing, and after I stopped use the red patches went away around my hairline. It definetly has a strong spice smell to it (the ginger) and it is possible for vertain herbs and spixes ro burn your skin, My scalp was just too sensitive for it I suppose. It did moisturize my scalp and hair, but the burns wrapped it up for me. Onto the next I suppose. I wouldnt use it on a child or for someone with sensitive skin."
16,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for locs,This oil was the best thing to happen to my locs but then comes thieves/maintenance repairs and now I have to order more. I guess my Carol's Daughter hair milk styling foam will have to do for my retwist. Oh no it's running low lol but I have enough for this Saturday night. ; )
17,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight moisturizing oil, reduces shedding","I have fine, dense, Type 4a-4c hair.... and my hair LOVES it. I actually like the scent, and It's moisturizing but not a heavy oil. And the best part?! My shedding has reduced significantly."
18,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,I cannot tolerate the smell,"I don't understand how some are describing the smell as perfume and pleasant. It stinks! I hate it. It has a strong ""dirt"" or cigar smell that never goes away until I rewash my hair. I will never buy any of the goddess products again. The shampoo and conditioner also smells like this. A waste of my money. In the trash all 3 will go."
19,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the scent for me,"I like the ease at which the oil comes from the bottle but the scent....I really don’t like the scent. I should have thought of that since it has cumin seeds in it and I don’t like the smell of cumin, but I was focused on a getting a good oil. I will say, I don’t smell it today after using it on my daughter yesterday."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too strong a sweet perfume-y scent that is difficult to get over!,"I have used this only once so far. The bottle is small. The oil consistency seems ok. I am hoping it will deliver results. Too early to tell. I am not finicky about scents but man, this is just way too strong and sweet and perfume-y even for me and I can't seem to get over that. I might look to dilute it with other oils like sweet almond oil just so the scent becomes bearable. I had heard about the brand but now I will be careful buying anything from this brand. If you are someone who is sensitive to scents, stay away from this oil. I don't think I will order this again."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,GOTS TO BE THE BEST,"I have severe dry skin, scalp issues .. and Lord knows what else. I love the feel, the smells .. and OMG.. I SWEAR... my skin and scalp feels soooooo much better. !!!!Honest.. I truly am going to buy from this shop from now on!"
22,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great feeling,"This oil works very well and absorbs into my scalp very well. I don't like oils that sit of top. I have locs, so I am very careful not to use certain products that may make my hair flake. I don't have to apply this very often, which is another positive."
23,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the smell,Definitely not a light oil. Will weigh down your hair immediately. I haven't used on the scalp yet. Had surgery on my head about 6 months back and it traumatized my scalp causing extreme hairless. I bought the oil for the ends and to eventually run on my scalp to stimulate regrowth. It is greasy but it is oil.
24,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this hair/scalp oil!!!,"This stuff is just what I was looking for! I've tried all the others, and none come even close to this product. I love the smell and texture of this oil, worked into my hair and scalp and felt instant relief from dry hair and itchy dry scalp, also tamed my curls just right!!! Very light and pleasant, not heavy, not greasy! I love it!!! Thank you"
25,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good oil for moisture,I didn't care for the 7 oil blend oil at all. It didn't seem to really moisturize my hair much at all. The scent is okay. It smells like a pencil. I wouldnt buy this product again. Its definitely pretty pricey for a item that didn't seem to be great at all.
26,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Works on thin curly hair,I have been using this product for a few days now and it has left my hair soft and manageable every time!! I love the scent too! I’ve already recommended it to every curly girl I know.
27,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,"I use this product on my locs when retwisting and it did wonders for my scalp and hair. I initially hated the sweet smell but I realized that after the sweet smell subsidied, I could smell hints of castor oil which I like. My scalp itches alot and this helps with the itching. It's a good product. Money well spent!!"
28,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Scent too strong, hard to wash out, broke skin out","I found the fragrance offensive, too strong and fake. It feels light and easy to apply, however it broke the skin out around my hairline and does not wash out easily leaving my hair limp. Not great for fine hair or anybody acne prone."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,"This is my 2nd time ordering this oil. I started my Loc journey almost a year ago & wanted to try an oil by a familiar brand. It smells great, last for a long time (use 2 - 3 times a week). Does not weigh my hair down.  Great product if you have locs."
30,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Scent,"The scent is AMAZING , it's light and easy to pour out. I was pleasantly surprised because my scalp is sensitive to castor oil but with this being blended with 7 other oils I haven't had a reaction , all ingredients are labeled and I will be buying this again."
31,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Meh...made my hair greasy after drying,"Made my hair greasy. I usually oil my hair after my shower, let it soak, then brush and all other oils work with my thick long hair. This stuff stuck around and made my hair look greasy after air drying (like I always do)Smells great though!"
32,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing ever,I love this I mixed it with about 46 drops of peppermint oil and use it on my scalp for about a half an hour before I wash my hair. I’ve never had such thick long hair in my life thanks so much for your amazing products carols daughter!
33,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing,I love this product. It makes my locs soft and give them sheen. It smell really good too. I also use it to moisturize my hands. This product does exactly what it's supposed to do. I will definitely order again.
34,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,It didn't work for me.,"It said the it was a leave in conditioner. I put it on, and my hair got greaser and and greaser. By the next day it was like I had poured oil over my head. It isn't something I would use again or recommend to anyone."
35,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product moisturizes temporarily....afterwards it left my scalp feeling extremely itchy.  I would not recommend this product.......
36,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing 10/10,I took a chance on this hair oil after reading how great the reviews were and I was wowed. I usually have to use a ton of hair oil for my thick curls but a little really does go a long way. Impressive clean ingredients. Smells really good too. 10/10
37,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice oil!,"Love this oil! So far, it's working great! Its easy to put on my scalp too which is awesome. I have braids in so having that easy top is cool. However, it does leak if left open! So close it everytime! My scalp is not oily or greasy. Just feels moisturizing."
38,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Root Food,This is my secret finishing after braids are done.  Doesn't mess up parting and soaks in hair good 👌
39,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my hair,"This is the first time I have purchased Carol's Daughter products. I am very pleased. The oil moisturizes my hair, makes my curls look shiny and has even grown my hair. My mother use to say that my 'head eats oil'. Not this product. I will continue to use this oil due to the great results."
40,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for fragile gray hair.,"Oil is lightweight, has a pleasant odor and doesn’t discolor my gray hair."
41,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Works but smelly.,My hair was pretty dry with the sun. Left this on for a day but had to wash out. The smell is very strong. Feels like someone blew smok right into my hair. That being said it did leave my hair hydrated and better than before. And it’s just oils so I think I will add lavender or something to it that smells better.
42,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Superior blend of all the right oils!,"I bought this product for my son and me, because we are both new to Locs and needed a nourishing oil for our crowns.  Carol’s Daughter has a superb mix of healthy, organic ingredients.  It is all at once easy to apply to our scalps, moisturizing (not sticky or waxy), and smells wonderful.  Now the whole family uses it!  It also feels great supporting a small business that started right here in BK, as well!"
43,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,A little goes a long way.,I love how this oil keeps my hair moisturized for a few days.

What a waste. There is not option to request a new one, just drive to return it. Just going to count it as a loss. I buy hair oils all the time and this has never happened in any other order."
45,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Buenas atenciones,"Me gusta la prestación y fragancia, aún no lo he usado pero estoy positiva que será bien, además me gustó la forma no está tan mal, más o menos así tendrían que hacer los demás que nos traen los paquetes a si se perderían menos paquetes, pero una sugerencia, si logran entrar al edifico ya es un paso entregarlo en el apartamento"

If you are sensitive to smells please reconsider. It smells really good but it’s one of those that triggers a headache for me.I passed it to my daughter who is loves it .Please keep in mind I am sensitive to smells, I will try another one of the oils and post an update later"

48,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money!,"This leaves my hair very oily and greasy, even if I don’t use that much.

I don’t think this is made for my hair type though..the only reason for the few stars is it states no weigh down but it looked like I dumped a cup of grease in my freshly washed hair :( my hair smelt so good and was softer but definitely not for use when going out..
51,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Magic,"I have scalp eczema and it gets really bad during the winter. This has brought my scalp back to life and helps provide moisture even when I have a weave in. Usually weaves would leach moisture from my scalp or it was difficult for it to penetrate deep enough. Though it makes my weave a bit oily, it works wonders for my dry 4C hair and scalp."
52,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,"This product was extremely drying, I don’t know if it’s because of the mixture of oils that didn’t work together but my hair was dryer and my scalp got a break out. This product contains soy which is not healthy for your scalp at all."

54,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy!,"I followed the instructions and barely put any of this in my hair. I rubbed it in when my hair was wet and after it dried it was awful. My entire head looked greasy, like I hadn’t showered in weeks. I had to shower to get this crap out of my hair. What a waste of money. I will never be using it again."

56,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product.,"I really like this product. I bought it for my young son’s hair. It has a nice, light scent. It does a great job moisturizing as the oil in his LOC routine. The bottle is easy to open and the oil doesn’t come out too quickly (which is wonderful while trying to keep him from dumping it). 5/5 would recommend."
57,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Ugh,Smells good.

243,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My fair is straight, fine, and especially tends to fly away during the cold dry winter months.  I color my hair but I don't perm it.  I'm also getting older (late 50s) and hair doesn't get any better with age.  I chose this because it's for weak, breakage-prone hair although it's applied to the scalp and then massaged into the scalp and hair.  I like the results of using this although I'm still learning how much to apply.  I started with just a few drops on my scalp and then a few drops more.  It seemed to take a while to get it properly distributed through my hair and I'm not sure it ever reached the ends which are just below my shoulders.  I may have to modify how I apply it to include the ends.  Still, this has nicely tamed my flyaways and unruly hairs so my hair looks much better.  I like the wholesome ingredients which include sunflower seed oil, olive fruit oil, jojoba seed oil, coconut oil, black cumin seed oil, castor seed oil, flax linseed oil, soybean oil, and the other ingredients to keep this stable.  The oil does have a bit of a yellow cast to it but with the small amount needed, there's no impact to that.  I rate this at 4 stars because of the oil's wholesomeness and it works. It's just a bit of 'trial and error' to figure out how to properly get this distributed through my hair for the correct effect without excessive oiliness around the roots."
244,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally reversed my post partum shedding!,"Add this to a quality cold pressed castor oil, and it will change your life in just a few weeks. Better than any prescription product. Life changing for my post partum shedding. My hair was falling out in CLUMPS 3 months after giving birth. I started putting a few drops of both castor oil and the goddess oil on each temple where the hair was receding (I keep them separate, don’t mix together in same bottle).  About 17 days later, and tons of baby hairs are regrowing. That bald spot is almost completely filled in. I also put just the goddess oil all over my scalp (has an applicator tip) at the same time and I do this process about every 2 days. The goddess oil is super light and will be absorbed by morning. It won’t be visible but you’ll still need a shower. It smells AMAZING. Very, VERY happy with the success! Thank you Carol’s Daughter."
245,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"This oil is great to moisturize natural hair and your scalp. My husband stopped using relaxers about a year ago and just did a big chip, taking off about 4 to 5 inches of the old relaxed hair. It has been a lot of trial and error to find products to keep his hair moisturized and feeling good since stopping the relaxers and going natural. He has very thick, very dense 4c hair that is very dry. This oil helps a ton. The scent isnt bad. More of a light, natural scent. Doesnt take too much work to wash it out, but does protect against drying it out too much when washing."

Luckily it was a cold day and I could wear a stocking hat as I didn’t have time to rewash my hair.In the future I will use this as a treatment before shampooing.

My hair is thick and wavy, going past my shoulders, but it is not the coarse texture you might find in natural hair. So please keep this in mind when reading my review.As stated above, I have past the shoulder length thick hair which has been professionally relaxed, professionally colored. It can dry out quite easily, so adding oil is essential to keep the ends from breaking. I've tried many a hair oil, from rose serum to argan to moroccan, so when I saw this, I figured I would give it a go.The instructions say to apply to the scalp; I've had experience in the past with applying oil to the scalp and feeling greasy until my next shower, so this time, I was VERY conservative with how much applied. I barely squeezed the tube and only put some in three areas: part, left and right side of my head. Then I really got in there and massaged it into my scalp.The smell is quite pungent and not exactly pleasant. I've tried Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Leave in Conditioner, and while I liked the results of the product, I struggle to use the product up because of the smell. This oil leaves me with the same feeling - I absolutely have to apply a scent to cover up this oil.I've used this nearly a week now (I know, I know, you need like a month to see if there are results), but I can't say I see much improvement. Is that because I didn't need the improvement or because it's not working for me? You be the judge.Obviously, I'm going to keep trying this out, but I doubt I would continue buying this. I have a good slew of products already at my disposal; however, maybe this will work for you, especially if you have a coarse hair texture."

It makes it easy to apply directly to my scalp, or I can put a little on my fingertips and rub onto my scalp. If too much is applied, then it will make your hair very oily. The scent is not overbearing it actually is pleasant and light smelling. Great for dry scalp. Recommended."
249,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This oil is designed to be used after shampooing and conditioning. My fine hair has become dry and prone to breaking due to overprocessing. I have reversed the process since it makes my roots oily and it has an odd spicy aroma, more like a salad dresding or spice rub than a hair care product. I massage it into my scalp at night, put on a shower cap and go to bed. The next morning I shampoo and condition. Hair looks healthier and shiny and feels gookd. My scalp has definitely shown improvement. It was dry and itchy and is much less so."

My hair smells amazing and i have less breakage after washing. My hair is strong, shiny and healthy. it even seems longer but i’m sure that’s all in my head. trust me try this and you won’t be disappointed."
251,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,I actually take black seed oil daily for the benefits that it helps me with. It’s considered the “cure all but death” supplement.It will probably be the worst tasting thing you take on purpose but it’s amazing.This hair oil actually has it in it and you can definitely smell it in the product. Keep that in mind when you’re applying it to your scalp.I did get some relief when I applied it on my scalp especially with the ever so changing temperatures and weather that we’ve been having here in Florida.You will want to spritz your hair afterwards to mask the smell of this hair scalp oil.
252,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"WHOA, this stuff smells STRONG!  It actually smells pretty good. It kinda smells like candy, like sort of like a fruit snack or licorice, a little spicy scented, yet sweet. But the fragrance is simply too powerful! I only put a few tiny drops on top of my head to test it, and I kept smelling it everywhere I went for the rest of the day. I think if you used an efficient amount of this, that it might knock some people down if you got too close. I might suggest that you dilute this in your own carrier oils!!!Another thing that I don't feel comfortable with, is that this is not advertised as containing hexane free castor oil and as someone who has many years of knowledge and experience with natural health and skin care, it is my understanding that it is very important to use only hexane free castor oil!"
253,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for dryness,"We have an elderly aunt who lives with us. She can't do a lot of things for herself, including hair care. She doesn't like to shampoo very often, and you'd think that would lead to oiliness, but it's just the opposite for her -- her hair and skin gets dry and brittle. So we massage this scalp/hair oil into her skin and hair in the morning a few times a week. She has issues with itchy scalp and dry hair and this helps her. She doesn't scratch as much and her hair looks more natural. The price is good for what you get.The oil does have a natural, kind-of-nutty fragrance, which isn't a scent you'd normally associate with hair products, at least in the USA. It's not a bad smell, though, and doesn't really linger long, but I figure I'd better mention it."
254,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic for curly hair!,"Oh, the texture of curly hair! It is a problem a lot of times to just keep it looking somewhat healthy. I do not have curly hair, but my daughter has type 3a. It has been a big learning curve to take care of her hair and keep it curly instead of frizzy. Hair oil is critical. This one is a little heavy for every day use for type 3a, but it is awesome when we do what we call oil braids. We put her hair oil in, braid her hair, and leave it for a day or two. Then we wash, condition, and voila...looks amazing! We usually do this once per week, and he hair looks amazing. We just used this one for the first time, and we love it. It smells wonderful, too. The bottle is HUGE and will last for a really long time. I am thrilled. Great hair oil!"

Adds a nice shine to your hair and leaves it , at least for me, extra soft.  The scent is pleasant and fades rather quickly so you don’t smell it all day long.  You can warm this up a bit before putting in your hair and it feels lovely..  I had no scalp / skin irritations, rashes, etc. when using."

It’s very effective, but when the jar ran out, I looked to see if the company made anything else for dry mature hair like mine.  This scalp oil is wonderful, and just like the mimosa pomade, only a tiny bit is needed to add shine, texture and moisture.  I like that it can be applied to dry or wet hair—both ways make my hair feel and look good again.  It takes some practice finding how much is right for your hair though—too much will make hair look greasy.  Just the right amount makes hair look healthy and more vibrant.  The added bonus with both products is the wonderful fragrance."

I couldn’t figure out why my hair was thinning, I tried everything to figure out. I’ve been using carols daughter products for over a year. I decided to switch my hair products to see if that fixed my hair thinning problems, after using a different brand of shampoo my hair began growing and I experienced way less fall out. I believe it was Carols daughter products making my hair thin very quickly. Please do not buy!"

I didn't care too much for the light scent of the oil, and this is just me, but I didn't enjoy slathering the oil onto my hair and scalp. It was an extra step beyond shampoo and conditioning that I just don't have much time for, although it did a great job of making my hair feel healthier though.  If your hair requires extra treatment, this would work well for you."
259,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t use too much because the oil will def run down your neck... it did make my skin feel soft...The smell is sweet and kind of peppery... it reminds me of the cuticle oil they use at the nail salon.I felt like I had to use a lot of it to even feel like it was moisturizing my scalp... so I wouldn’t use this to “grease your scalp”.I’d rather just oil the castor oil... it’s thicker and coats my scalp better.This oil isn’t that thick... but the tip helped me navigate through my twists to get to my scalp... so that’s a plus.

Conditioners leave my hair matted so I avoid them.  This scalp oil is meant to be used after shampoo as a leave in treatment.  I knew that wouldn't work for me but I got the oil to use it overnight.  It smells great and is silky to the touch.  I leave it in overnight, shampoo, rinse and I'm good.  My hair isn't matted instead it is moisturized and shiny.  I'm going to need more than the one bottle!"

This bottle is basically hair oil with a light pleasant smell. It is however very greasy the first time I used a tiny amount on her hair and it ended up a greasy oily mess. The best way to use it is to put it in like a hair mask for ten minutes then wash it out using regular shampoo. When I did this my daughters lovely curls came back!

I believe it's making my hair stronger and moisturises my scalp, but I can't say that I love it."
264,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,smells awful,Deep regret at purchasing this.  This smells like a tobacco barn.  Like a tobacco pipe or chewing tobacco.  All I can think is this must have been scented by people who are too young to remember smoking and non smoking sections and how awful restaurants and planes used to smell.  Or by smokers.  My hair smells like a spittoon and even using a highly scented shampoo hasn't gotten rid of it.

She showers, washes her hair, dries it, and then when her hair is fully dry, my wife puts in the scalp oil blend.

If you're looking for a scalp oil blend for dry scalps, I can give 7 Oil Blend Scalp Oil a strong recommendation."

My hair, which is naturally very long and thick, had started to get very dry. And no matter how much leave-in conditioner I used, the dryness wouldn't go away, and the breakage continued. Then I discovered this product and decided to give it a try.My hair has never been so well moisturized! This oil leaves my hair shiny and silky smooth to the touch without being greasy/oily. Lots of people complain about the smell, and I too, found the smell of this oil to be a little too strong when I first started using it. But I've grown used to the scent now, and hardly notice it anymore. Plus, the scene lightens up after use; it doesn't linger in your hair forever.Highly recommended."
279,"Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend Scalp & Hair Oil with Castor Oil and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, 4.2 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This oil is perfect with the proper regimen.,"Having 4C hair is usually a struggle when it comes to finding the right products, especially when you have low porosity hair. I normally make my own oil but I haven't had the time lately. Store bought oils are usually either really heavy and my hair won't process them, it will be greasy and brittle at the same time. The other oils are too thin and watery, this one worked perfectly for me. I combine it with the Coco Creme Coil enhancer, and it leaves my hair feeling soft, smelling really nice, and very easy to manage."

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"
1,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"I have thick, wavy, coarse, frizzy hair and this product didnt do anything for me. It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I have bouncy curls now!,"I never thought I could just let my curls air dry and be done, but with this hair mask that is very much possible! I’m so happy with my purchase! I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"
5,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,ZERO STARS - WORST. SMELL. EVER. And no way to get it out of hair.,I shampooed my hair six times with anothe product and cannot get this horrific smell out of my hair. God help me.
6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."
7,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Day 1 styling,"Love the hold, definition, and shine it adds to my hair on day 1. If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."
8,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!,"This is now my favorite product. It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."
9,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,New favorite hair mask (type 3c/4a/4b hair),"The hair mask is AMAZING... im not a fan of the smell and it does linger in your hair (reminds me of the Aveeno lavender baby lotion) ... BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,This actually works !,"So I have the worst dry hair. Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

This stuff lasts for days on end, doesn’t leave hair crunchy or frizzy - cost effective and a little bit goes an incredibly long way. I have spiral curls and this goes on great. I’ve bought it for friends with wavy hair and will use it for the rest of my life. Cannot believe i finally found a product that does it all. Get this. You’re welcome."
12,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hold but SUPER flaky,"It has a good hold, but…. You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."
13,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but didn’t deliver,"I am trying to find something less expensive than Kinky Curls custard. Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."
14,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product.,I have issues with odors ; My friends know not to come around me with smelly ( perfumes soaps deodorant etc.)  this has a nice clean smell and does not linger.
15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.
16,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Says for curly hair but for my thick course frizzy hair,"This product was recommended as I live in Florida and the humidity really makes my hair frizz. I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."
17,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells amazing, great hold and shine","This stuff is great! I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"
18,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols Daughter Coco Creme EXCELLENT Product!,I love Carols Daughter products and was happy to see the launch of the Coco Creme line.  I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.
19,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but may take a bit of time","I did not like this shampoo at first, and wouldn't have used it again if I had another option, but at the time I did not. I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."
20,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will never ever put this near my hair again.,"I have natural hair. I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.
22,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best find for my kinky curls, after 40 years of searching!","I had stopped buying products since nothing seemed to work for my kinky, white-girl curls. I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"
23,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,The only Carol's Daughter Product I use,"I've purchased Carol's Daughter products in the past and many of them were average, for me.  Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."
24,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Wear Dark Colors,"The price for the amount of gel received was pretty good.  The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."
25,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous,Been using this product for years Never leave home without it!
26,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Left My Hair Dry & brittle,"After first applying Carol's Daughter Coco Creme to my damp hair I could feel my hair turning hard.  I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."

I apply this to my hair every time I wash it, which is usually 2-3 times a week. I leave it on for at least 5 minutes to really moisturize my hair. I love the smell and it makes my hair soft, silky and shiny."

I've been looking for something like this for so long and I finally found it. This leave in conditioner is perfect for my curls, it softens and moisturizes my hair and the smell  OMG just divine!!! I'm proudly going to say that this is my new creme and I will be trying more of their other products for sure."
29,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Waxy, not moisturizing","I purchased this in hopes of using a little less Heat and Humidity gel during the winter months and as a more moisturizing product than the leave-in I usually use. The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."
30,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells like old spice, but my hair feels great!","I’ve used the original hair milk in the past and really liked it, so I decided to try the coco creme hair mask.This does not smell like coco or cream or any combination of the two. The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."
31,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rinse Out Type of Hair Mask,"Some of these reviews people been talking about how it doesn't make their hair curl talking like they think it's a leave in conditioner cream. This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

So glad I found a replacement product. Winner

Super dry hair problem solved in first use.,"Since my hair started going gray it has become unmanageable and I’ve been struggling to figure out how to care for it. It’s like I have an entirely different head of hair. I’m so glad I found this product! Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness. I highly recommend this to anyone who has super curly hair that’s going gray and are frustrated and thinking WTF?? Overnight, all of my hair troubles are solved. I noted comments about the smell, totally subjective but I love the scent."

When properly moisturized, he has a head full of big gorgeous curls.  Finding the right product for him has been difficult.  So happy to have taken a chance on this mask after reading reviews.

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or this is just a bad batch but it’s horrible."

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips. Then I did the same thing at my roots surrounding my face. But the greatest thing was that I didn't habe ti do or add anything else to get defined curls and waves. This is my new go-to. I also bought the conditioner and I am buying the shampoo next."
40,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Soft and curly.,"I'm still feeling this out but I think I like it.  I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

I am obsessed w the Black Vanilla shampoo & conditioner,  so I decided to try this one and it was like the total opposite.My hair turned out feeling like hay, wouldnt style easily, nor detangle well. Also my scalp was left feeling so dry and itchy I had to run serum through my strands and it was STILL dry...And frizzy and dull!I recommend the Black Vanilla moisture products."

46,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,The scent is too strong,"I use the shampoo and the conditioner and two other products of Carol’s Daughter and I really like them. This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming. The intensity of the chemical smell plus coconut  did reduced overnight but not enough. To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

Hair is soft when using this. I’ve used this a month now in addition to other products because I don’t like my hair poofy. 1 jar does last me a month with every day use, a little goes a long way with this product. 4 stars because of the price and I can’t give 4.5."

My hair went from mostly moisturized to frizzy, DRY (it actually began to crackle and break), my curl pattern became kinky instead of spirals. This isn't for dry hair. This isn't for anybody's hair, really."

I have 4c low porosity hair, and I used the Cantu leave-in before this one and it worked well for me but I wanted to find a moisturizer that is black-owned and works just as well. Guess I'll keep looking cuz this one ain't it."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.  I will also be trying the Coco Crème shampoo and conditioner."

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.  My style lasted for a good 2 weeks without all the stringiness you start to see as the coils soften.  I have purchased more of Carol's Daughter products as a result."

I can even use it without a conditioner(I try not to!), and it still tames everything down.For me it's worth it, and I hope they never stop making it.  I don't want to keep adding to my reject pile of shampoo bottles if they did!"

Smells amazing, super easy to distribute evenly through hair and really nice hold but still feels soft to the touch. Unfortunately the package I received this time was severely damaged and there was no gel in the container because it spilled all over the box. Box was wrapped in plastic but soaked in gel. Will update my review when new product arrives."

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

58,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I’ve found for dry thin ringlets,"I’ve tried so many curl products for my daughters soft, thin and very dry ringlets. Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

After purchasing and wasting money on products that claim to work on “very dry” hair,  I brought carol’s daughter thinking it would solve my problem.  This product breaks my hair.  It contains mineral oil.  And it’s a cream not a paste.  My hair has to be wet."
62,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Why the sent though?!?!,This would be my go to shampoo/conditioner if it did have the worst lingering smell i have ever encountered. Its very moisturizing my looked amazing after i used it. But Oh. My. Gosh. The smell is infuriating it gave me horrible headaches and lasted for days. I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

I washed my hair earlier and only added this product.. Later that evening after hair dried it looked white, so I used a brush on my hair and this is what happened. So very very disappointed.

While most gels leave your hair crunchy, heavy, and frizzy, this product left my hair light-weight, soft, and the best it has ever looked. Had this product for a while and still only used half the container. Definitely would buy again."

It isn't overpowering once you wash it all off but when you have it on it feels excessive. I use it about once a week or every two weeks and I really don't find much of a difference in my hair, it gives *some* moisturization but I prefer other masks I've tried."

The consistency of this product was not what I expected. it was very close to a dippity do, too gelly for me and didn't help my curls. It was nice for making my hair kind of silky."

It's soft- it makes my hair Softer and it's super Moisturizering. For anyone like me who doesn't know what to use on your hair, go to a natural hair salon and get a hair consultation. They're usual free. It's okay to ask a professional. And there is a difference between this - a pudding- the hair Milk (also a great product) a cream."

It works great as a hair mask and leave in conditioner because it deeply hydrates and defines my hair but it irritates my scalp a little and makes it itch. I still enjoy this product though and I would recommend it to everyone with natural hair.

The top has been wiped down like it was once sticky. Not sure if it’s safe to use or if it was tampered with. I read the reviews that it doesn’t come with an additional seal, but it would have been helpful in this instance to know if it was tampers with."

My kid had 4c hair and the average moisturizers don't work for his hair type. This worked like a charm. His hair was soft, moisturized, and it smelled so good. Another plus was the shipping time."

I smell like I just stepped out of the beauty salon and not necessarily in a good way. I can literally taste the cloud of fragrance hanging around my hair. It's too much & that really sucks cuz my curls do look better.Update: after day 4 I had to throw the rest away. The fragrance made me so nauseous I almost ralphed after my shower. Never again."

I've purchased several of this product line. It smells wonderful, feels great on my hair and great for styling.

I cannot use products that contain a lot of oil.  It will just sit on my hair and take away  any natural wave or curl.  My hair responds to products that have more water.  This product works well with my hair texture.  I just wet my hair, massage into the scalp and ends and style."

She has coppery corkscrew curls... with the right product.This product is the only product in 13 years that ‘consistently’ detangles her curls and keeps them bouncy. We’ve tried everything from kerastase to Unite to Mixed Chics. Most work for a little while but eventually weigh her curls down, leave her frizzy or just crunchy. Every once in a while we throw in different products but thus cleansing conditioner is the easiest and best for us."

It cleans my scalp Without stripping my hair and it smells amazing. A surprisingly small amount spreads all over my hair and has good slip with a silky lather.

Yikes!,"I'm sure the conditioner is awesome, but I didn't get a chance to use it. After lifting up the seal I noticed something black in the conditioner.

620,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,I lost my hair,"I just walked out of the shower crying today. I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."
621,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have curly/wavy hair you know that one person's holy grail item isn't always going to work for everyone. I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."
622,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I wanted to really love this product.And, honestly, after all I went through to salvage enough to use, I *deserved* to love it! When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss.

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."

But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered. It came completely broken and spilled pretty much all of the product in the mailing pack it came in. I guess USPS just kinda through the package around before it got to me because the cover was all the way cracked. The product was even leaking outside the package itself."

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

645,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

So glad I found this hair product.

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

I really like this company. I love that their products, like this one, has NO silicones, parabens, petroleum, mineral oil or artificial colors.  I find the fragrance of this one to be light and refreshing overall. Not overpowering for a man and I believe lots of women will also enjoy it.  Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.  I honestly have received and reviewed many different shampoo and conditioner products from different companies. Carols daughter is one of my favorite. This is a company I would buy from again."

But as it drys your skin feels awesome. When I googled where to buy, is when I discovered it was for your hair. WHAT A LAUGH I HAD. Sorry but I'm going to use it all over. It's great.

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."
658,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Deeply hydrating,"The summer humidity had left my curls feeling dry and frizzy, and my normal cowash routine seemed to get longer everyday as my regular conditioner no longer had the same slip so I was more than excited to try this conditioner. First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

But I love the product so much that I can put up with the smell. I put a good amount of gel on my wet hair as it is long and curly. It sure is gel...slimy and all. But it works. I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

This stuff has a very strong, sharp artificial scent that, for me, is a total turn off. I'm sensitive to strong fragrances and won't be able to use this at all. So bummed!"

I have super dry, thick, frizzy hair and it works great. I was so glad to finally try their sulfate-free shampoo too. I have been using Deva-Curl NoPoo Shampoo and it works great, but I like to change up my shampoo and not use the same one all the time.

You only really need one squirt for medium length hair. Smells great too! Love it!"

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

Even after just one use you can see and feel the results. My hair looks so healthy and has a shine that it didn’t before. This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

My hair is so naturally dry I don't even rinse the conditioner out; I just gently work the conditioner down to my ends and squeeze out the conditioner with the excess water. This leaves my hair well hydrated. Carol's Daughter conditioner works much the same, but the scent is heavenly. The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo. The pump is handy. I prefer for my conditioner to have a pump so I can measure each time I use it (3 pumps).

The smell of this mask is amazing.  It has a sweet, coconut fragrance that lingers long after rinsing the product out of your hair.  The mask itself is very thick and silky feeling and absorbs quickly into the hair.  Although the instructions say to leave this mask on for 3-5 minutes, I like leaving it a bit longer in order to get the most out of it.  Every time I have used this mask, it has left my hair feeling nourished and smooth.  It also brings a bit of shine back to my hair.  Great product that is made in the USA."

Rhassoul Clay

   shampoo and conditioner for months now, and I really like those.  This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent.

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly.

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours.

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.)

This may be a turnoff for others because it is very strong, but it works for me.  It also doesn't weight down my hair and has enough moisture to get me through the day in my dry climate.  I wish it helped volumize while moisturizing,but I can't have it all."

At the same time, my hair is quite dry and, as I’ve aged, the grays are a little coarse, so I do need to use conditioning products for manageability.I was pleasantly surprised to find that this mask does just what I need. It seems heavy, but it rinses thoroughly and gives my hair just the right boost of conditioning.  I’m really pleased with the results and glad I went ahead and tried this."

After big chopping in '15, I used the black vanilla shampoo conditioner combo and it was a great addition to my hair regime to help it grow back quickly.

Factor in the drying air of winter and my hair looks and feels like straw. Lightly fragranced, this shampoo lathers richly and rinses cleanly.

But when I applied it, the lather was so rich and luxurious that I realized a little goes a very long way.  And the result?  My hair looks and feels nice.  This is something I think I could use every day and not have my hair turn into straw."

First, I needed only a small amount, much less than I usually must use, when I shampooed my very long hair. This shampoo suds up easily and cleans as it moisturizes. After I used it, my hair was ultra-soft and tangle free. This shampoo contains no sulfates, parabens or artificial colors. It does contain coconut oil, milk, murumuru and mango butters, which hydrate and nourish the hair. It has a light and refreshing coconut scent. In addition, this wonderful shampoo comes in any easy-to-use pump bottle for your convenience. It is fairly priced for an excellent, concentrated shampoo.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."

773,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS FOR 4C HAIR,"At first I thought this would be another hair fail. I have 4C hair, and there are so many products that promise to be compatible that aren't, all they do is dry you hair out, and sit on top of it making it gritty and harder to manage. I have low porosity hair, and most products just don't work for me. I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."
774,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for 4c hair!,I purchased this product along with the curl enhancing moisture cream for my daughter who has 4c hair. It did not work for her hair at all see pics(last two) however for my hair it did great! I have 4a/4b hair. It defined my curls perfectly! The moisture was disappointing especially since this product is supposed to be for very dry hair; It was just ok. Overall I will not be purchasing it again for my daughter but MAY buy it for myself. If you have 4c hair save your money!

827,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,Dry after effect on hair,It has a good slip and gave good curl definition .

I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."
829,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Scent isn’t for me and too much,I do like this for my hair. I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter for Very Dry Hair, with Coconut Oil and Mango Butter, Paraben Free and Silicone Free Butter for Curly Hair, 12 oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

When I first applied it, I thought this was absolutely great.  My Natural hair laid beautifully. Finished applying this product  to my edges, got dressed for work, walked out the door 20 minutes after applying the product to my hair, sat in the car, checking in the mirror thinking to my self, ""girl get one more look at your cute self"" and behold edges looked like I had not touched them.  Edges looked like greasy rolled up BBs around my head. ""Peas"" just glistening."

So I really researched edge control that one would't leave any residue on my hair and that still would give me the desired finish. Carol's Daughter makes amazing products and the Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Edge Control is amazing. It has now become my favorite and the scent black vanilla is subtle yet pleasant. I'm happy!"

It smells great and initially gives great hold, but it breaks down quickly in the summer heat and turns into an oily mess. I only advise using this product if you will be inside in the A/C all day.

But I am absolutely in love with the scent. I've always been a sucker for vanilla, but this is the best it's ever smelled. What is it? I think it has coconutty undertones, which another turn on. I see they have many other products, like shampoo and conditioner, with this scent and I wouldn't buy this edge control again, but I'd try other products just for the scent.The scent saves you. I use it just for that. I'd probably mix it with a better working edge control just for that, as well. It's addictive. It does work a little and it makes my hair soft, but there are plenty of flyaway. I was impressed by the size, however. You get what you pay for!"
16,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid--completely useless,"Horrible. This product is greasy and caused mild breakouts on my forehead and temples. It also did nothing to hold down my edges. I had to mix in some eco style gel just to get some hold, but even then, it would start to lift within an hour. It also left a residue so my edges would be lifted, filmy AND stiff. This product rivals ORS for the worst edge control ever. I'm having much better results with TGIN now."

I did a few test runs of putting a silk scarf on and leaving it on for awhile, but about 1-2 hours later (if that) my defined edges were no where to be found. Today alone I’ve reapplied it 3 times. Even if reappying the product is required 3+ times is too much for me.Fortunately I am working from home so I am able to go through these trial and errors, but I can’t allow myself to keep using this and expect it to get better.If it works for you, great; however, it does not work for all and that’s okay - just have to try something else."
18,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice option,"It's my current edge control.  I've purchased it from Amazon several times.  While I'm always interested in trying different edge controls, I  have consistently I've been pleased with this.  It doesn't slick down my edges in a sticky, tight way. But it lays them down nicely and adds to my look. I'm considering adding another type of edge control to lightly apply on top, just to get a longer lasting hold for long days. But this is a great option if you're desirous of having nice edges and keeping them."

21,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,For Braiding,"I plan to use this for braiding, and I can say that it does work for that. However, I noticed that if I took too long or if I touched it too many times, my hair would curl (I'm natural) back up, or form a looser curl that it's original, rather than stay in place. I can't say that it will lay my edges down, because I haven't tried and don't do those types of things to my hair. But I feel that it honestly could if I were to quickly do it and not touch it. Also, like most products like this, you may need to press something firm against your head until it dries."

It’s thick so use a small 2 finger scoop and spread thin. I mix with firm gel or another thick edge control to maximize hold and it’s good even on its own if u have coarse hair. Definitely worth money to me
23,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's not what I expected,"Most of the products of this line smell great, so I may have been expecting the same from this edge control. It smells faintly like the cream of nature edge control. Which isn't bad, just not what I anticipated.Also It's hold is not good at all. I tested a bit of it on my edges and they didn't stay down for more than 5 mins. I have very soft, 2c hair, and usually use edge control just to handle the frizz my baby hairs have and nothing, I could move it with my finger gently touching it. It didn't set or control my hair at all, so I don't expect it'll work for other hair textures that are curlier than mine."

25,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Strong Scent,"I just received this product today and immediately tried to use it. The scent is strong. It’s a nice scent but very loud. I don’t mind lightly scented products but this one is to much for me, I couldn’t take it. Not even sure if this will hold because I never made it that far. Gave 3 stars because you have to pick one (wish I could leave it blank) so I choose 3 bc the feel makes me believe this might hold but I’ll never no for sure"
26,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Edges out of control,"When I put it on my edges in the morning before going to work, my edges look smooth.  I feel good.  Then I get into the car to go to work, I look in the rear view mirror to see my edges curled right back up!  By the end of the day the product is dried up. I have 4c\d hair. It’s dry.I like the smell. It provides a nice protective barrier for head bands or anything that puts stress or rest on your hairline. However, I didn’t get that smooth edge control. I’m yet to find a product that works for me. I may order this again to help protect my hairline, but not for the edge control."

If they’d go back to the original hair milk scent, I’d be thrilled."

It is very thick, like very stiffened jello. But when you rub it between your fingers it softens up. At first you think your hair will look very greasy, but as it is absorbed you will not notice it anymore (of course depending on how much you use) and it really softens up the hair and gives it this nice smell as a bonus. Good product, will buy again when this is finished."

Silky smooth and just really helpful to my braiding of her hair. I really like that it keeps it's luster through out the day so when I go to pick up my daughter from school, outside of normal wear from her running around, it still looks good and we could go somewhere else if we needed to without having to retouch up her hair. I like that aspect."
30,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Typical edge control,I found these to be the same as other brands of edge control. I have fine textured wavy hair and so I only need a little bit. The scent is strong. My husband has thick course wavy/curly hair and it worked well for his braids also. If you have finer hair I wouldn’t use it regularly as it seems to be rough for regular use. For both of our hair types though it stayed thick until washed out even with light application.
31,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great edge moisturizer, not a replacement for gel, but used as a base.","This is a great edge moisturizer, but not so good for an all day hold. What I like to do is use it as a base to smooth my edges and lay them down, then I use a very very small amount of hair gel to keep it in place all day long. Since I’m not using only gel, my edges don’t dry out and break off. Instead, they stay moisturized all day long while that dab of hair gel keeps it locked in."
32,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Buy from a reputable retailer.,"First off, it came half empty, so beware of buying product on Amazon. Smells good, but i don't have high hopes for it's performance. My daughter is mixed and this product feels too thin or watered down for her hair type. I tried it this evening to see if it's worth receiving half empty, and it's definitely not. Im going to return it."
33,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Light hold,This product provides a light hold to hair edges for my fly away strands for 10-12 hours. The product is not sticky nor does it make the hair stiff. The scent of this product is very subtle. The smell is not heavy and people will not be smelling your hair when you enter the room and that I do like about the product. I would not recommend this if you are looking for a heavy hold or your hair is very thick.
34,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,This did not do anything for keeping even 1 small hair down. I have a few short hairs in front but this could not even handle those.

But I can say by far using this brand in general has not flakes up my scalp, now trying the edge control, it has a hold just like any other and it doesn’t give my scalp a run for it’s dryness. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND to someone who is looking for a edge control (with little to none alcohol content) to buy and try. If u don’t want the regular size also try finding samples or even the travel size"

This product smells good and has a waxy texture that lays the hair down pretty well but only for a couple of minutes. By the time I get to the office my edges are curling up and not laid whatsoever. I just got my braids done for the first time so I didn't really know what product would be best and I sprung for this one because it was inexpensive and looked like it used natural ingredients, which is still true, but if you want your edges to stay put, definitely look elsewhere."
38,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good!,"It was only four dollars,  I am so surprised it worked being this cheap because my hair is really kinky around the edges. It slicked my hair down without being white, gummy, or streaky. I hadn't been able to buy my normal Vonte styling gel (which I highly recommend) so I bought this and I am happy with the results. It is initially crunchy for me, but it turns soft about five minutes later."

Black owned company, expected more?!  Dnt make C4 hair edges lay down. Does not hold.  Doesn't stiffen or harden.  Its like thick sweet scented hair grease.

I have locs that are mid back length. I wrap my hair alot and I thought that this product would lay my edges in a way to wear my wrap with big hoop earrings.

However, once you start moving around and it becomes dry, the hair edges start to revert back.  I had to reapply water to my hair several times throughout the day just to make my edges lay down.  I'd rather just use gel."
56,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Edge Control Ever!!!,"This product works very well. It's very gentle on the hair and washes out easily. You do have to use a little more than most of the other brands because it is so gentle. However, it is worth it, it moisturizes and the cost is good. You can easily comb through this one as well. It may occasionally flake, if so, just rub the area with a little water to even it out."

If you add water it gets really slippery. It makes my curly hair straight though. Weighs it down a lot like any other pomade. I have 3c curls. Likely won’t be using it anymore as it destroys my curls. I guess it’s better for straight hair?

(Type 4 Hair and edges),I have type 4 hair and this didn't hold my hair for 1 minute. Edge booster works better for me and holds my edges all day. The scent is like an artificial cinnamon bun filling and is extremely moisturizing so that was the only upside.it would probably work in looser edges or thinner less oily edges.

70,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,LESS than Average,"The formula is Very hard in container, doesn’t build on brush well or apply easily on edges. It takes some time to style edges bc of density in formula, especially if you are trying to lay/style them. It doesn’t hold as well as my other edge gels, I think it lasted well for a couple hours, which was disappointing. The product also leaves a film/white residue after there is any movement in the edges, which bc it didn’t last long, was a bummer. The only reason why I am giving this product 2 stars is bc the price is not bad (although it didn’t work well) and bc it did hold for a couple hours."

606,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not for super kinky hair,Really loved it for me and one if my daughter's.

607,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It actually works, but didn't quite work for *me*","I'm a dude with different textured hair, some is straight, some is wavy, but it constantly feels dry like straw.  I've tried many leave in conditioners that work for about 1-2 hours, after that my hair goes back to it's prior state.  This stuff by carol's daughter actually works...  It smooths out your hair and keeps it from frizzing or poofing, it really does.. and it worked all day.  So it gets 4 stars.  I deduct 1 star simply because it was sort of sticky feeling, almost like a pomade.. but not quite.  My hair wasn't able to ""flow"" and move with this, it seemed to hold it in place.. This was so close to being a perfect product for me, I just wish it didn't seem to kind of ""glue"" my hair.  But so far, it's the only thing I've tried that actually kept it looking conditioned and lush."
608,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy & Does Not Work,"It smells nice, nice consistency, nice idea. But it simply does not work. My hairdresser really likes it, and she puts it on my edges after she braids my hair. Literally, by the time I walk out of the door (5 minutes later), my edges are already lifted, and this gel has turned into a sticky grease. Just to make sure, I purchased this at the store, and I have confirmed it does not work for me. I have very kinky African hair, and when I use this product, it slicks my edges down for about 5 minutes, before turning into sticky white grease, and having my edges lift and coil back up. I would not recommend this product."
609,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Like sticky vaseline.,"I am currently in the market for a good edge control/gel to keep me from sweating out my hairline in this ridiculous 90 degree heat.I decided to give this a try since it claimed to be a drier formula that wouldn't flake or dry my hair out. When I initially put it on my hair it was tacky and seemed to be doing the trick. I put my scarf on to set it, but 15 mins later when I took it off it was as if I'd never put anything there. My hairline was kind of greasy and shiny (I assume it was due to the beeswax) and my hair had already curled back up.Usually I have pretty good luck with Carol's Daughter products, but I should've known this wouldn't work when it claimed to be moisturizing."
610,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Battle of the Edges...,Allow me to start by saying I'm Sicilian. My hair has always been wild & my edges have always been a HUGE pain to manage. After trying many methods to control / lay my edges I was about to give up until I bought (of all things) the leave-in conditioner. It's a freakin' miracle. My hair is soft has shine & best of all my edges are finally manageable. Good-bye electrocuted sheep hair!

612,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not even a 5 minute hold,"This doesn't hold. I use on my new growth; my natural hair is soft. It holds while I""m applying, I brush and put on a head scarf to make sure hair stays down. Seconds after scarf is removed, the hair curls back and look sweaty like I just had a workout. Waste of money! Oh it does smell great!"
613,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Edge Control Smoother For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Aloe and Honey, Clear Edge Smoother, Edge Tamer, 2 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,works wonderfully without residue,"This works great for me!  I read the other reviews and that hasn't been my experience at all.  I have moderately wavy hair, with parts that fall loose and start curling or sticking straight up like crazy, especially if I didn't begin the day with wet hair (i.e. if I washed it the day before).  I've never been able to figure out how to tame those flyaways and stick-ups, until I tried this product!  At the end of the day, the hair around my cowlicks and crowns is NOT sticking up!  It's amazing.  I think that's what this product is intended for -- not removing overall frizz (really need good conditioner for that!) but for ""edge control""  -- the little bits of your hairstyle that just won't go the right way, or stay the right way, the hairs that have a mind of their own.  This works awesomely for that.I've used it for three or four days in a row and my hair still doesn't look greasy where I'm using it.  It looks a lot like petroleum jelly (mostly clear) and has the consistency of lip balm, or possibly just a tad softer.It's also worth pointing out that while it's fairly expensive, the amount needed is microscopic--so microscopic that it's hard to even get out as little as needed--and I expect that this little tub will last for months and months, even on my waist-length thick hair.FINALLY my hair looks just as neat on the days I don't wash it as it does on the days when I do!  Love this stuff."

Some dry out my edges, some caused breakage, some lasted an hour and then I had to reapply.  Carol's Daughter's Edge Control is ridiculously amazingly exactly what you need. My hair is natural and it worked so beautifully.  I even used a bit to finish my style on the rest of my hair when I straighten it and it worked on both hair textures. I really appreciate all the good ingredients that go into this product that not only make my hair look great but also nourish my hair. Its not heavy, feels light, glides on but is dense enough to actually work.  Love it!!"

   I've tried other products from Carol's Daughter that never seemed to work well on my 4c hair, even after washing a bunch of HSN segments. I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"

It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite!!,"It's AMAZING!! It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I no longer need curl gels or creams after the shower! I just let it air dry and my curls are so bouncy and defined! I’m very pleased with my purchase!I just apply the cream mainly to the bottom half of my hair after my conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse!"

6,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Conditioner I've Used,"This is the best conditioner I've found to work with my hair. I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."

If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."

It is now a permanent event in my weekly hair routine. I use it in my LCO method and it leaves my hair so soft when it dries. A little goes a long way so be careful, because it is heavy."

BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."

Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."

Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."

15,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough moisture,This curl quenching moisturizer didn’t provide as much moisture as I would have liked. I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.

I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."

I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that. Smells amazing, slight crunch to it which I like, gives shine, and great hold"

I have not been disappointed with this shampoo.  My hair is extremely dry due to having several processes on it.  I am always looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help with the dryness.  I am very happy with the results.

I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."

I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."
21,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product. Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.

I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back! It's now on my Amazon Prime subscription list forever...and cheaper here than anywhere I have looked. Thanks for making my hair happy again!"

Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."

The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type. I don't know if I am 4a,b, or c, but I am definitely more kinky/curly than wavy."

I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend this product."

The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."

The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."

This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

Who knew that the only problem was that my hair is much more dry than it used to be and the products I’ve been using (just coconut oil) were not going to work for this next level dryness.

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all. I even tried to mix it up in hopes that the consistency would come back but it’s just not working. The scent is still the same but the consistency is just not it. I don’t know if they changed the formula or this is just a bad batch but it’s horrible."

It has a very mild pleasant scent. I used it after shampoo and conditioner. After towel drying my hair, I flipped my head over and used 2 quarter size scoops and applied to the tips. Then I did the same thing at my roots surrounding my face. But the greatest thing was that I didn't habe ti do or add anything else to get defined curls and waves. This is my new go-to. I also bought the conditioner and I am buying the shampoo next."

I read many reviews before trying another new product for my natural 4B-C hair.  I probably have about 3 different hair types.  I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming.

To the point, the little moisture that the product does add to my hair is just not worth putting up with the chemical coconut smell."

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.

I coil my hair myself, this product gives what is promised, the shine, greatly reduced shrinkage when my hair dries after application, a little crunchy after drying but the days to follow the hold was great and softness.

The scent is amazing. I have fine hair with a 2C wave. I cut the creme with a little water and put it on very wet hair then let dry naturally. It brings out the curl like nothing else I've used, and the curl holds even after a brush out. I refresh between washes with light spray of water and very watered down creme, and the curls last up to 3 days this way. I can get rid of all the other curl cremes now."

Usually they make her curls too sticky or gelled looking. I don’t actually rinse this product out like the directions say to. I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day. If I have a few minutes I finger curl it in sections and me it air dry that way. The curls dry soft and defined. She said she gets compliments at school a lot."

I ended having to soak my hair in coconut oil and washing with a dove bar of soap. If they removed the fragrance it would be an easy 5 stars.

I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."

I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."

When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."

First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."

But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"
630,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this product as a layering product. I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

Moisturized my hair, curled it more than my previous shea moisture smoothie cream, but after a week I noticed my hair was drier. So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

I do not have dyed or bleached hair, so I can't speak to its effectiveness for those types, but for normal/dry and fine hair it was great.I also enjoyed the coconut scent, it felt very beach appropriate.The container naturally tells you that you should be using their whole product line, but I did not notice any drawbacks from just using the hair mask by itself."

Leaves Hair Soft and Manageable,"I use shampoo and conditioner together, so I am going to review Carols Daughter Coco Creme Sulfate-free Shampoo and Carols Daughter Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner together.I really like and often use various Carols Daughter haircare products. No other shampoo or conditioner seems to work as well on my hair as the Carols Daughter products. My hair is soft and manageable after shampooing and remains so even a day or two after shampooing. Not every shampoo and conditioner offers that. Plus the products are Sulfate and Paraben free.The Carols Daughter Coco Creme Sulfate-free Shampoo goes on thick and smooth. That's also true of Carols Daughter Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner. It doesn't take much of either product to get the job done and it doesn't require a rinse and repeat either. One treatment with a modest amount of each product does the job.I have stated in previous hair and skin product reviews that I dislike products that contain fragrances. Carols Daughter Coco Creme Sulfate-free Shampoo and Carols Daughter Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner both have a fragrance. However, this is one product that deserves an exception.

Leaves My Hair Soft and Manageable,"I use shampoo and conditioner together, so I am going to review Carols Daughter Coco Creme Sulfate-free Shampoo and Carols Daughter Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner together.I really like and often use various Carols Daughter haircare products. No other shampoo or conditioner seems to work as well on my hair as the Carols Daughter products. My hair is soft and manageable after shampooing and conditioning and it remains so even a day or two after shampooing. Not every shampoo and conditioner offers that.The Carols Daughter Coco Creme Sulfate-free Shampoo goes on thick and smooth. That's also true of Carols Daughter Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner. It doesn't take much of either product to get the job done and it doesn't require a rinse and repeat either. One treatment with a modest amount of each product does the job.I have stated in previous hair and skin product reviews that I dislike products that contain fragrances. Carols Daughter Coco Creme Sulfate-free Shampoo and Carols Daughter Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner both have a fragrance. However, this is one product that deserves an exception. I actually enjoy the coco-like fragrance.Carols Daughter seems to have made a change in the plunger on the Coco Cream products.

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

It does make her curls pop and shine! It does provide a hold and makes her hair a tad bit crunchy. It isn't too hard so I am ok with it. It keeps her curly hair looking nice and shiny for the day. It has a nice smell. It is a great value for the price and size of the container. I recommend this product

My hair is curly/wavy and extremely dry, like I can never seem to get enough moisture.Out of the jar, it seems like it's going to be great, like the consistency of a body butter product. It feels really moisturizing.This product is heavy, weighs down the hair a ton, makes it look really dull/unhealthy, it's hard to run your fingers through, and the hair feels sticky.Today is my 2nd time using it.

This one is heavenly!  When you have curls, you don't want heavy products.  This mist smells amazing.  I love how lightweight it is.  I sprayed this on my clean hair, once while damp and again while dry.  My curls were not sticky or stiff, but shiny and smooth.  While I do not have very dry hair, I felt that this mist added a nice amount of hydration to my hair.  I will definitely use this as a refresher for my curls on days that I do not wash my hair.  Best of all, this product is free of silicone and parabens.  I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this curl mist.  Love it!"
645,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

The scent of the product is amazing it smells really good. The gel is light weight and does not weigh down hair. The gel cream is a little tacky or sticky when applying but that feeling goes away. I use this product on my natural hair and my weaves and it works well. Also I love the size of the jar you get a lot of product to last you a little while depending on how much you apply.

While I still have frizz, I feel like I'm able to have more days where my hair is down versus it being up in a bun or in a ponytail. I love the smell of the spray and I also like how much product is in the bottle. I'm able to use this to refresh my hair throughout the week or for what I need additional moisture added to my hair. I would definitely get this again because of how much I've been enjoying my curls. I also like how long the mist is when dispensing the product into my hair; one spritz goes a long way."
648,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Cost effective and smells wonderful,"I have always used a mask or extra conditioner once a week.  I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

My hair is thick, coarse, dry, and damaged courtesy of heat styling, the use of hair color, etc. This product does seem to make it a little softer which is nice, but I can't say that it imparts all that much moisture, and it doesn't do a lot when it comes to easing the detangling process.It's not a bad conditioner; it's just that I was expecting it to do more. I'm sure that people with different hair types and textures might see more benefits after using this."

I’ve always been a fan of carols daughter but this was my first time trying this. The smell is very pleasing as well. I have a 3c/4a hair type and I like to use after I apply my products. i don’t section I just spray right on top and where I feel I need it but mostly focusing on the roots and ends. I even like to apply it at the end of the day after I take it out of my protective styles. It helps aid in my dryness. It takes my curls to a new level of definition making them less frizzy and last longer in my wash and go process. I would love to try more from this line!
651,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",HALL OF FAME,TOP 100 REVIEWER,"Thick and creamy this sulfate-free shampoo generates a luxurious lather and has a pleasant light scent that is suitable for all household members. Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."
652,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,shampoo is NOT moisturizing,"maybe i'm crazy, or maybe a lot of the places online to READ reviews for the SHAMPOO are misleading.I have very ringlety, VERY thick 3c hair. I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

I really like this company. I love that their products, like this one, has NO silicones, parabens, petroleum, mineral oil or artificial colors.  I find the fragrance of this one to be light and refreshing overall. Not overpowering for a man and I believe lots of women will also enjoy it.  Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.  I honestly have received and reviewed many different shampoo and conditioner products from different companies. Carols daughter is one of my favorite. This is a company I would buy from again."

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

I let it air dry and it made my hair shiny and the curls were very pronounced. It didn't dry sticky either. You get a 16 oz tub so it will last. I would definitely recommend this product.

This stuff has a very strong, sharp artificial scent that, for me, is a total turn off. I'm sensitive to strong fragrances and won't be able to use this at all. So bummed!"

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes.

The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo.

This Coco Creme conditioner is pretty nice, but I like the thicker consistency and scent of the Rhassoul Clay much better.This conditioner has more of a shampoo consistency in that it's not very thick.  It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.  If you're a fan of coconut scents, though, this would be a good choice to try out."

I’ve used the Carol’s Daughter Monoi mask in the past.PROS: It made my hair very soft.CONS: Though I didn’t dislike the fragrance, it’s not what I’d choose for my hair. It smells like a perfume and after a few hours I was beginning to develop a headache.I preferred the smell of the monoi mask I’ve used in the past. If I purchase a hair mask again, that’s the one I will use."

It makes the hair so softened smells good too. It seems to be like water but kind of like a leave in conditioner. I used it to do the initial style then I used it to refresh's he style the following few days and it was just amazing. it's like water in terms of consistency and it is a fine mist but a little goes a long way.

I have straight colored hair and have been swimming a lot this summer. I was hoping this was the product that would take some dryness away from my dry hair ends. Well, it felt creamy in my hair and it rinsed out well. I let my hair air dry and the ends were drier looking than ever! I don't know why this product doesn't work for me. I like to try lots of hair products and am giving this one 3 stars for the scent alone. Maybe it will work for you."

This Carol's Daughter hair mask worked well for me. It is intended to be used as a weekly treatment, which is what I have been doing for the past month. The difference in the shine and manageability of my hair is evident. My hair feels softer and the damage less noticeable. I happen to like the smell - a light coconut scent. Although I have some Carol's Daughter shampoo, this works just as well with my normal shampoo. It's definitely worth a try if you have color treated and/or damaged hair."

This product works great with both. One daughter has tight curls and my other has very lose curls. I love that you can use this spray on wet or dry hair.

I have a somewhat difficult time finding products that work well for my hair. It seems as if most of the ones that are meant for curly hair assume curly hair is also stiff and wiry, so they over-soften and leave my hair flat. Most of those meant for fine hair are too stripping and leave my hair dry and unmanageable. This Carol’s Daughter shampoo strikes just the right balance. I like the pump dispenser (a great improvement over their twist-top bottles) and it takes only a little to clean my hair thoroughly. Carol’s Daughter has become by far my favorite line of shampoos and conditioners."

As it has thickened it gets so dried out if she does not condition and wash it everyday. I don't think hair should be washed that often. I wanted something that would help. She has been using this for a couple weeks and I have noticed a softening. It has a coconut, vanilla scent that just smells amazing. I wish it had more natural ingredients, you shouldn't have to pay a price like this for an ingredient list like that. It is nice and thick and lathers well and is ok for color treated hair."

It gave me hair a good enough curl, but it was on the crunchy side, which I didn't love.  My hair is odd, curly in some parts, wavy or straight in others.  The curly parts definitely curled, it wasn't enough help for the wavy/straight parts to follow suit though.  It does smell nice and a little goes a long way."

If you want a similar price range, stick with maui moisture or shea moisture conditioners and leave-ins."

But don’t hold that against the company! If you have dry, damaged, processed hair, this conditioner is a lifesaver. It is probably one of the only hair products I’ve used that has resulted in a visible improvement in my hair. I have long highlighted hair which has never been the healthiest from years of color. Using this conditioner regularly for the past few weeks has made my hair look healthier and shinier. Even the ends (currently way overdue for a trim) are less split. And it smells like heaven! Highly recommend."

She uses coconut moisturizer for her hair because it was recommended by her hairdresser, but she wasn't thrilled having to leaving it in her hair for several hours. So the idea of a moisturize and conditioner in one was enticing. But the problem with this product is that it contains alcohol, and that, as most people know, dries your hair. So it is counter intuitive... the benefits of the coconut oil get erased by the drying factor of the alcohol. Oh well."

I like the smell of the coconut oil, but it also has some artificial fragrance that irritates my eyes (even though it did not run into my eyes.) My thick, curly hair absorbed it well enough, though the product is a bit thin. My hair, once dry, looks nice, but I have difficulty with the wet comb-through.  With a conditioner that works well, I can comb my wet hair easily.  So this product is a bit of a disappointment."

Some, like this conditioner, I like less than others.My hope was for a light cocoa butter-ish smell and that it would work for my daughter's leaning-toward-oily hair. Sadly, the scent is very strong and sickeningly sweet (I do have sensitive sinuses) while it enhances the oiliness of her hair. She only used it a few times before we had to stop. I highly recommend the brand (they've been my go-to for almost 4 years) but I don't recommend the conditioner if you have a lot of natural oils."

It is a fairly thick cream and it rubs into my hair well. It also rinses out thoroughly. The fragrance is kind of strong. It's a pleasant scent and it lingers while my hair is still wet, but it fades once my hair is dry. The container has ample to last a long time. The screw top works well.

I use it two or three times a week and it leaves my hair feeling soft and looking healthy."

Love the pump dispenser.  I really don't notice my hair being any different using this product than other conditioners I've tried.  So I'd consider this a solid choice but maybe not something that stands out enough to warrant the current price.  It would take a chemist to decipher the ingredients list to compare this with a three dollar bottle of Suave Professional conditioner and understand how one claims to be better than the other.  Since I'm not a chemist, I'll probably stick with a more budget friendly product."

Very llite and pleasant fragrance.  The richness of the shampoo struck me as most shampoo has a different viscosity and feel.  I decided that I would Not apply a heavier conditioner, as I did the first time [the accompanying conditioner], as it left my hair feeling lame and over processed with residual.  It didn’t irritate my scalp, which I am rather sensitive.  Nice shampoo with a ‘rich’ feel, but go light on the conditi7if you use one."

It is a strong coconut scent that lingers throughout the day.  Even late in the afternoon, I can still smell it on my hair and it makes me smile.  This may be a turnoff for others because it is very strong, but it works for me.  It also doesn't weight down my hair and has enough moisture to get me through the day in my dry climate.

I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls.

I have 3a/3b curls that get extremely frizzy. It doesn’t do anything magical for them but it does help. However the scent for me is so horrible that I won’t repurchase. It lingers too even after your hair drys.

836,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Shaping Cream Gel, with Coconut Oil, Coconut Milk, Silicone Free, Paraben Free Hair Gel for Curly Hair , Mineral Oil Free, for Very Dry Hair, 16 Oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,Spent 30 years looking for this,I’ve literally been looking years for something like this for my very curly 3b/c frizz prone hair.  Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

0,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Will not be purchasing Carol's Daughter Products any longer.,I have used this product for years. They have either changed the recipe or the product I recieved had gone rancid. It was not its usual buttery color but rather a stark white. The consistency was that of the kids play slime. It did not have its usual soothing vanilla scent. It was more of a chemical vanilla. I stopped using the Black Vanilla shampoo last year for the same reason guess this product is off of my shopping list also.

I've decided that although the formula might have changed, it still had some positive changes on my hair. Morning after and my hair looked shinier and softer (although didn't felt thag soft, just looked). It also had a nice scent left on it. My hair is dyed (wasn't in the past), straight and fine.---I was first introduced to this product a few years back when I found it at my local TJ Maxx. After the first try, I fell in love. The smell was fantastic and I could immediately see a difference after using the product as directed in the back label. I purchased it through Amazon recently, but even the color of the product itself was different (before was more of a darker cream color and now was much closer to a white). It still smelled good but not as great as before, it was a much lighter scent. Regarding results, my hair was left smelling nice and vanilla-y but I can't tell any difference other than that, whereas before I could tell how soft my hair became from using it. Perhaps a change in formula caused this considerably different experience."

7,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good! But I still prefer Sacred Tiare,"Scent: I tried this because vanilla is my all-time fav scent. Unfortunately, the smell isn't as amazing as, say Warm Vanilla Sugar from Bath and Body Works. But, it's def not bad. And it's not a super strong smell, so I don't think it'll offend anyone but the most staunch vanilla-haters.Softness/Shininess: My main concern for my hair is improving luster. I figured this would be about the same or better than Sacred Tiare (my intro to Carol's Daughter products). I have 2B hair (with some 2A and 2C) that's not terribly dry, but it does get somewhat frizzy and dull randomly. Sacred Tiare was a godsend for my hair; it made my hair super shiny and super soft after 1 use. This product hasn't had quite the same magical effect, but it has made my hair shinier and softer than if I hadn't used the product. I think I would need to use a lot more of this or leave it in a lot longer (not sure... I'll try both) to get the same results as a tiny bit of Sacred Tiare.Overall: I will be keeping this jar, but I won't be buying it again. I will go back to Sacred Tiare once I finish with this."

I use it every other time I wash my hair so I don't get build up. I hand comb to dry my straight, frizzy, damaged hair and this stuff has good slick to do that. I shampoo, leave this in for a min 10 minutes, rinse, and use argan oil afterward. I give a lot of credit to the wheat germ oil in it. I've always used conditioners with that ingredient in them.This also works for my friend who has fine, super curly hair. She doesn't like weight, so she washes it out completely. An all over wonderful product for our frizzy hair."

Call me impressed!  I love the scent of these black vanilla products.  I tried the travel size shampoo and leave in with no results.  I tried the hair milk.. Nothin.  I tried this smoothie expecting failure.  At last I was wrong.  Small bottle for the price.  Weird texture and I only had to use a lil.  Goes on smooth. I parted my hair in the center and each side into quarters. I put on a platic cap I kept it in overnight.  My hair was soooo soft it was unreal.  I have 4b/c low porosity natural hair.  I think if I add a heat cap the results will be even better. My hair was volumimous yet smooth.

252,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Deep Conditioner,"For the price, this product is very hard to beat. I've used a lot of high-end conditioners and this is on par with many of them. My hair is caucasian, thick, color treated many times over, almost halfway down my back, and in need of a trim. My ends are pretty crispy, but I hide it pretty well with all my various smoothing products. (My hair takes forever to grow and trims only seem to make the problem worse.) The consistency is creamy and thick and even on my long hair, I don't use very much so I expect this container to last a while. I don't notice any significant fading of my hair (currently light blondish reddish copper). I have been using this in conjunction with the Black Vanilla shampoo and they pair well together. Since my hair is dry, I use this as my regular conditioner (I usually wash my hair about twice a week).The scent is a warm, creamy vanilla...if you remember the original Glade vanilla scent from back in the day, this is pretty much that scent exactly. It isn't too noticeable when it dries, which I prefer when it comes to sweet smells like this in my hair.I squeeze the water out of my hair in the shower, massage this in to the lower half of my hair, and let it sit while I do all my other stuff, occasionally rubbing it in to help keep the hair from getting too cold and closing the cuticle. My hair is very silky when I rinse it out, and after drying and straightening it's very soft and healthy feeling. My ends are still slightly dry so I do use a tiny dab of a smoothing treatment on my very ends after styling as a finishing touch, but I could get away with just the hair smoothie if I needed to.For even better results, put a shower cap on after massaging this into your hair and use the hair dryer for about 5 minutes, then let sit until the hair starts to cool and then rinse out.This is a friggin' bargain for the results, and I especially appreciate that the formula is not loaded with waxes and dimethicone which just coat your hair to give the illusion that it's healthy / shiny while blocking real conditioning ingredients from being able to penetrate the hair shaft, leaving your hair in increasingly worse condition. This contains a lot of natural oils and cocoa butter that would benefit pretty much everyone of all ethnicities and hair types except those with super greasy hair. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to others as a great deep conditioning treatment."
253,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"My beautiful 16"" silky hair quickly became a 10"" mane of ...","A few hours ago, I purchased this product at my local Sally's Beauty Supply store. Since last November I had been experimenting with different colors on my hair because of emotional trauma I am still currently going through. I often use my hair as a getaway.So, wanting to get away as dramatically as possible, this past March I went from my natural African-American black hair to a honey-blonde on my own. I had always done my own color jobs and they have turned out perfectly, but the bleach is what sent my hair into ruins. My beautiful 16"" silky hair quickly became a 10"" mane of hard, dry, split ended, frustrating hair as it broke off terribly. Everyone has asked if I cut my hair, and I just lie and reply the affirmative.Anyway, after seeing a random advertisement for Carol's Daughter on Facebook, and coincidentally clicking on a link to their webpage, I decided to try this product. Seeing as I was close to shaving my head, I knew I couldn't go wrong. After wetting my hair and applying the smoothie throughout it, then putting on a plastic cap, I let it sit in my hair for about 3 hours. I washed it out and then co-washed with my normal conditioner. I blow dried and straightened my hair, and I have to say it doesn't even feel like the hair I woke up sadly to this morning! It's actually shiny and soft and...bouncy! My hair hasn't been bouncy since March! It almost feels like my hair that I had back in November. As I continue to use this product, I will update my review in about a month or so as I use it to deep condition every week until then. I have to say, this hair smoothie may just be my hair savior in a jar!"

My hair was looking drier than normal even after conditioning.  I thought I would try this and have used it for a few days now as a leave-in conditioner and what a difference.  I use just a little, rub between my hands and apply it to towel dried hair.  It does not weigh it down.  My hair was immediately soft and shiny after just day one.  No static from the very low humidity and my hair looks and feels great.  I have not tried it as a rinse out conditioner but as a leave in it works great."

262,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dang near perfect,"I found this brand by accident while on a work trip and didn't want to travel with a half empty bottle of shampoo. This is a line that smells amazing, the hair smoothie works miracles on the first try (after a horrendous dye accident that destroyed my hair and made it so dry), and is decently priced. My only complaint is that you have to use a bit more shampoo at one time than normal shampoos, but it always feels clean and looks shiny so it's definitely not a deal breaker. I hope this line never dies out."

281,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,TL;DR: Turned my bird lady hair into something presentable!,"I was very pleasantly surprised. I had frizzy, extremely dry hair that stayed dry at the ends no matter how much conditioner I slathered on. I occasionally would put oil on my hair to control the frizziness and static, but I don't like how my hair feels after using it (greasy, heavy, etc) so I don't use it much. I searched for what seemed like hours for the right deep conditioner (because apparently there are a million different types, and they all do different things) and I came across this and decided to just give it a go. I mean, it can't get much worse, right?When opened the package, it was sealed up and nothing was spilling out, so that's a good sign. I noticed that it definitely had a shea butter or coconut oil consistency, and I wasn't sure if this would be a good thing or a bad thing. The smell is fantastic. To me, it smells like a candle; my husband said I smelled like cookies. After my shower, I decided to just go for the kill and skip using it as regular conditioner: I put it on the ends of my damp hair and put on a shower cap and turned on my blow-dryer. I sat on my bathroom floor blow-drying for 10 minutes, and after the 10 minutes was up, I rinsed well and went about my day.I noticed that my hair dried slower than it normally does and that it felt a little sticky, but it wasn't uncomfortable. After it dried, I could tell a difference. My normally frizzy and tangled hair was really silky and soft.  Like, TV-level soft and smooth. It didn't knot as easily, and I even noticed that my natural wave was more prominent. I really like this stuff. I think I'll continue to buy. And the best part: I smell like cookies!"
282,"Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Hair Smoothie For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin B5, Paraben Free Hair Treatment, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Use as Hair Gel,"I am in the military and have to slick my hair back in uniform. Using the hair gel is tough on my hair and frankly feels gross. So I use this to slick my hair back and it works really well. I have to put on a helmet throughout the day and there's never any flacking like with gel. Also, i use this when I'm styling my hair and need something to keep my flyaways down I use this and only this. Great product, It's a different formula now than when I started using the product, which I think the old version is way better the new formula still gets the job done."

The shampoo made my hair feel brittle, the spray conditioner did the same, I threw it away. I just tried the smoothie the other day, because I know that sometimes different products in a line work better than others. It was wasn't good to, or for my natural hair. The product sat on my hair, opposed to melding with my strands. I did not use very much. I had to wash it out. If it works for other's natural hair, or processed hair, good on them. This is not a product I will ever be buying again. I really dislike wasting my money."

0,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,Scent non existant - Is this watered down with something?,"EDIT- Turns out that they changed the formula. I'm really sick of Carol's Daughter constantly changing the formulas for their products. I use alot of their stuff and it's gotten to the point where whenever I order something I have no idea what I am going to get. They've also changed their leave in and replenishing oil multiple times as well as the shampoo and conditioner.I just received this product in the mail and it smells like literal water with a barely noticeable hint of vanilla. My last bottle smelled fantastic. I'm not sure whether Carols Daughter altered the formula, or if the seller diluted it, but something is different and I am reluctant to put it in my hair."
1,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,They have changed the formula!!!,"This new oil is dry and drying. It does not add any moisture to black hair. It's is just a super thin layer of chemicals with an approximation of the original scent. I was expected to get moisturizing hair oil. This is is not moisturizing at all, even though the packaging is the same. Do not get the array of chemicals in the spray bottle. You will be better off preparing your own formulation with almond oil, vanilla, coconut oil (liquid form), and some calendula oil. This is not really Carol's Daughters as we knew it many years ago. So, for long-time lovers of Carol's daughter, this product false packaging and false advertising, and it not prepared for natural African-American hair texture--maybe weaves or braids, but not natural hair."
2,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",5.0 out of 5 stars,amazing shine!!! great on fried hair,"i bought this because my human hair wig was getting super frizzy and gross from having been dyed a lot. y’all who know, that bleach-fried hair is Not easy to get rid of. that whole issue is literally why i cut off all my hair and wear wigs in the first place, but i swear if i had this product earlier i’d probably still have gorgeous, long, pink (or whatever color) hair lol. basically, this is the best anti frizz spray i’ve ever encountered"
3,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't be fooled, this is NOT a moisturizer!","I guess I should have read the ingredients. I went off product description and reviews. If you're getting this for moisture know that it in itself is NOT a moisturizer! This is a SEALER! It has lots of oils that will SEAL moisture in your hair but that's it. There are ALOT of cheaper sealers. I use 100% virgin/unrefined organic coconut oil, or Extra virgin, organic, olive oil. This WILL NOT provide moisture. Water is not even listed in the ingredients! You can not have moisture without water. Water= moisture, oils=seal in moisture. A real moisturizer ALWAYS has WATER listed as one of the top ingredients. The people who have had success w this are probably using it after they shower, or when their hair is wet. This would work to keep the hair moisturized after applying water, but if you spray this on dry hair it will do nothing except add shine bc of the oil. That's not adding moisture."

Way too costly for the amount, let’s begin there. But it’s not a fine mist like sheen at all. Comes out in streams, which applies way too much product for your hair. It gets weighed down, and defeats the purpose of clean, flowy hair. Nice scent, but this is the reason many still use aerosol sprays.. for the evenness of application."

I love the black vanilla shampoo and conditioner, (though it does leave my hair heavy so I either use them separately or use conditioner only on the bottom of my hair). This stuff smells just like it, but I simply cannot use it. It's very oily and not the type of shine or mist I was hoping for. It makes my hair too greasy no matter how little I try to use. I've even tried spraying it on my fingers and doing it that way... yeah, no. But, it would likely be great for other hair types (mine is fine and dry). As would the shampoo & conditioner."

She has 1/2 relaxed and 1/2 natural hair, as she's growing out her relaxer. Her hair was bra strap length, but as she's been growing out her relaxer our hair dresser has been cutting more and more of the relaxer out of her hair. Also, because we're not experts at this type of transition, some of her hair was falling out because we weren't taking care of it properly.Now we know how to wash, condition and brow dry it so it doesn't fall out as much.One of the requirements of natural hair is oil. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! According to the hair dresser, there is never enough oil that's too much for natural hair. We're slowly learning that she's 100% correct. We use moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, we use a heat protectant spray before blow drying and then we use a sheen to give additional moisture to her hair.She uses it in the morning after she's styled her hair and at night before she puts her bonnet on her head. You don't have to spray a lot, just a few squirts will do. It gives her hair a nice sheen and it smells delicious!The best part? No Parabens, No Mineral Oil, No Artificial Colors, No Petroleum.Honestly, I wasn't sure if the formulation of Carl's Daughter's products would change after they were bought out by a large company. I'm glad to see they're staying true to their roots (pun intended) and keeping their products as natural as can be."

I'm also almost 58 so I have age related thinning and brittleness to deal with too.  My hair looks great when I just let it air dry but once a  comb or brush touches it: POOF!  Frizz city!I have used various anti-frizz products but didn't really like the way they made my hair feel.  This product makes my hair feel soft, look shiny and smell great.  I love this so much I cancelled my subscription to Fekkai glossing cream. I was initially afraid that this would make my hair too greasy since my hair is in the normal to fine range and anybody with fine hair knows how ""deadly"" oil can be, laying waste to many a hair style.  Not to worry.  Now, I just spray a little of this in my hands, rub them together, then rake my fingers through my damp hair.  Once dry I can brush my hair without frizz, just shine."
190,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"I decided to give this a try because I had heard Carols Daughter had some great products. I also knew CD was originally for AA hair, but the description said all hair types and I thought they might be branching out with this product. I gave it a try on my straight white girl hair and it was just too heavy, so I gave it to my biracial sister who has type 2&3 curls on her head of fine hair. She ends up straightening her hair and finds the Black Vanilla Moisture leaves her hair soft and shiny. She does not feel that it is heavy.  She said it gives enough weight to tame fly aways and keep her smooth.  It also works great when she pulls her hair back in a ponytail to work out. The fragrance is very strong (but nice) and could compete with your perfume."

I have type 3B, springy curls that are more frizzy and dry than kinky. So it's always a struggle to find something that's heavy enough to moisturize my curls but light enough not to weigh them down and make them greasy. This works well for days 2 - 5. I spray it on at night, do two strong twists, put on a silk scarf and then untwist in the morning for soft, shiny curls. I have no complaints. I'm really glad they carry it at Target bow. It's more affordable and accessible than when they only carried this line at Macy's. I hope people will continue to buy it. The smell is gentle and not at all overpowering like some natural hair care products. I plan to use this on my daughter's hair when she is a little older to keep it soft and manageable."

It smells amazing, the scent isn't too strong but it does stay with you for a while. And it REALLY does give a lot of shine. Use sparingly. You might want to try spraying a little in your hand or on your fingers if you're targeting a certain area. But yes, it does indeed give a nice 'sheen' to the hair and does seem to help moisturize (not surprising considering its oil ingredients). The bottle should last a long while. Just be aware that there is a scent to it if you're sensitive and might be a trial period if you're going to be spraying it on (just try a spritz or two at first)."

Since my waves are fine, it's too much to spray this directly on my hair, so I use one spray in my palm and then smooth it over my hair.  It adds a lovely shine.I didn't realize before ordering this that it does contain silicone (in the form of cyclomethicone), so if you're following the Curly Girl Method, I'd suggest using 

Carols Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Pure Hair Oil, 4.3 Ounce

It smells nice, but the scent is light.  The sprayer functions well, but I do tend to spray it onto my hands and distribute that way.  A little helps a lot.  I do find it takes a while to absorb into my hair, so I typically apply it at night.  Adds shine and hydration and helps my hair look healthier."
196,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"For reference, I have baby fine hair that gets oily at the scalp line and is dry on the ends and at times snaps easily. The instructions on this oil type spray, say to spray on dry hair. If I do that, it makes my hair look very oily and limp. It works much better on my fine hair if I use it while my hair is wet and then spray only 2 sprays and pick it through. The best thing about this spray is the pleasant and sweet almond and vanilla scent. I would not recommend this for very fine hair like mine, it isn't bad but, I think this would work better on coarser and much drier hair."

I had not tried it before so I jumped at the chance to give it a try. This spray was a little more greasy than I expected. I have fine hair, so it is easy to weigh down. I realized I needed to use less. It doesn’t take much so use sparingly. It does give an shine to the hair and has a nice smell."
198,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Hair Sheen for Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, Paraben Free Hair Sheen, 4.3 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use oil a lot in my hair. It helps keep it from drying out as I use a blow dryer and flat iron daily. It also makes a good texturizer. This formula is less greasy and it sprays a fine mist over large sections. I use it sometimes before I use the flatiron or after I'm done I will use it if my hair seems dry. My hair gets soft and shiny but doesn't look oily. This can be used on any type of hair.

I tried it on my husbands hair, he's 3C and it made him look glossy :) also, the next morning, it was still moisturized. Kind of on the greasy side, but maybe I sprayed too much.I have 4 C hair so of course the effects will be different. It more so kept it moisturized than shiny. If I were to blow it out, it would probably stay shiny as well. :)Major bonus...the smell"

Otherwise, this didn't moisturize my hair at all.  I have thick, curly, dry hair.  It left my already dry hair even drier and feeling like straw.  Also, it made it really hard to comb through when wet...almost like I put powder in my hair.  Anyway, I will continue to use it, but only lightly as a hair fragrance."

I suffer from dry everything.  I am 68 years old.  My skin is dry, my eyes are dry and of course my hair is dry.

0,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Carols daughttterrr YESSSS LOC method,This stuff is SUUUUPER thick but if your hair is as dry as mine. Then you NEED this m i use this as a cream in my LOC method for my 4c/4b type hair and ive received nothing but positive results. Just dont over do it because youll get a grey tint film over your hair and it'll slightly cause build up. OTHERWISE EPIC IN A JARbtw it lasted me damn there a month and a half
1,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Type 4 hair - Top moisturizer - Twist-outs, Braid-outs +","This fully moisturizes 4 a/b/c hair with medium porosity. I like this even better than healthy hair butter. I wash my hair, twist it with Marguerite's Magic, let it dry, take it out and my hair is super soft."
2,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Good on 4c hair!,"I never really try new creams because I’m usually disappointed so I just stick with My old faithful TGIN butter cream. However, I had a urge to start trying more stying products so I gave this a try and I’m glad I did! It’s really thick which is a plus for me and It makes my hair so shiny, soft and really manageable when combing through. The only thing I initially didn’t really enjoy was the smell but, I can get use to it because i really like how this makes my hair feel and look! I think it will work for any hair type but, if your hair is a looser texture use a smaller amount."
3,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,An old time favorite.,I used this product years ago and for some reason I got away from the brand as a whole. I noticed lately my hair looks dull and lifeless no matter what I use and none of the many oils and shampoos I have purchased were helping to do anything but weigh my hair down and make it feel and look dirty. I grabbed this in an attempt to salvage my hair and I'm glad I did. From the first use my hair was softer and looked like there was new life in it. I've rubbed it into my scalp and said goodbye to the itchy feeling the winter brought there. I've noticed less shedding come wash day too. I'm in love all over again.
4,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hair cream,"Really like.  I read previous reviews before using and many said a little goes a long way  If too much is used, a residue will form.  After co wash I put my oils also Vera and used this for a twist out  I fingered combed it using carol’s daughter mimosa hair honey  on my fingers and palm  Loving hair day!"
5,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,The worst garbage I’ve ever used,This is thicker than any body butter I’ve ever used. It refused to distribute thru my hair and made it nearly un brushable so I don’t know how this has any renewing or replenishing properties. It actually was so bad I had to re wash my whole head and then re take a shower when the itch and grime of it’s transfer to my body kicked in. The fragrance isn’t so much lavender like it mentions and is really quite strong- I like strong smells and this one got to me. Seriously the worst thing I’ve ever ordered from amazon
6,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,would not recommend,"i have high porosity hair, i tried this for both a twist out & a moisturizer and it was awful for both. It was extremely thick, gave me terrible build up & i used a small amount of product considering it was so thick. Thicker creams usually are beneficial for my hair, but there was something about this one that just wasn’t very hydrating, caused major build up, & it felt like it was just sitting on top of my hair.. All to say, i would not recommend for high porosity hair"

8,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,You will love what it does to your hair.,"I love this product and it's one of those you won't believe until you use it.  My hair was over perm.  Then I went natural for several months and didn't take care of it at all.  I was just waiting until I was forced to wear a wig.  Then my attitude changed.  I wanted to try again with my own hair.  I saw this product and decided to give it a try.  I had tried everything else on the market many years before.  I wore my hair in a fizzy, patted down, nappy natural.  My hair had grown a little with me wearing a natural and not combing it but it was in really bad shape from lack of care.  No moisture, no shine, frizzy and no life.  I washed my hair with a shampoo I hoped would lighten my gray then I used this cream and oil while it was still wet.  The most notable thing the first time I used it was how easy it was to comb my hair.  There were no tangles, less friz and only a few strains of my hair came out in the comb.  I believed that was because it had been so long since I combed it.  My hair was still easy to comb two days later although I had only treated my hair that once.  By the third time I used the cream and oil my hair was as soft as baby hair, manageable, laid flat, no friz and possible to comb with my fingers.  I Still have dull gray hair and think that maybe why my hair isn't shining yet.  The nap of my hair actually feels wavy.  My hair is longest at the nap of my neck.  Never had curly, soft or wavy hair.  I felt a dramatic difference after the third time I used it and that was all within the first week.  That's when I fell in love and knew I never wanted to be without either of them.  I'm so impressed I have ordered the shampoo and conditioner.  I have them all scheduled for redelivery every two months that's how much I love it.  The only thing left to say is you won't be sorry if you try it."
9,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product,"I love this product.  It’s not sticky or too heavy for my naturally curly hair, and it gives me the perfect amount of control and locks in moisture."
10,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,My locs were breaking off really bad especially in the front,"Works well on my hair. My locs were breaking off really bad especially in the front, but this product has helped bring my hair back to life. It's light so it doesn't feel too heavy on my hair. The smell is great. A bit on the expensive side, but in many ways, it's worth it. And since I can't purchase it in the neighborhood I live in since the hair shops out here do not cater to Black women, Amazon saves the day once again. I will continue to purchase this product as long as it continues to do wonders on my hair. Very pleased."
11,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Feels Wonderful.,"This stuff is wonderful for my hair.  Some moisturizers leave the hair a little crunchy after it dries.  This moisturizer keeps my hair soft and completely moisturized.  I really like Carol's Daughter products.Update: 7/12/21. This is still keeping my 4c high porosity hair moisturized.  The problem is that  I was just getting to order another jar, and the price jumped from $7.00 to $14.00.  What is going on?  Shame on the merchant for hiking up the price so high.  $14.00 is too much."
12,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes such a difference,This stuff is GOLDEN!! It’s like liquid gold. Lasting moisture.. makes a difference and your hair feels much smoother and softer. I recommend!!
13,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes hair soft and manageable.,When I first used this on my daughter’s hair I did not get the expected results. I was disappointed and put it away. My daughter has natural black hair type 4c and I needed a product that would make her hair manageable without me having to straighten her hair all the time and one that would keep her hair from breaking and tangling. So several months later I decided to try it again and this time round it worked. It made it easy for me to detangle and brush without hurting her and without breaking the hair. It makes the hair soft and easy to work with. I highly recommend it and if it doesn’t work the first time don’t toss it away just give it another try it might end up working like it did for me.
14,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic product, good price","I've ordered this a couple of times from Amazon.com.  Previously, I ordered it from the manufacturer.  I don't understand why the price of this product varies from order to order on Amazon, but to date it's still $3 to $6 less expensive than ordering from the manufacturer (not including shipping from the manufacturer--I have Prime with Amazon).  Price aside, this is my single favorite hair-care product.  I have semi-coarse, thick, curly hair that has ALWAYS been dry.  I use this on my hair right after shampooing as a leave-in conditioner.  On my type of hair, it NEVER flattens or leaves my hair greasy--only soft.  And it helps to smooth frizziness (no product I've ever tried has ever completely tamed them).  This is the one hair product I can't do without."
15,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent moisturizer,"I’ve used Carol’s daughter for a long time. My hair had become dry due to a medication & treatments. This is perfect for restoring the moisture back into your hair. I apply daily at bedtime along with brushing my hair. I don’t have to use much. Don’t pack on, you should measure based on the length of your hair. This product doesn’t leave any residue after it’s brushed on the hair."
16,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Easily the best hair product I have ever purchased.,"I’m a 40-year-old woman with thick, frizzy, naturally curly hair. Over my lifetime, I have bought more products to tame my hair than I could shake a stick at...so keep that in mind when I say that this is, hands down, the best thing I’ve ever bought for my hair. It tames the frizz without weighing it down and dampening the curl. It has a light baby powder scent and is priced perfectly. I love the Carol’s Daughter brand, but this is, undeniably, the best product of theirs - or anyone’s - that I’ve ever put in my hair. Thank you, Lisa and Margeurite, and please never stop making this stuff!"
17,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Moisturizer,"This doesn’t work well in my hair at all but it is my favorite body lotion ever now!I love the light whipped shea butter it’s so easy to smooth on. Normally my Shea butter creations are like putty but this goes on like frosting!It turned my hair to gross cement when applying to the ends and dry parts, it just made that part gross and sticky like I put a bunch of hair thickening foam or styling agent on. My husband has thicker hair and he really liked it in his hair :-)Either way I recommend."
18,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture and Hair Dress all in one,"Great product for all hair types, especially if you have thicker hair. This product is cream based and doesn’t take much to get the moisture you need. It also doubles as hair dress, leaving your curls and waves slick as if it was dressed with pomade. However, because of its thick nature, you will need to wash your hair regularly to prevent build-up (builds up pretty quickly with daily use). Smells great!"
19,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Merchant Has Doubled The Price - Bad Business,"Love the product. Keeps my hair shiny, healthy, soft and moisturized. Highly recommend this cream - best product Carol’s Daughter makes in my opinion. What I don’t love? The fact that the price went from $7 to $14. I’ve ordered this product 3 times in the past two months -  and the price was consistent. All of a sudden - the price has now jumped to double. Disappointed."
20,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy.  OMG it is so greasy!,Bought this bc it said for extra dry so I used for some flat twists [so a fair amount] and unlike the Coco Creme [same brand] the inside of the twists were still greasy - just sat on the hair...I think it left the outer part only bc I work out and wear hats...Pretty sure I will NOT rebuy this and will stick with what I know...the Coco Creme Cream :)
21,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this cream,I love this hair cream. I have yet to be able to find another one product that can replicate what this does for my 4C hair. It is moisturizing and softens the hair so well. It also defines my curls - but doesn’t have hold so I just use it to 2 strand twist my hair.  I used this to braid my seven yr old’s hair as well and her hair turns out beautiful without overloading it with different products. My mother has also realized this product is great for refreshing her “TWA”. This cream is definitely staying in my hair product rotation permanently.
22,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product loves your hair, & your loves it back.","I have used this brand before, I loved then and even more now, it has a wonderful fragrance,it is light to the touch and makes love to your hair.!!! The jar I purchased was an ample amount, which I am so happy about,but when it's gone I will surely purchase another one...I don't ever intend to be without it.P.S  I have to get one for my husband now  because he tried mine and now he's a fan.."
23,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,NO FRIZZ! Extremely DEFINED TWIST OUT,"I recently changed to this product because my other favorite twisting cream was allowing my hair to frizz up during the summer weather in NYC which is very humid. I have thick, slightly course, dry hair.This cream does not frizz up my hair at all and my twist outs are extremely defined and shiny! My hair looks the same from morning til night during the warm humid weather. I find that I do need to put alot of cream in each section of my hair when I twist it though, but it works, so I don’t mind.The smell isn’t very pleasant, just smells like a natural Shea butter but I got use to it. The smell is very, very mild when it’s in your hair.I LOVE THIS CREAM. BEST TWIST OUT ON MY TYPE 4 HAIR."
24,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,not for me,"pros:-cute packaging-light, fresh smell. not at all fake or cloying - smells sweetly herbal-pleasing texture, a bit like thickened coconut oilcons:-if I apply too little, I see no difference in dryness-if I apply too much, my hair won't dry and stays greasy through two washes-difficult to apply, did not soak into my hair well"
25,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love","Love, love, love this product. Was a little afraid it would be too heavy for my hair, but it moisturizes really well and adds a great sheen, When first put on it feels greasy and heavy but absorbs well..I usually put it on at night and wrap my hair. I highly recommend it. I have texlax hair with tracks. Not heavy for the weave as well. Not a fan of the fragrance but thankfully that disappears after a while. A little goes a long way. Make sure to massage it in well. I will definitely repurchase."
26,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,For ethnic hair.  Left my “non ethnic” hair very greasy,"Soooo...I didn’t research this product enough before buying.  When I used it (as directed) my hair was left extremely greasy.  I generally wash my hair twice a week and this made it look like it had been over a week after I washed and styled it.I did not realize it is primarily for ethnic hair.  I’m sure it works GREAT for the correct hair type.  I love the shampoo, conditioner and spray on leave in conditioner and will likely continue using them."
27,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Yet another disappointment....,"No more hair products for me from Amazon.  Nothing ever is at is described.  Just another waste of heard earned money.  I will not tell anyone to avoid this product because we each have different experiences depending on hair type, but for one wh has baby fine dray hair...not helpful at all."
28,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT for 4c hair,This product is amazing on my 4c hair I love Carol's Daughter products from her shampoo to her conditioning sprays they help manage and grow my 4c hair this item makes my hair easy to comb through and keeps it very well moisturized compare to all other products I have tried on my hair this is the one that works
29,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,It really provides moisture,"I love this product. I used this on my 7 year old biracial daughters very dry hair and it brought it back to life. It really moistures her dry hair. I put it on her hair damp and dry and it provides shine, moisture and it is not a greasy feel. I will be buying this again."
30,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t use,"I didn’t realize this was leave in conditioner. Don’t know if I missed seeing that by not paying attention or if it was obscure information.  I tried to use it as a leave in, used too much, had to rewash my hair.  Eventually I will probably throw away the remaining product."
31,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Would not buy again,"First I can't stand the smell of this product, reminds of cough medicine. The consistency is very hard to work with but I used the whole jar to give it a fair chance. Have not seen any improvement in my hair whatsoever. I tried it as a leave in, a mask, a deep conditioner and using it only on the ends and its awful. Makes my hair stiff and more unmanageable. I have very thick curly hair so anything that makes it more unruly is out of the question. Takes a few shampoos to get it out of my hair as well. I tried but would not use again or recommend but hey everyone is different."
32,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Gotta try this!,I loved that this is the first product of Carol’s daughter that I’ve tried and immediately could see the difference. My hair was soft and manageable! I have very course hair and couldn’t believe how much better it feels. Can’t wait to try the other products!
33,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Adds moisture,I’ve been using this product for years. My hair is very curly and dry as most curly hair is.Margaritte’s Magic adds back moisture. I also massage it into my scalp. A little goes a long way. I use it most every day.
34,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,This stuff is crack to my hair. It smells good and leaves my hair feeling very moisturized. A little goes a long way. Have been using for about a month and my hair feels softer and more moisturized. I love this product.
35,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Healthy crown!,I love the light scent and the lightweight feel of the product. I use it as the Cream in my Liquid Oil Cream routine. Helps my natural style 4c hair stay moist for days.
36,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Too oily and sticky,It’s too oily and sticky for my hairs. I had to wash my hair after I applied and it was still sticky after I washed. I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t have thick hairs but it’s not for me.
37,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Might just be me....,"I’m regifting this product, mainly because I’m now on a loc journey.  However, the scent smells like grandma’s  perfume.  It’s a little drying and not at all what I expected based on YouTube reviews.🤷🏽‍♀️ Sorry...I really wanted to like it."
38,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Just right!!!,"Its my second order of this hairdress, the best on the market, it moisturizes without leaving your hair weighed down and oily..."
39,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Winning product,I am in love with this product. It moisturizes and softens and I just can't keep my hands out of my hair. I use it on my scalp and along the braid to where my hair stops when I have in box braids. This will now definitely be a staple
40,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Purchase this!!!!,"Listen! I was real skeptical about buying this. I wanted something else from the company but it was out of stock so I went with this instead. I really saw a huge difference after using it. I have real dry hair and this made my hair so soft and hydrated. I used it for a protective style. I haven't removed the style as yet, so I I not sure how my hair looks right now. But I can't wait to see."
41,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,I tried this on my hair the other day. It made my hair dry and hard. Yes it brought the curls out but it wasn't what I've expected. Thought it would bring life and sheen to my hair. But instead it did the opposite. The directions said it can be used on wet or dry hair. I washed it out of my hair and tried it while my hair was wet. Still no difference. So I gave it to my son. Hopefully it will work better on his hair
42,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product,"At first, I did not like this product but it might have been because I was not using it in the way my hair liked. I used it to moisturize my braids/twist and it works well. It is very thick and I have to rub it on my hands thoroughly before putting on my hair or it will just chunk on my hair. I have 4c/b low porosity hair. It goes well with other products."
43,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hair care,"My beautician noticed that my hair got thicker and asked was I was using.  Told her I was using this.  My hair has grown and I like the smell too.  My hair is manageable and moisturized.  Don't be shy, give it a try!"
44,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,So Far So Good....,"Finding good products that actually work for African American hair types can be a difficult task.  I've been on the hunt for good hair products that moisturizes, reduce flakes, safe for relaxed/color treated hair, helps breakage, and doesn't weigh your hair down.  I've tried almost everything!!  From Soft Sheen (Anti Breakage/Dandruff), Organic Root Stimulator (Carrot Oil, Coconut Oil, Hair Fertilizer), Sulfur 8, Top Brass, Dr. Miracle, Motions, Castor Oil, etc.  But I was never completely satisfied with either of those products.  They either didn't work, still had flakes, didn't smell too great, or weighed my hair down.Carol's Daughter Marguerite to the RESCUE!!! I LOVE the smell of this hairdress.  This is my 1st time using it and so far my hair feels light, moisturized, and smells GREAT! The price is a little steep for a hairdress but I think it may be worth it.  You don't need to use much so 1 jar could last you a good while.  As I continue to use this product I will update my review if I experience any changes."
45,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisture!,My hair is old and I take prescription drugs. This cream really helps keep my hair moisturized and neat.

47,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for controlling friz,"Love this product.  I have tried others and they never work as well.  At one point I couldn't find this product,  and my hair was a frizzy mess for a few months."
48,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased!,It really moisturized my hair without making it heavy and smells great. I have 4c hair and it works great.
49,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Moisturizes hair, but...","This product does moisturize like it says it does, and it does that very well. But, it leaves my scalp feeling extremely greasy and makes my hair feel heavy. This also didn't help my dry scalp."
50,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Potential,It’s a damn good product on 4c hair! But if only it could be delivered without the contents being busted due to drivers throwing the packages on porch!
51,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy it if you’re expecting it to replace the Healthy Hair Butter,"Disgusting smelling stuff. Why did carols daughter discontinue the other healthy hair butter, only to leave this smelly stuff on the market? Absolutely disgusting!"
52,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not my usual go-to,"I like this well enough. I usually order the healthy hair butter but since it was sold out, I opted to try this as the consistency seemed similar, if not the same. It is a little bit stiffer than the hair butter but is still a good product overall.  Delivery was smooth and fast so I was able to get my hair done on time."

55,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive Product,I am African American and I use this product on my hair daily.  It does not leave my hair feeling oily which is important to me.  It seems to help with styling because I like to curl my hair with a curling iron and this seems to help lessen frizziness and fried ends.  I would recommend.
56,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the price,The price was very reasonable and I used it for my hair. It feels and smells wonderful

I have thick, untreated hair but it gets very dry even though I only wash it once a week. I take a dime sized amount, rub it around in my hands, and then slowly swipe it through the ends and work my way up to my scalp so that it distributes evenly. I've found that I can make sure it is distributed more evenly when my hair is dry. It is easy to use too much and then look a little greasy, but just start small and you'll find the right amount for you.I love the healthy shine that it gives my hair. I reapply after 3 days (so I use it twice in between washings), and it helps tame my wisps and broken hair along my hairline. I also have been putting it in my 3 yro and 1 yro's hair every few days! It gives their hair a little bit of weight so that I can style it easier (also gives it a beautiful shine). It has a delicate smell of shea butter, and it smells slightly different once applied on me and my two daughters. All pleasant! I am such a fan of this product and this tub will last us a long time!"

Tiny bit goes a long way - yes just a little product is good for my hair. I have almost wait length and its thick.2. Smells delicious3. I used it on dry hair and wet hair and it did make my hair smooth and manageableBUT,(con below)1. I couldn't straighten my hair after i applied this - even though the product says you can use this in both wet and dry hair and style anyway we normally would, I wasn't able to straighten my hair after once I applied this cream. My hair turned very oily  and it clumped together. I did this in the morning so i couldn't wash my hair after but if i had time i would have washed my hair because it was not pretty :(It may seem like 1 con vs 3 pros but the con is a big one and so i am sad to say i will not be purchasing this product and wouldn't recommend it if you plan on using a hair straighter,"

It used to be for high quality product and mixed hair this was it (and and Jessie's). However, with the new plethora of choices Carol's Daughter has a higher standard to live up too. It does not consistently do that - and this is a ""it's ok"" but not a stellar product. We use several different products including Shea Moisture, Lush, and Karen's Body Beautiful -- to name a few. This fits somewhere in the middle. It is thick but if you don't get the amount correct it can cause your hair to feel oily vs. feeling moisturized. We don't find that it does much beyond a day - and my daughter washes her hair only 1-2x a week as it is so incredibly dry doing so more frequently leaves her with straw hair. For a mixed 3A/3B hair that looks a lot like pipe cleaners twisted up I'd go with this for more occasional use. Perhaps a 3C/4A type hair would do better with it on the daily.We've used earlier versions of this and they seemed to moisturize better - this was about 3 years ago. This one looks the same but acts different."

I stretch my hair overnight and in the morning my hair is soft and ready to style. The softness lasts all day. I've been natural for almost 3 years and I just ""discovered"" this product.

273,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first experience with any of Marguerite's Magic.  I am black and I have natural 4b and 4c hair.  Basically my hair is course, curly and coily.  It's dry and hard to manage.  I have to have moisturizing and conditioning hair products.  I tried the Carol's Daughter Monoi set and I found it to be extremely drying on my hair.  My hair felt stripped.  I had a hard time doing anything with it even when it was wet.  I also had relaxed hair at the time, so it shouldn't have been hard to comb, but it was so bad that I almost pulled my hair out just by combing it.  My daughter also tried it and had terrible results and she wore her hair natural.  We both had the same experience, so I wasn't sure about Carol's Daughter products.  After I saw the reviews I decided to try this product and I was pleasantly surprised.  It didn't dry my hair.  It actually softened my hair.  I also used it when I twisted my hair.  It was also good for that.  It has a very thick consistency.  You don't need to use a lot of it to get good results.  The scent is nice and not very strong.  I can't think of one thing that I didn't like about this.  I will continue to use this and I would recommend it to anyone that need moisturizing hair cream."
274,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Rich and Creamy Moisture for Over Styled Hair,"I you have really dry this works like magic.  I have tried it on dry hair but thought it was a bit too greasy looking, but using it after shampooing on clean wet under any other product (or alone) leaves hair soft and manageable while reducing the appearance of split ends. I tend to really process my hair, color it, blow dry straighten it, use curling irons, etc which makes it pretty dry and brittle, so this is a nice product for repairing it. You don't have to use very much, I have only short to medium length hair and use about a 1/4 tsp of this product so it lasts a long time.  My one complaint when first purchasing this product was that it was incredibly hard to read the tiny green print on the jar, I had to borrow reading glasses to make out what it said.  Over all I think this is a great product."
275,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed opinion,"I purchased this product several months ago when I was transitioning, i.e. growing out my relaxer.  When I was transitioning, it made my new growth softer and more manageable, and my relaxed hair less dry and more moisturized.  Now that I am fully natural, I have a different opinion.  I have used this product many times, and on both wet, freshly-shampooed and dry hair.  I have used it as a leave-in before applying a styler, and have used it over a styler.  While on initial application, the hair is soft and shiny, these attributes, at least in my experience, are not long-lasting.  I find that by the end of the day, my hair has lost its luster, and feels rather crunchy.  My mother, who is natural, and who presses her hair, really likes this product.  I think, at least for me as an African-American, that this product works better on relaxed hair, or on pressed, natural hair.  So, I don't plan on tossing it; it's much too expensive for that. LOL!  When I press my hair, I will give the product a try.The thing that I find rather peculiar about Carol's Daughter hair care products is this: Lisa Price claims that they are designed for all hair types and textures.  I don't think that this is the case.  I think that some hair types and textures have better success with Carol's Daughter's products than others."
276,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not well suited for my hair or my daughter's,"My daughter and I have essentially the same hair.  It's brown, thick and curly and will frizz up pretty easily.  It generally looks best when the hair clumps together smoothly instead of turning into a bushy mess.  I was hoping this stuff would provide that additional moisture while remaining non-greasy.  Unfortunately, even a small amount just makes our hair look greasy and unwashed.  I also don't find the smell pleasing.My son has straight-wavy blonde hair and looks good when his hair has a little wet look.  For that type of hair, this stuff seems to be good.  However, his hair is so manageable that it's also unnecessary to use any product.I don't really think this is a bad product, but it just doesn't work for me."
277,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have very very dry hair. Unreasonably dry, is how I would really classify it.  I have tried several products for dry hair, but because they are oily, they just make my hair oily initially, then it goes right back to being dry. I found that to be the case with another product that called it self, ""restorative""  What's different about this product is that it's a paste, rather than an oil.  This means that you have to work the product into your hair more throughly then you would an oil.  I found that it made a huge improvement. I looks healthier and more is manageable.  I wish it had a better scent. Will replenish when it runs out."

I've recently went natural, and my natural hair has quite a few textures; I've tried various leave-ins and creams, but nothing has worked well for me. I was apprehensive about how thick the cream is, especially after trying the pantene gold series leave in butter, but this works wonders; my hair went from frizzy to defined curls in the short time I've been using this product. My curls have not been this moisturized or defined for a long time. I use this product along with Chi silk oil and the pantene gold series conditioner, but after trying this product I'm going to switch to Carol's daughter shampoo/conditioners."

I never blow dry,  straighten, or process it any way; my hair is just naturally brittle and dry.Anyways I've been searching forever to find something... And this may be it! Here are the pros and con's:Pros:A tiny bit goes a long way, about 1/2 tsp is enough for all my ends (@ target this is only $12 so its a great value) I predict the 8 oz jar will last around 6 months, maybe more.Makes my hair shiny, smooth, and manageable! Not greasy or limp!My hair is growing again! Hair isn't breaking off as much!Great scent, does not irritate my skin or scalp allergiesReduces # of split endsDoes not discolor my blonde hair like many like products do.Con's:Isn't a permenant fix, the next day I still have to use it again to get the same effectIf youre not careful and add too much it can leave a film on your hair. However, it is easy to figure out how much you need and it won't leave a film unless you really put way too much in."
281,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my natural hair,"I have used this product years ago when it first came out.  I used to use it on my daughter's natural, 4c type hair and on my own locs.  Back then,  I stopped using it because it created a flaky buildup in our hair and did not moisturize as well as I had hoped.  I decided to try it again because I have had success with other Carol's Daughter products.  Unfortunately, I have had the same experience.  I used some on my locs and noticed that within hours, my hair felt crunchy rather than moisturized.  I'm not sure whose hair this is ""magic"" for, but I would say it's likely not best on natural, 4b/c type hair."
282,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,It's thicker than the silicone based products like Frizzease serum (which is what I usually use),"This is a nice-smelling hair dressing. When I first opened it, I forgot it was for hair, and I put some on my face, haha. But, it actually does make my skin feel softer too (I've noticed this about hair conditioners - they often can do double duty as skin softeners or shaving cream). It's thicker than the silicone based products like Frizzease serum (which is what I usually use), but it doesn't seem to make my hair feel greasy, even while it *does* make it feel softer and not as dry and crunchy. My hair gets very dry and crunchy in the winter, so I think this will be a product I will continue to use."
283,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,This works well to help me attain second day curls ...,"This works well to help me attain second day curls. It is a cream, a thick cream, which I only need apply a little of. I apply to my dry hair and rub through my curls, scrunching and fluffing as I go. The first time I used it I used too much and it made my hair look very heavy. It is strongly scented but the scent fades quickly. My daughter, who has 4A curls can apply to her damp hair and achieve a more stretched out curl look. Her hair has incredible shrinkage and this combats that. This is an expensive product but for the amount we use daily I can see it lasting 2 months, maybe more."
284,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Silly me,"I often thought that with the abundance of oil and natural products I was putting on my hair that it was well moisturized, even though some oils would not be dissolved into my hair too well leaving me with an oily face :-/ YIKES! Well anyway, I decided to try CD's Marguerite's Magic after reading all of the reviews and what I thought was moisturized hair truly transformed into something wonderful. After applying to my scalp and ends--Instantly my hair was softer, shinier, and well manageable by allowing me to comb/brush with little to no breakage AND it even softened my new growth tremendously. My main purpose for purchasing this product is because I want to turn up my workout and I sweat heavily on my scalp. We all know that sweat includes salt and salt dries out anything especially hair and I don't want my hair to become a reason for me to not be in the best shape of my life. Tomorrow starts a new workout regime which includes daily running and strengthening, I'll come back to let you all know how or if this product remains ""magical""...so far so great, I'm in love already!!update: So I have been working out more intensely and this product still keeps my hair smooth, moisturized, shiny, and manageable after working out. After I workout my hair is always wet. I just apply a little MM (a little goes a long way) and wrap it up for the moment. Once I begin to get ready for work I unwrap my hair and you would have never thought that I worked out that morning. This is a keeper in my book."

I got some really odd looks from friends when I used it.I'll give it another try when my hair grows out a little, but at this point I think this conditioner is more firepower than I need."

It's longer, down below my shoulders, and quite wavy. So I was excited to see this and give it a try. I've been a fan of Carol's Daughter products for quite a while, though it's been a long time since I actually used any. This, I really like.I put it on damp hair and let my hair air-dry. I get very little frizz, and my hair truly does feel softer than it has in ages. It's very thick, like a paste, and a little bit goes a long way. The only downside, but one that I happily overlook, is the slightly...musty...smell of the product. It's hard to describe, really - it's not *bad*, but it's not fruity fresh, either. However, and Carol's Daughter products tend to be reasonably natural, I'm going to assume that is why. And since my hair really has shown improvement since I started using this, I'm totally OK overlooking the slight odor (which, btw, goes away after the hair is dry).Overall, I definitely like the softness of my hair using this, and the jar I have will last for quite some time. If you have overly-processed hair, then it's worth a try!"
287,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,My first CD product,"**I ended up returning the product because I found better and more cost-effective alternative for myself. But my experiences were still positive; maybe this will help someone.I used this on clean damp hair. I used just a tiny bit, emulsified it between my palms, and smoothed it on a small section of hair, then twisted my hair. I made 20 medium twists.My medium twists came out shiny and healthy looking. If you are making small to medium sized twists/braids, just use a touch per section.The next day my twists were beautiful. Two days later I unraveled to re moisturize and re twist. My hair was shiny, healthy, and fluffy, with a uniform pattern. I used just a touch of creme on each section to moisturize for the day, then twisted back up.A week later on clean hair, I used a lot more product to do 6 large twists (about a quarter size for entire head) on damp hair. My hair responded well and is moisturized, shiny, and soft while twisted up. It's winter here so I don't plan on wearing a twist out until summer, but whenever I take my twists down to remoisturize I like the results.It has a pleasant, light scent. I have a sensitive nose, and it doesn't give me problems. It is VERY thick. A little goes a long way. I think I will only use this the first time I two strand twist my hair, then every other day or more. I would not put it all over your hair every single day.I really like this stuff. The consistency really throws me off, though. I plan to use it for when I twist and to moisturize twists, but it also works well as a normal moisturizer sans twisting. Works great paired with the M. Honey, which I used on my ends only."
288,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Detangler and Great for Natural to Straight Styles,"It's a bit oily, so you have to use it sparingly, but it's a great detangler. I have natural hair and if I want to wear a straight style, I blow dry my hair, then put on a little Marguerite's Magic.  Then, I can comb through my hair and straighten it with a flat iron or curl it. I also use it as a detangler before I wash my hair.  I part my hair in sections, then put this on (heavy), then put conditioner on.  I let it sit overnight or for a hour or so and then I shampoo.  My hair is detangled until my next shampoo.  Caution: when I wear my hair naturally curly and use a curly pudding or some sort of koily creme, I don't use this product at all because my hair can't get curly with it. It's detangled, but it flattens my natural curl pattern.  Other than that, I like the product."

That said, using the right amount will leave hair quite soft, moisturized, and will last for a few days without needing a reapplication. The only thing I don't love about it is the scent--while it's not strong or unpleasant, it's also not all that pleasant either. Recommended for natural, kinky/coily hair."

My hair is relaxed and past my shoulders and this product works for me because it's thick, but a little goes a long way. It coats my hair while its wet and gives it more weight as it dries (which in my opinion is a good thing because throughout my day there are no fly-aways).Again, a little goes a long way because it it pretty dense, but there is a nice smooth creaminess to it which makes it easy to apply. The fragrance is light and I just feel like my hair is protected when I go out into the elements (I live in Michigan and the cold winds can be brutal on hair)."

Instead, it weighs it down.  It makes blonde hair look darker.  The best part of this, and why I gave it an extra star, is what it doesn't contain.  It has no petrolatum, no mineral oil, no parabens, no silicone, no artificial colors.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
296,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have 3B curls and very dry hair.  My water is also hard so I a hard time finding something that will moisturize my curls.  This helped to bring some softness to my curls and added some moisture.  I find it works best if I section off my hair in four parts and apply it followed by a curl enhancer.

305,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Did Not Work Well with My Fine Hair,"Unfortunately this cream is just too much for my fine hair. I hoped it would help with the frizz and split ends but I put a very small amount in and it made it much much longer to blow dry my hair (which I guess may not be a bad thing but is REALLY inconvenient), and worse, it weighed it down making it appear greasy and unwashed. Definitely won't be using it again."

307,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,It's OK!,"I have tried several of CD's products and most have just been OK, or did absolutely nothing special for my hair and even at times seemed like it was making things worse for my hair.  However, there have been a few that I think work and does what it says, and this is 1.  I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and it just seemed to sit on my hair, not absorb. However, S of M M works best in my opinion to smooth down edges and flyaways while adding sheen.  It really works best in my daughters hair (3yrs old) which is naturally curly and delicate.  It holds her flyaways nicely and keeps her hair looking neat with no frizzies. A little goes a long way though, because if too much is used it does tend to be too heavy on the hair and will leave product build up. Try it, it just may work for you."

319,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST HAIR CARE FOR ME!!!,"I'm a woman who is Austrian, Swedish and Black. Growing up my family all tried to do my hair. My black grandma Daisy straightened it like she did my big sisters with natural black hair. Worked for them, my hair fell out. My white mom who did my hair everyday used the best curly hair products available for that time (the 70s). Worked if she everyday for school I had a ponytail or two. (Everyone called me Buffy from Family Affair, the popular tv show at the time.) That was cool! But as I got older I wanted to express myself and my unique spirit. But it presented some real issues as there were no good products for my hair needs. But then the industry FINALLY recognized that BLACK hair was also ETHNIC hair and there was a HUGE market for it. And FINALLY we were blessed with CAROL'S DAUGHTER PRODUCTS!!! AMEN TWO TIMES!!!! SHE MADE US FEEL FREE AND A PART OF A STORY ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES!!! AND, YES, IT MADE US FEEL FREE AND OH SO VERY BEAUTIFUL!!! SO TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT I AM SAYING... PUT YOUR HANDS UP IN THE AIR FOR THIS AMAZING WOMAN AND HER AWESOME ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT!!!"
320,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",4.0 out of 5 stars,A little greasy,I like this product. It smells amazing and really does make my hair soft but it was a little greasy on my hair. I mean I followed the instructions but three days after one use my hair was greasy to the touch. My hair is dry so it gets moisture in the initial use of the cream. I like it at the beginning but am not a fan of the days that follow. I didn't use it on my scalp so I can't tell you how that works. It's still a good product though.

322,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,I think every type African American hair can use this,I'm not a professional hair stylist. But what I can say if your transitioning from relaxer to natural this is the best product to use after washing your hair and maybe just doing a twist or even if you blow dry it your hair is so soft after the fact and it just feels like
323,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",3.0 out of 5 stars,Cheaply made,"Like other Carol's Daughter products the first ingredient is corn oil, and then soybean.

336,"Carol's Daughter Marguerite's Magic Restorative Cream, 8 oz (Packaging May Vary)",5.0 out of 5 stars,I jacked mt hair up... this fixed it,"So, look. I know it was dumb, I do but its quarantine, so who cares? I've dyed and bleached my hair multiple times in my life but this was the dumbest thing I've EVER done. During a little fit on identity crisis and a desire for a rebrand, I bleached my 4b hair -- TWICE in one sitting in preparation for some semi perm dye. Okay, stop right there. I know, I know! I'm paying for it right now. My super defined coils loosened from the first dye but my hair was still dark in some places. So, I bleached it again. I KNOW! My curls went straight like I permed them. I thought nothing of it as I continued to watch Assassination Classroom on Hulu (get into it). The dye didn't even stick. My hair started breaking. My hair turned blue, then green and my little cousin said I looked like Sonic the Hedgehog. I used a permanent box dye I had in my drawer as an emergency use only situation and it left my hair parched. So now I was left with short, broken off strands of hair every time I went to detangle or TOUCH my hair. I usually don't care about hair mistakes but this felt HUGE. I almost cried. I ran to my bathroom and started doing a protein treatment, followed by a coconut oil and banana hair mask, then I slapped some of this proudcut in and my hair felt... nourished. I'm still in the process of repairing my hair but this feels so good and makes my hair feel like its being deepy moisturized and has a protective barrier over it. My hair is soft and feels less dry and brittle, though I still have breakage right now. But I feel like if I keep the protein treatments up, followed by this magic potion, I'll be good in no time. And for all the people clutching their pearls at my mistake, I swore off bleach for good this time cause I obviously can't trust myself."

Was looking for a oil to moisturize my scalp and locs.  I used this product for 3 days and it broke my scalp out.  It smells great but it is very greasy and it caused my scalp to become very irritated and itchy.  I think I had a allergic reaction to the oil.  I stopped using it and my scalp had patches of dry skin and scabs.  I’ve never had my scalp itch so bad.  You can see how red and irritated my scalp was and this was after 3 days of using oil.

I've been using organic oils on my hair for the last year and a half bc I live in Spain and the water over here really is hard for your hair and scalp. I noticed a few months after when moved that I was starting to get dandruff, itchy scalp, and brittle hair. I was freaking out thinking I had head lice one week bc I couldn't itching. My husband was laughing at me of course so I decided to try different shampoos and oil treatments to help. I actually found this product while visiting my mom on vacation 4 months ago at Wal-Mart in cultural hair aisle. I grab it up while my mom was saying it wouldn't work on my hair. Needless to say a week after I bought it it worked wonders for my scalp.  At first I used it once a week for 10 min then I changed it up to twice a week for 30 .....still my scalp was getting flaky so I started reading online about adding heat to scalp for oil treatments for an hour once or twice a week. So now that I'm back in Spain I actually have to use this 2x weekly for an hour with heat and I use need oil hair mask once in between these two treatments. This vanilla hair oil is the only oil that actually gives my hair volume everything else I've tried makes my hair so oily I have to wear it up. The need oil treatments helps balance with the brittle issue locking in the moisture better and relieves my itchy scalp. Hope this helps you guys  and remember when traveling to different countries make sure to carry extra hair treatments....the water isn't like USA."

I wish I could just bathe in it because it smells so good.Edit 6/3/2020 - the formula has changed. The photo on the listing was changed to ""softening hair oil"" but I received ""replenishing hair oil"" which is still different from my previous bottle which reads ""pure hair oil."" I'm not sure why the packaging label differs so much but it's obvious they have been tweaking the formula. I noticed that looking at the ingredients several things have been added that are not updated here. According to curls bot, ingredients are still CG friendly.My hair likes this formula better. I am a 2b/2c wavy that had to really be careful with the old formula to prevent weighing down. I still use a tiny pea size dot but it seems to feel lighter on my hair, and is easier to distribute. My hair feels even softer than before and very moisturized. Many thanks to this brand!"

I have fine hair that I use oil on regularly without any issues as long as I apply on the light side. When  I used this oil I used a quarter, then a penny, then a dime sized amount one per trial. It made my hair look like I hadn't washed it in days. It collected dandruff flakes and generally just left my hair feeling greasy and stringy instead of silky or smooth. I wanted this to work out because the ingredients fall in line with all my stipulations but it just didn't.Good amount of product, smelled kind of like vanilla body spray, so not good but not bad."

Since L'Oreal took control of the company, the unique scents that Carol's Daughter use to carry have been discontinued. So many products I need are made with vanilla that I wonder if the company gets some kind of unbeatable deal on it. Or maybe it's part of their strategy to limit our choices.I won't be buying any more."

She has fine, small curls that sometimes break into waves. Lots of damage from heat tools and chemical processes, especially bleaching and lightening. She first put on damp hair, and was worried that it was too greasy. But as the day progressed, she loved how hydrated, shiny, and manageable her hair was. Her main issue with this oil is that it makes her hair flat and feels heavy. However, it’s not thick like honey, more like between olive and grape seed oil. She’s not crazy about the smell as she loves fresh, flowery scents - but I’m loving it. It’s more on the spicy and woody side. Decent amount of product for the price."

It smells heavenly, it moisturizes my thick, 4c hair and gives it a gorgeous shine. I love it because it doesn't leave my hair smelling like hair grease. I think they changed the formula some, because the scent seems a lot stronger- which I prefer. Its very good for seperating twists, bantu knots, or braid-outs. It does sit on your hair, keepong the moisture locked in."

Great product!,"First i have to say read the directions! It says to apply to hair and let it sit for a few minutes then rinse and shampoo/condition and wash your hair. All the bad reviews are from people just putting it in their hair and leaving it throughout the day. It is meant to be used as a pre-wash!This product absolutely smells amazing!! Im obsessed with vanilla, the smell is really concentrated so from the bottle smells a little candle-like but after you put it in your hair it is pure blisss! And definately adds softness over-time."

About the same price, so pulled the trigger.  I  love this stuff so much - I mix it with conditioner (any kind) for my hair, and I use it all over my body in the shower after I rinse cleanser but right before I shave.  I put it everywhere, even places I don't shave, but I don't need a separate shave gel/lotion.  Rinsing off will still leave a bit on your skin which for me is excellent especially in the winter.  It also is amazing to put on right before I self-tan.  Just a little, not too much, and it almost acts like a primer for my tanning mousse or spray with bronzer."

The scent is gorgeous and I rub the excess oil into my hands and even dab a bit on my neck. It gives my natural curly hair a lift and it looks so healthy.

It smells like the vanilla perfume I got at Claire's when I was 7. It's also quite greasy, and not very moisturizing. It's very disappointing to say the least, because with all the good reviews I expected much better. Will not be buying this line again, nor any of their oils.

Embracing my curls have been a journey, one that has brought a variety of products into my life and daily routine. I loosely follow the curly girl method, and am always happy to find cg approved products to try and was really excited to try this brand as it is new to me. I use this oil two ways. The first is as a weekly oil treatment, the steam of the shower makes the scent stronger and really nice. The second way I use it is off label, I put a small amount in my hand, warm it with my palms and use it to break the gel cast on my hair once my hair is fully dry post shower. I enjoy the vanilla scent and the way it lingers in my hair without competing with the other scents I use. Both ways I use this oil help keep my hair hydrated and my curls soft and ridiculously shiny without weighing my hair down or giving it an oil feel or look. Not every new product I try stays in my routine but this one definitely will be as I'm extremely happy with the results."
181,"Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture and Shine Pure Hair Oil For Dry Hair and Dull Hair, with Calendula, Chamomile and Safflower, Silicone Free Hair Oil, Paraben Free, 4.3 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)",VINE VOICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"(First off, the artificial fragrance in this is a migraine trigger for many people. Just FYI in case you're migraine prone)The first ingredient is corn oil, but corn oil is not ideal for hot oil treatments.The best thing for hot oil treatments is coconut oil. In fact, if you are looking for oils for your hair, and can work with coconut, that's one of the most nourishing things you can use. The challenge with coconut is that it's hard/solid at room temperature (coagulates), so you need to keep it slightly warm, or if it's cold, use it like a wax/balm.For me, my hair gets frizzy along with conditioners, so I add a few drops of essential oils to my shampoo, then massage a few drops into my scalp after my hair is dry. It feels great, makes my scalp and hair look healthy with a nice sheen, and reduces dandruff significantly. It also helps hide grays.That's how I use this vanilla oil - a few drops in my shampoo. But it appears to be 95-99% vegetable oils, which might cosmetically add a shine to your hair, and maybe a little softness and a few nourishing vitamins, but it's not going to do a whole lot. I typically prefer essential oils.The smell is very strong, but fewer than approx 2 drops per application doesn't seem to bother me. Even if you're not migraine prone, I could never imagine using an ounce or two for a hot oil, it's very smelly.If you're looking for nourishing oils, there are a lot of inexpensive options (you only need a few drops): Try coconut oil, Argan oil of Morocco, or Almond oil, all of which can be used straight. For scalp stimulation and hair growth try a few drops of Cedarwood oil (should be mixed with a carrier, like 50/50 Almond oil, and also it's been called a masculine smell, it's going to smell woodsy and a bit musky). Or Chamomile oil will help repair damaged skin (also mix with carrier oil, and it's a subtle flowery smell)."

Smell is to die for!,I FREAKING LOVE THIS OIL! I stopped being a fan of Carol's Daughter many moons ago. She sold her company off and it just was no longer for African American hair. I ordered from that company when they were a little place in Brooklyn and all her items had to be kept refrigerated so I was there at the beginning. But then one time I used a product and it turned my hair into straw. So I stayed away from all of her items. BUT somehow in my all my natural hair product junkie tendencies I decided to give this one a try. This smells SO FREAKING AMAZING! And I love the oil mixture. It doesn't have soybean oil or some other odd mixture. I am HERE for the ingredients. Anytime I place this in my hair it's like people are much closer talking to me just to get a whiff of this scent. I smell it so I know others do as well. The smell isn't overpowering and I just enjoy it. And I am a product junkie and have laid my hands on many products but I have to say this top's it in hair oils.

It made my hair smell so good and the smell lasted through styling and sleeping.  I can even smell this product on my pillow.That said, DO NOT USE a lot of this product at one time or your hair will be a hot mess of dripping oil and limp when dried.  Use the amount stated in the directions on the bottle because they are there for a reason. LOL  I, too, thought I knew better and had to rewash my hair to get some of the oil out because it looked greasy instead of styled.Carols Daughter also helped my split ends as well as the fly away hairs at my temple due to my wearing glasses.All in all, a great styling product that I recommend for extremely dry and frizzy hair.  Fine hair might not work as well.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine"

Judging by what they say, they are using this as a LEAVE IN hair oil! This product isn't meant to be used that way. It is a pre-shampoo treatment that can be used on its own or as a hot oil treatment. You're meant to put this in your hair just before you shampoo it out, or leave it in overnight. But it's not meant to be a styling product! If you have dry, brittle hair, rub this into your hair and scalp and let it sit for at least 30 minutes to an hour, then shampoo it out. It's amazing and will leave your hair soft and healthy!"

I tried Carols Daughter Black Vanilla (love that name) Hair Oil and used it like I do other hair oils. (I do not have a favorite brand in hair oil.) I add a very small amount to gently coat the roots of my hair and leave it on overnight. I do this about once, no more than twice, a week. The next day, shampooing the oil out of my hair is a snap and no residual. I've used the Carols Daughter's brand a few times and, it leaves my hair shiny and manageable.The Black Vanilla, though I love the name, and it has an appealing aroma, it is a bit strong for me. In fact, one night I had a little trouble falling asleep because the smell was so strong in my hair! Other than that, this is good stuff made with all-natural ingredients! If you are looking for a hair oil that will leave your hair shiny and soft, I would recommend Carols Daughter brand."

Massage into scalp and hair; shampoo.One day, my hair seemed particularly dry, so I put two drops into the palms of my hands and applied to my hair without shampooing. It tamed the flyaway hair nicely. I'm not sure if this is the intended application, but for one day only, it worked nicely."

Intoxicating. That's where the good news ends. I found it to leave my hair feeling heavy, oily and crispy. As in, the dryness wasn't mitigated by this oil as it is with others I use, which make it seem normal and healthy when I apply them.I will say that I'm not sure what to think about the ingredients. On the one hand, it's nice that they're simple and relatively natural. On the other hand, corn oil is thick and heavy, and I struggle to feel really taken care of by paying $80 quart for it, even if it does smell really, really nice. I thought about it, and if I loved that way my hair responded to it, I'd be more than happy to do it. But, since it fails that test, it's just high priced, exotic-smelling salad oil, to me. Can't recommend it."

She has gone on for years not moisturizing her natural locks.  She does not chemically treat her hair, she wears her hair natural.  There are a variety of oils for moisturizing, but she loves the smell of this.  I am Caucasian and use this as a hot oil treatment.  I take a small amount and transfer it to a small bottle bottle, cap it, put it in hot water, put the oil on my hair - a little dab will do ya - and wait about three minutes and rinse out.  I have fine wavy hair. I think it makes a fine hot oil treatment, maybe a little too heavy for my hair.  My step daughter really likes it, and we have gone through two bottles in a very short amount of time."

Just a tiny bit goes a long way towards adding shine and manageability to my locks. The scent is very pleasing, but doesn't overwhelm at all due to the small amount of product applied. My hair stays soft and easy to brush when I use this hair oil, I no longer have the need to use typical after shampoo hair conditioners. There is no greasy or waxy build up in my hair when using this oil either, it washes clean with shampoo while still leaving a lasting effect of soft, manageable hair.

I have short, silvery hair (that sounds better than gray) and it does seem to condition my hair in addition to the shine.  Gray hair has a tendency to lose its shine so I've been using different kinds of products to bring the shine back.  I use only a small drop and that's plenty which tells me these 4.3 oz. will last a long time.  That makes the cost only $2.21 an ounce....can hardly buy anything at that price.This does seem to me to do everything the company says  it will and it doesn't contain those ingredients we are told is so bad for us.  I don't even know what all of those named are so I guess I shall keep on living without them.  This product is worth your time and money so you can see for yourself what it does for your specific hair problems/needs.

It smells like white flowers. You can smell the tiare and gardenia quite strongly. It smells like kind of a heavy white flower fragrance to me. Reminds me of BB&W velvet tuberose fragrance. The smell dissipates a bit after drying but it stays pretty strong. I have not used it to heat style yet as I do that very rarely. It is not CG friendly so in combination with the fact that I don’t like the smell, I will drop it from my rotation. It has 3 different dimethicones and a drying alcohol in it. It left my curls a little weighed down but it looked pretty shiny. As a leave in, it dried a little hard but it was able to be scrunched without any flaking or anything.Please hit the button if this info was helpful."
10,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Multi Styling Milk, Lightweight Protective Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil for Dry, Damaged and Breakage Prone Hair To Repair and Protect as You Style, 6.8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this every time I run the straightener or curler through my hair. I have long, fine hair and it's so lifeless that styling is about the only thing I can do to bring the va-va-voom to it. Unfortunately, as a brunette, any time I have damage it shows up on the ends of my hair quite noticeably because of my hair color and the splits.This seems to be working well. I suspect it's the coconut oil in it. It's listed high up on the ingredient list, and it feels soft and silky in my hair. I mist my hair every time I get ready to use a styling tool, but I have also been using this as a general leave in conditioner since the coconut oil makes my hair feel so much nicer when I brush it through my hair. It seems like it gives me a little shine, too.The scent of this reminded me a salon, particularly the purple shimmering lights shampoo. It is a pleasant scent, and doesn't smell heavy like vanilla and lavenders often do. The ingredient list is what I'd call typical. It does have alcohol, but moderation is really key with any hair product.I have noticed less end breakage, and my hair just looks better when using this for styling. It seems like it gives it a little more gloss so it isn't as dry looking. It's also been working nicely for daily use as a moisture provider. I just mist the last couple inches of my hair and brush through. Easy peasy. I'd get this again. The price is comparable to other salon leave-ins.The spritzer on this is excellent. When I opened the bottom, I was worried it was too thick, but it mists wonderfully. The locking mechanism is super simple to use. It has a button to push side to side that visibly says if it's locked or unlocked. It's friendly to use. It's also worth noting this does have petroleum in it, mineral oil, parabens, or any artificial color that may deposit. Coconut oil is ingredient number two, after water so the majority of the product is nourishing oils.Cons: It isn't an issue for me, however consumers should know it has linalool in it and that's likely where most of the scent comes from. Just worth noting if that's an issue for you or you have sensitivity to some smells."
11,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Multi Styling Milk, Lightweight Protective Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil for Dry, Damaged and Breakage Prone Hair To Repair and Protect as You Style, 6.8 fl oz",TOP 500 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,See update at endI haven’t use Carol‘s daughters products in a long time. I was surprised at this leave in conditioner with a spray bottle. It releases a very fine spray of the product. It’s actually works good for my hair. I have very fine 3C curly hair. A lot of times my leave in conditioner weighs down my hair before I can even put the styling product on. The picture is from a wash day and it immediately has more body to it while drying then when I use my regular leave in conditioner. I’m sure my hair will keep growing in body the dryer it gets. The fine mist  also will be better when I use it to touch up the dry ends in the days following the wash day.UPDATE: My hair did not keep getting fluffier day after my wash day. Even just the little bit of spray that I used seemed to weigh down my baby fine hair. The next day it starts clumping together which it only does when there’s too much oil product in it. This is the only change in my routine that I’ve made. I didn’t think that I used a lot of the spray. Only two or three squirts on my hair before my mousse product. I don’t think that this is a good fit for my hair. I think I’ll stick with their other products.

Firstly, it came with the cap trigger on backwards. I had to disassemble abs figure out how to get in on correctly. I assumed this was to stop it from spray leaking in transport, but the spray had a lock so this didn’t make sense. I eventually got the sprayer on correctly, and it BROKE the first time I used it. I was able to figure out how to pump some out and the first thing I noticed was the AWFUL SCENT. It smelled like old lady perfume and gave me an awful headache. Thankfully the smell dissipated, but the spray did nothing for my hair. My hair felt frizzy and unconditioned all day. Very disappointed.."

I’ve heard wonderful things about Carol’s Daughter for curly hair, so I was stoked to try this. But I couldn’t find much I loved about it, unfortunately.As a leave-in conditioner and reparative treatment for curly haired days, it was just OK. First, I tried it by itself, to see what, if anything, it would do to help define curls while it provided whatever conditioning power it was going to. Didn’t do much except weigh my hair down.Next, I tried it as a heat protectant when I straightened my hair. Even less impressed. I actually ended up adding an additional protectant product halfway through running my straightening iron over my hair because I felt like it wasn’t doing enough to protect it. And my ends still looked dry afterward.Maybe I’m just missing something, but this product didn’t live up to the brand’s hype. At least not for me. Very disappointed."

So when I saw this product available on Amazon, I jumped to try it. So glad I did. This leave in conditioner is amazing.It’s a thin consistency spray on conditioner that makes it easy to get good coverage over the length of my hair. The fragrance is my favorite part. I literally can smell it all day, even when I have a scarf over my hair.Using this as a leave-in conditioner, my hair afterwards feels silky, soft and hydrated. Using it as a pre-heat treatment, it leaves my hair smooth and frizz-free. You know how some products leave behind a film on your hair that you can feel every time you touch your hair? Yeah, that doesn’t happen here. My hair feels like my hair, just much MUCH healthier. Super satisfied with how well this leave in conditioner has been working for me. I’m going to have to make room in our budget for it. A+++++++ product!"

This monoi milk formula is wonderful—it’s lightweight but leaves hair hydrated and natural looking.  I keep my hair short and textured—lots of layers that accentuate wavy hair.  This spray form is easy to use and smells great.  End results are soft, manageable hair that feels like it did when I was a younger woman.  For added shine and smoothness, I often include Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength 7 Oil Blend after drying my hair.  It’s a great combination that may not work well for oily heads of hair, but totally rejuvenates my dry strands.  This formula has a strong scent of tiare flowers, Tahitian gardenias and coprah coconut oil, and it lingers after styling.  I especially like the spray cap's unique built-in lock system--makes this bottle perfect for travel."

I used it when my hair was natural and found that it made a big difference in combing it out. It has some slip to it but a good amount of emollient ingredients as well so it's nourishing. I also used it in combing ou my relaxed hair and found that it helps with detangling. There are times that I would apply it before blow drying with a hand dryer and found that it doesn't cause a buildup or residue, which is a plus when you're trying to achieve bounce in your hair. I will say that it's one of those things where a little goes a long way so you don't really need a lot to accomplish the goal. I think it's really versatile in terms of when you can use it so I would say it's really nice to have on hand. It's in a spray bottle but comes out fairly well for a thick creamy substance. The scent is nice but not powerful or overbearing. It's worth the money."

I sprayed some on my hand and rubbed it all over my wet hair after showering. In my opinion the scent was similar to spray-net but it didn't remain and wasn't overpowering. I like the bottle and the spray dispenser. As I was rushing to work that was all I could use it for. I'm very excited to try it again in the weekend and use it as a heat protectant and see how my hair will fare. I'll definitely update my review once I try this multi-styling milk. But so far, yeah as a leave in treatment I'm pretty happy with it. BTW my hair is thick, chemically colored black and kinda damaged (from years of japanese straightening but I've stopped that more than 2 years now)"

Unfortunately, after several uses, it just left me a little blah about it.While the scent was nice and subtle it only seemed to offer minimal extra conditioning for my hair. In addition, I have thin hair and this was just too heavy for it and weighed down my curls which is not what I'm looking for. The final straw was the sprayer broke which leaves no good option to use the rest of the product!I've gone back to what I usually use and my hair is much happier now.

19,"Carol’s Daughter Monoi Multi Styling Milk, Lightweight Protective Leave In Conditioner with Monoi Oil for Dry, Damaged and Breakage Prone Hair To Repair and Protect as You Style, 6.8 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I quite like this leave in conditioner. The light coconut scent is very pleasant, and as it goes on in a fairly fine mist it doesn’t weigh my hair down. I haven’t been using it long enough to know if it has a noticeable strengthening effect, and unfortunately I’m not sure I’ll keep using it regularly enough to learn. Despite the good points this leaves my hair (which is fairly short, as I’m a guy) feeling just a little greasy, and that’s a dealbreaker for me. Even slightly greasy hair hits me like nails down a blackboard, so I can’t see myself using this very much.I’m giving it 4 stars, though, because apart from the residue it looks and smells like a really good product."

A heat protectant and a leave in conditioner all in one - 2fer 1 😆 I'm a fan of Carol's Daughter products. They work wonders in my kids hair (I'm white, their dad is AA, and their hair is all over the place). This one I have been using as a leave in for my daughter. The thing with every Carol's Daughter product I've ever tried is they leave my kids curls looking boing-a-liscious while also making them look soft and healthy (instead of wet and hard as some products do). It's a spray, so I get lots of coverage and get to use less product to do so. This is a wonderful product for curly haired people and people with a little bit of everything going on up top. Carol's Daughter for the win again!"

She can use only this and it holds her coils and makes them look hydrated and healthy. It also does the same if she’s wearing her hair in a pouf, looks really nice. My wife, who is white-- I mention that just because her hair texture is different than our daughter’s and not all products that work for our daughter work out for her hair-- she loves to put it in her ends after styling since her ends are usually really dry and says it's very moisturizing. They both are liking it a lot and say that it smells amazing. The bottle is a good size, nozzle works good and has a lock for the sprayer that also works good."

It lingers for a little while after you use it. I used it for a protective style and my hair smelled wonderful. It mists a little too wide for me but I just ended up spraying it closer to the section of hair I was working with. It definitely helped with detangling and I think made my curls a little tighter. It made my hair a little softer and easier to manage which is always a good thing. Adding to my wash day regimen.

They just end up weighing down my hair too much. But I do like to use them on the areas away from my scalp, especially the ends. This protecting spray smells very nice. It reminds me of the beach. It must be the coconut oil scent. Anyway, I really like it. It adds a nice softness to my hair, making it much more manageable without making it limp. I like that it offers protection against all the heated styling tools I use as well. It is a nice size bottle at almost 7 ounces with a easy to use trigger spray nozzle. This has become my new favorite!"

I've compared this to other top-rated brands (TGIN, Maui, Aunt Jackie) and this product is definitely all hyped when it comes to true kinky 4-type coily hair.Disclaimer: I have color-treated (bleached) 4c hair that's very thick, dry, damaged, and easily turns into a kinky fro.💁🏾‍♀️ ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S FORMULA→ Product's Thickness: Very Thick.→ Product's Creaminess: Creamy like a thick whipped butter.→ Product's Scent: VERY VERY STRONG scent (like Men's cologne)→ Has obvious oil contents: No (more like a serum feel)💁🏾‍♀️ INITIAL APPLICATION / PRODUCT APPLIED ON HAIR:→ Weightiness on Hair Wet: very heavy→ The weightiness of Dried Hair: very heavy, weighs down as if you're hair is drenched in water.→ Stickiness on Hair: very sticky→ Water needed to detangle: Not a detangler, more of a styling product.💁🏾‍♀️ STYLING / APPLICATION:→ Best for dry hair (for styling): Yes, but it makes your hair have a ""wet"" look (but not in a curl defining way)→ Best for wet hair (as a base): Maybe, since it's so heavy (I tried on damp and fully dry hair). I felt like this would work better as a rinse out product.→ A lot of product needed on dry hair: Yes.→ A lot of product needed on wet hair: Yes, on damp hair since it's more of a whipped product than a cream.→ Adds Curl Definition: None.→ Adds Volume: No, weighs it down.→ Moisturizes when dry: No, it leaves hair feeling sticky and heavy.→ Dries down and keeps moisture: No.→ Does product sit on to of hair: Yes, this product feels like it coats the hair (laying on top of it) but the hair never absorbs it.→ Does product soften hair (when dry): No, it just makes it feel like wet hair. It bunches your hair up and doesn't help to separate your curls.💁🏾‍♀️ PRODUCT DUPES AND/OR SIMILARITIES→ This product reminds me of brands like Cantu, creme of nature, dark and lovely, more of the popular drugstore brands targets to WOC. The products that smell really good (and too strong) but don't really work the best for 4c hair.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS→ I would NOT recommend this product for thick, coarse, coily, 4c hair because it weighs it down too much and leaves a sticky residue. This product doesn't feel moisturizing, doesn't add much slip to help with detangling, and it's a product that doesn't absorb well into my 4c hair. This product would be better for other wavy or straighter hair types who can stand the strong scent and desire heavyweight products. I would recommend tgin Miracle RepaiRx Curl Food Daily Moisturizer (link: https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-RepaiRx-Daily-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B07K6TWB9D) for an everyday moisturizer as its simply the best for 4c hair. I hope this detailed review really helps :)"

It felt like glue, sticky, thick and weighed my hair down. I tried it with damp hair & dry hair for a week hoping for a different result but no, I guess it just doesnt work with my hair type."

It is so slippery that the tiniest twirl of your fingers encourages immediate curls! It literally cut my styling time by 1 1/2 hours doing my finger twists. My style held strong for three days before finally getting frizzy, and even then it still didn't look that bad(but I always sleep on silk pillow sheets and that helps alot). Hair is incredibly soft and light. The one thing you'll notice though when you take a shower is that wherever your hair had contact with (shoulders, neck, face) will feel super slippery like soap when washing off. On the positive, it reactivates immediately with water so it's almost like you don't need conditioner when detangling so that's a big plus! This is hands on my new go to leave in/ styling product. Will buy again."

I have what I believe is 4C hair and it has been very difficult to work with. I've attached a picture of my hair before use (2 weeks after last wash) and I may post an after as an update to this review. This conditioner cut my shower time for my wash day down from approximately 4 hours to about 2 and it leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I use it in conjunction with the Marguerite's Magic restorative cream by Carol's Daughter when I do a twist out and they leave my hair manageable and easy to comb through. I think I might be allergic to the Murumuru seed as, when it got in my eyes or nose when washing in the shower, I became hoarse and couldn't stop sneezing for hours the first time but this has worked so well for me I still intend to use it. On my second use I just needed to be careful not to get it on my face and that technique worked wonders. The benefits outweigh this con as long as I'm careful! Unfortunately this will probably prevent me from using their shampoo but I planned to use texture id on recommendation from a youtube influencer anyway once I finish my stock of shea moisturizer shampoo."

If you are looking for a good product for great day 2+ hair this will become dull, frizzy and hard to refresh. Doesn't become flaky or crusty put once the cast is softened it is hard to get the same results on day 2 or more hair without completely rewetting and reapplying fresh product."

BUT it has amazing slip, left my hair super soft, and my curls were defined after using so I can’t complain. I have multiple textures and porosities throughout my hair but my hair is mainly 4a, low porosity. Sometimes products dont work in all textures of my hair but this one worked extremely well! This will definitely be a new staple in my routine."

Like the worst. When people say don’t use too much it’ll make your hair oily .. I just laugh. Not my hair. I can (and do) use straight oil on my hair. Anyway, I use this product instead of conditioner. I can really tell a difference in the  softness of my hair. It feels softer and healthier. I am for sure a returning customer."

You don’t notice all the flakes that develop until you’re wearing a black shirt or lean against something and it looks like it snowed on it. It also does not leave your hair shiny. It creates a dull cast and take a very long time to dry."

Tried this after spraying with leave-in conditioner and dried with a diffuser. Curls looked fine, but it was very crunchy and crispy and my hair felt ridiculously dry. The only thing i loved about it was the scent.Will try again and just let my hair air-dry, maybe it will be better but I personally cannot recommend this product."

I washed my hair and applied it while wet and it just didn’t seem like enough. I had to apply a pretty generous amount for me to be satisfied with it. I have a weird curl pattern that’s between kinky curly and wavy. Lol. My hair is also more on the fine side. Not very thick at all. Yes I told you all my hair is weird. I don’t think I would buy this again although I have loved all of their other products.

I have been buying expensive shampoos, and I must say I like this better. Very comparable to those salon alternatives as far as rich lather and quality, but even better if you have fly away frizzy hair in humid conditions. Usually I have to wash and dry my hair and it looks better the second day after the frizz settles, but with this product I look more like I came from the salon the same day that I wash my hair."

I’ve been using the black vanilla shampoo as well and I love it all. My curls don’t really curl anymore, just wave, but I needed something to give it great hold and shine. This stuff does just that.

I'm very glad I didn't, b/c 2 or 3 shampoos later, the stuff kicked in and my hair started looking great and feeling soft. I am older, so my hair is dryer than it used to be, and its natural wavy/curly structure was starting to lose its oomph. Once this shampoo kicked in, everything came back to normal. I shampoo every other day in the summer and every 3 days in the winter, and this shampoo is now my brand of choice."

I wash, tshirt dry and add moisturizer. Have done this routine for 20+ years.I heard raves about this company. So I decided to try it.This left a nasty flaky film in my hair when it dried. My hair felt gross. It’s normally soft and curly and bouncy. This made me look like I needed a deep oil treatment. I had to check the bottle again to make sure it wasn’t supposed to be rinsed and I bought the wrong product. Nope. It’s a leave-in.Not impressed. I use Cantu, Olive Oil and Lusters with no issues. This was the worst."

Heavy/Moisture Rich. Lasts a while.,Can't go wrong with this product if you're hair is thirsty. It is heavy so this will only work with certain hair types. I use this as a leave in conditioner after I shampoo. By taking a dime size amount or less and distributing it to my curls (but not my scalp) when my hair is already wet. I just squeeze out the excess water and it locks in the moisture. One of these will probably last me 2 years considering how little I need to use since it is so heavy.My curls are fine so I would not recommend using this without diluting it for a leave in conditioner and I would not use this more than once per week as a regular conditioner. But that's just me and my fine curls. They can't take the weight.

I literally had started using the clippers on my hair so it wasn't long enough to curl up. But someone suggested this exact product, and I haven't looked back!

Nothing really special where I felt like I needed it.This one however, is different.  I've ordered it several times and it's the only moisturizing cream I buy.  I've thrown the others out and I stick with this one.  It's thick and helps my twists stay in place until I'm ready to take them out.  It gives softness and moisture to my hair.The scent is a bit strong, but I like it so it doesn't bother me.  I've tried other products, but I keep coming back to this one.  I use this and a small amount of twisting gel (from another company) and that's all I need.I'm taking an effort to stop buying every new product that comes out and just stick to what I know works! This is definitely a staple product for me."

The actual product does Nothing for my hair.  It doesn't make it soft. It flakes off of my hair something fierce. Don't wear anything black!  It makes my hair feel stiff, and dry. Not moisturizing at all.  The smell is not pleasant. There is a bit of a chemical smell.This product may be good for some people, but not my hair type.

I still decided to give it a chance,  maybe I needed to use it a couple days.  However,  by the 3rd day my hair had become so course,  dry and brittle utt felt like straw.  Also, after my hair dried there was a lot of flaking as I combed my hair.  I bought it because it had great reviews from YouTubers.  I guess it's not for everyone.

The product was very thick, but also heavy in a waxy sort of way. I combed it through soaking wet hair and used a little gel around my frizz prone areas. I felt like this really weighed down my curls and didn’t feel soft, but waxy. It was also hard to get nice looking curls beyond wash day. Typically, I can get at least two days of fresh curls after wash day. I will finish this jar, but cancelled my subscribe and save."

The second I opened it, it was a very strong, old spice type smell. Smells very much like a masculine cologne.I still decided to use it, and from what I can tell, without adding any extra products, my hair does feel A LOT softer and seems more moisturized.I don’t think I left it in for the amount of time it says (prob. 5-7 min. because I’ve had some products do weird things with my hair so this was more of a test run) but I can imagine with regular use and leaving it in longer, will keep my hair soft and moisturized. Especially with how great it feels after this first use.Giving it 3 stars because the smell is really disappointing."

This is Not that kind of hair product. It is a rinse out hair mask treatment, like those small one or two time use packs you can get at Sally's only in a big tub for many uses.  I wore it in my hair for a whole day up in a bun and washed it out before bed that night and it made my hair feel So Smooth the next morning.  A necessity for these cold winter months in the Northeastern US. The scent people describe it as overwhelming but I don't think so... It isn't a girly smell. More like a light musky smell.  I really didn't mind it and I wore it in my hair all day just to ensure it thoroughly penetrated my hair and left it nice and hydrated."

The Laser Ship guy rung the door bell four times by the way. I wish Amazon would stop using Laser Ship. Anyways, it arrived very cold. When I first opened it, it was very thick and not creamy at all, but I used it anyway because I figured that was just because it was cold. I was wrong, it made me hair very flaky. I used it with my Ecostyler like I usually do. This is new to me because I’ve purchased this Coco Creme twice and that’s never happened. In the pictures, you can see my old one is very creamy from the little bit that you can see lol and this one is just thick and not creamy at all.

I know that my hair is dense, meaning I have a lot of individual hairs on my head.  I think that my hair strands are rather fine.  So I am trying to let it grow longer.  I can wear it naturally short but it's more difficult to manage as it's growing out.  It's true that the whiteness does disappear, so don't worry about that.  It feels good on my hair."

I have thick curly hair and have spent anywhere between 2$ and 50$ Trying to find the perfect Shampoo / conditioner. I picked this up randomly one day and I fell in love. Never again will i use anything else. I’m from queens so I liked they were from Brooklyn. They really create their products carefully and successfully around people with hair like mine. My hair has never felt or looked so healthy. It’s shiny, my curls are more defined, and it feels so soft. I began to use thier other hair products, only adding to glam factor  ❤️ The smell alone was enough for me to buy it haha. I highly recommend! I never write reviews but I had to!"

This product did provide some moisture but the chemical smell with the addition of coconut to try I guess to mask the chemical  scent was overwhelming.

However, SheaMoisture has apparently changed the formulation of this product as the last three containers I purchased were watery and sat on my hair in a drippy, white scum -- it no longer melted into my hair or gave defined curls.  I saw an advertisement for Carol's Daughter Coco Crème Curl Enhancing Moisture Butter and decided to try it.  I love it!  It smells good, a little goes a long way and it melts into my hair, makes it shiny and delivers defined curls.  This is my new go-to hair product.

I take a small dollop and rub it all over my hands and then threw her wet brushed hair. If I’m low on time I quickly scrunch it and call it a day.

I've used this products 3 times now and today it did the same thing again. Clumps! Clumps of hair coming off of my head from roots to end once I put the Coco Creme Curl Quenching Conditioner on. WHAT is in this product? You put that stuff on and my hair clumps immediately instead of making easy to untangle. Once the damage is done, it just comes out. No comb, no pull. Just running water and clumps come down!!!! It's almost like it has a relaxer in it or something. Plus, it feels super heavy like it has fats or petroleum in it. I was just reading the ingredients and it also has alcohol in it. I'm so disappointed and sad. I wanted to love this thing but clearly Loreal has done something with this. I wish I could get my hair back! Three times it has done the same thing and I'm only now catching on. I'm angry and sad. I even bought it straight from the company's website thinking it would guarantee quality. I don't even know what to say. I wish they would take that product off the shelves and websites. I wish I had found all of the other reviews where people were saying the same thing. I honestly wish I had bought it from Amazon instead of their website. At least I would have seen the negative reviews. My heart aches."

I think it's important to say that because I have tried tons of products based on other people's experiences and many of them haven't worked for my hair. All that being said, I love this cream gel and it's become a holy grail product for me.ABOUT MY HAIRMy hair is 2b/2c and very long. It's fine and naturally blonde. I usually follow CGM and according to curlsbot this is CG approved.WHAT I LIKEI can use this product at my roots (sparingly) and it doesn't make my fine blonde hair look dirty. That's pretty rare to be honest.It spreads well and has slip (it's kind of slimy) so I can get it into my hair without using gobs of it.It doesn't give a cast. Historically I have preferred gels that give a cast because they usually end up with more defined curls for me. This one doesn't seem to do that but I still end up with pretty defined curls that are actually soft. It's also nice that I don't have to break the cast later in the day. It also doesn't seem to weigh down my hair too bad (more than it already is - it's at my belly button right now). I look forward to cutting my hair and seeing how it does with the shorter length.I use it while my hair is damp as my last product. It's not overly moisturizing so if your hair needs a lot of moisture you'll probably still want to use a leave-in prior but it does a better job of not drying out my hair than other gels (even CG gels) have done."

When it arrived in a plastic shipping envelope, it was dripping out everywhere. The product coated the entire inside of the envelope. It was a huge mess. When I pulled the tub out, I noticed that there was no trace of any kind of safety seal. This is a decision the manufacturer made, with disastrous effects. Product everywhere. In the name of a thorough review, though, I scraped most of it back into the tub. Then I cleaned up, because that stuff was all over the place.So, here's the thing. After all that, this product was just OK in my hair. It didn't give me the kind of definition I was hoping for. There were lots of slightly crusty pieces, and some that clearly didn't get hardly any product. And it was pretty fuzzy and dry overall. I didn't change anything else about my routine, so I was a bit surprised at this result. I add product to my hair in sections when it's soaking wet. Then I brush it through, add more water and separate out clumps before diffusing upside down. This method is pretty foolproof for me...until now.I mean...it's not terrible. But it's not great, either. And I don't like how my hair feels with this product in it. It feels slightly crusty and dry. Given that this product says it works well for dry hair, I can't quite wrap my brain around how it seemed to make my hair more dry.Based on the product itself, I would probably give this 3.5 stars. But factor in the huge mess I had to deal with because the tub wasn't manufactured with a safety seal? Solid 3. I would not buy this again."
623,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist, with Coconut Water, Silicone Free Curl Refresher Spray, Paraben Free Curl Activating Mist for Very Dry, Curly To Coily Hair, 5, 8.4 Fl Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,"Carol's Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist is perfect for my waves and curls.  First, I love the way it dispenses.  Simply press the nozzle and it dispenses a long. lightweight mist that sufficiently covers all hair evenly.  That's all it takes...one press of the nozzle covers my thick, shoulder length hair.  When I use the spray after washing and towel drying my hair, it eliminates frizz, keeping my curls and waves smooth and in place.  I almost always wash my hair daily but when I skip a day, I simply spray my hair with this mist and it revives and refreshes my curls.  This does NOT weigh my hair down, nor does it make my hair look or feel oily or greasy.  It dries quickly as well.  The scent is heavenly! I LOVE the scent of this mist. I'm normally not a fan of citrusy scents but I LOVE the scent of this mist. Its SO light and refreshing.  A woman at the grocery store told me my hair smelled good as we were waiting in line...and she was 6 feet behind me, following social distancing guidelines.I love Carol's Daughter Coco Cream Perfecting Water Coco Mist and what it does for my hair. I love it SO much, I'm signed up for Amazon's 'subscribe and save' plan to have it delivered monthly.  I AM continuing to use and purchase it and I absolutely recommend it!"
624,"Carol’s Daughter Coco Creme Curl Perfecting Water Coco Mist, with Coconut Water, Silicone Free Curl Refresher Spray, Paraben Free Curl Activating Mist for Very Dry, Curly To Coily Hair, 5, 8.4 Fl Oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am reviewing three “Carol’s Daughter” products at once  as mentioned below. They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

Clumps coming out,"First I just found out Carol’s daughter was bought out by L’Oréal several years ago. These products have caused me extreme hair loss I’m talking coming out in clumps after clumps after clumps... there needs to be a class action suit against this company! When you first put it on it’s seems moisturizing, but once it starts drying my hair feels like hay snd it has been impossible to get my natural texture back let alone all the hair loss. I’m wondering if L’Oréal has done something to the product ingredients  from the original formula. I don’t understand how anyone is having a positive experience with these products."

It does take some scrunchy to get the desired curl effect and I noticed it doesn't fully help with frizz.  My hair is particularly dry though, so I wonder if that has something to do with it.  I don't notice any weighing down of my hair when I use the product which is really nice considering I don't wash it every day due to excessive drying.I LOVE that it is free of harsh chemicals since I've recently switched to no parabens or sulfates and it is sometimes difficult to find products that are free of chemicals while still giving you what you need."

But it is also very fine, which means it tangles easily.  I need a conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down, which is not so easy to find.The first thing I noticed about this conditioner was the fragrance.  It definitely has a strong coconut scent, and I found that the scent lingers.  Personally, I like the fragrance and enjoy catching whiffs of it throughout the day, but if you are not someone who enjoys scented products this would NOT be the right choice for you.  The second thing I noticed was that this conditioner was not as thick as I expected.  Although it does have a nice consistency, I was worried that it might not provide sufficient conditioning.  Otherwise, it was easy to use, including rinsing easily from my hair.I comb through my hair while still wet, and I found that I could do this comfortably after using this conditioner.  After drying my hair, it felt soft without being limp.  So far, I have been very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."

I only wash my hair once every week or so and don’t even bother with regular conditioner but just a mask after washing.  This one has worked really well for me and I’ve used a lot of them over the years that cover the range in price/quality.  The smell is ok and didn’t linger which is good because I’ve disliked some Carols Daughter product scents in the past.I noticed some increased softness but particularly noticed increased manageability. I blow out my hair and the brush was gliding easily.  Minimal breakage.I have also used this to detangle my two girls’ curly hair.  They get large knots and I spray them with water then apply some of this to loosen it up to comb.  It works well to detangle and I can leave it in without their hair being too greasy after."

I currently use shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner from Carol’s Daughter and LOVE them! This curl gel works just as good as the other products and helps to hold my curls nicely without leaving them hard and crunchy. It holds all day and holds throughout the following day with a quick spritz of water. It doesn’t leave my hair sticky or with the feeling of built up product. I highly recommend!For reference, I have lower back length, natural 3b/c biracial (black and Latina) hair and this works great! It fits beautifully into the “LOC” method routine. I highly recommend to other naturalistas!"

I tried it alone on my wavy curls, and it did feel very moisturizing and provided a lot of slip. The result was definitely more tamed frizz than no-styler curls, but it didn't give me enough grit or hold that my curls like. It did help with clump forming and frizz taming, but not with stiffness or hold, so don't expect to get a strong cast with this. My clumps eventually fell apart because my hair was too soft. The next time, I paired it with a glaze-over of a hard hold gel on top, and I got much better results.This description of my results goes right along with the ingredient list - it includes polyquaternium-4 which is an anti-humidity/anti-frizz ingredient, and doesn't contain any ingredients high in protein, but DOES include a lot of ingredients for moisture, like oils, butters, and glycerin. These type of ingredients will ROCK some curls and make them look so good, but others (like mine) need more protein-heavy ingredients. But again, I still got great results by adding a protein-heavy harder hold gel on top.This would be a great product as a single styler for wavies or curlies who like really soft curls and like to skip a cast, and great for those who's hair loves more moisture than protein."

It smells great and holds well. The cast is very easy to break up and it doesnt flake regardless of whAt hair spray i use.My issue was the jar I guess wasnt closed properly. So it opened during shipment. The package wasnt wet on the outside or anything. So when I opened it the mailer, some of it splattered on my great work shirt. That was a bummer. It didnt stain my shirt, but it sure did suck having to tum nack uppatairs having to change at the last minute causing me to be almost late.I do really enjoy this product. It smells clean and floraly and it does what it claims. If you get an unwanted crunchyness just gently scrunch the dried hair in your palm, it breaks up easily while still maintaining the hold.About a quarters worth was lost, as I immediately tossed the whole thing in the trash can as i was in a hurry and at that point , upset. My daughter pulled it out and salvaged what she could.I would recommend that the seller put at LEAST A MINI seal just to hopefully avoid those problems in the future. It splattered on my rib area right where someone would carry a baby on their hip.I truly do like the product, the packaging and sloppily closed jar doesnt sit well with me."

So I looked at the ingredients, and it has beeswax now I have never used a product with it before, but I believe it's what is making my hair so Dry. buildup can make hair dry, so I think it has built up on my hair I will try washing my hair more and see if that fixes the problem, but if it doesn't my 2/5 stars stays.Update: I tried washing my hair more, And that did help but this product is so confusing with my hair. I used it with oil before I applied the cream, and it doesn't seem to do well with oil in my experience. (But you know everybody's hair is different.) When I leave out the oil it works okay, helps curl my 3a type hair along with a light gel and leave-in, but never apply this cream without a leave-in or at least on damp hair because it will be a whole sticky mess. I have a quarter left of product in the jar and, Idk if I will repurchase. However, I will give it another star because it made my hair very beautiful when it worked."

Although they claim to be an extremely ""natural"" non toxic company, the ingredients do contain artificial fragrance.  So unfortunately I can't use it.  However, I did try it and the scent is very nice and fresh.  I like the way it smells (just don't like the toxic chemical that makes that smell).  If you aren't sensitive to smells, you'll probably enjoy the clean scent!As far as the product itself, it does help refresh my curls a little, but it's nothing life changing.  My curls are slightly less frizzy.  I like that it doesn't leave them sticky or crunchy. However, I do wish it helped a little more with the curl.Overall, it seems to be a decent product, but for me, it doesn't add enough curl power and because of the artificial fragrance, I won't be using it."

The mist is very fine, and admittedly I did get some on my eye accidentally- Yet it didn't sting. The mist also shined my hair. It's especially effective on my ends.It's a very subtle floral coco scent on my hair, which is pleasant for me. The brown cap is hard to open and put back, so I'd recommend simply throwing it away since it only protects the spray nozzle form being accidentally pressed, even though it takes a good finger press to release the mist. Also, the plastic container is durable enough not to break when dropped on a hard floor.I'd totally recommend this if you want a quick solution to revive your dry, frizzy hair. This is an effective and quick alternative to styling creams, which are heavier."

It doesn’t feel “heavy” on my hair and I’ve been playing in my hair practically all day and my curls are still defined.The only issue I had has nothing to do with the product itself, but the way it was delivered.

The pump is also fantastic, making it easy to measure out what I use, while minimizing spillage. I also find with this conditioner, you don't need as much as usualy, and for curly haired people, you typically need a lot of conditioner..As always with Carol's Daughter, there are no parabens, and it's cruelty free.The coconut smell is strong though. It stays in my hair all day, which interferes with my perfume, and I don't really love the smell enough to appreciate the interference. It also reacts strangely with my hair, leaving it feeling moisturized, sure, but also weighed down and straggly looking, especially as the week goes on. I think this would be better for people with extremely curly/ thick hair, as mine is probably just too thin. The Monoi works much better for me, and is also a Carol's Daughter product. Despite not loving this particular line, I will continue to sing their praises, because this company really is awesome."

They work great together, and they work great in their own right.  I have reviewed this brand positively in the past, but I am more sold on it now.  For some reason the resulting hair texture is more moist, the hair more strong, lustrous, and the smell very nice. Also, because of the use of these products on my hair, when it is still wet in the warm weather from Southern California Desert conditions, I do not get the immediate drying out nearest the scalp area, particularly with my regrowth. When that drying occurs the resulting style attempt yields dry and brittle frizz. I do pride myself on having hair color processes done that are rendered correctly, and they cost an arm and a leg. So why would I sabotage that? I won’t. I can’t wait to see how my hair will respond after I get my color touch up to see how much better this will look :-).  Since I have very fine here, I want to note that I am not using these moisturizing products on my roots. Everything but my roots, because my hair is fine and thin, and moisturizing  hair products will weigh it down.*To get the most out of this system I am using a minimum amount with great results.  My hair is fine, dry, thin, and I do not treat the roots area.1. Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner (Intense Moisture & Softness System).2. Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask (Intense Moisture & Softness System).3. Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture Butter (Intense Moisture & Softness System).(1) This Coco Creme Creamy Conditioner goes on quite silky and smooth.  I don’t feel as through I need much to get the effect I want.  I used it on hair that is losing the benefits of color treatment, meaning that it is more unmanageable, and I had been using an inexpensive conditioner for a few days, because I had run out of my “good stuff”. In other words, my hair is quite a bit more improved on the first try with this, because I desperately need moisture. I hardly miss the other “good stuff”.  I noticed a bit of weight in my hair, and I realize now that I need to rinse fully, because this product is quite effective.  Also, I am using less..(2) This Coco Creme Velvet Cream Hair Mask was used on my hair on the second or third day after I had been using the prior product.  I was concerned that it would be ”overkill” to put an additional conditioner on, but the conditioner bottle said to do it.  The addition of this didn’t weigh down my hair, especially because it was not applied to my roots, as per my hairdresser.  One thing that threw me off is the lack of instructions on this one jar, so I left it in for five minutes, and then I rinsed well.  I am crazy about this product.  My hair is bouncy, smooth, manageable. So far I am using two products at this point.(3) This Coco Creme Coil Enhancing Moisture butter is making a huge difference, so I will be purchasing it when I run out, if lets say I only have one choice out of three, if I am short on cash.  Together, all three though, is quite a luxury. When I added this product to the mix I am loving it.  Today, I let my hair curl a bit, and blow-dried it partially. Then I watched it again and just blowdried it after putting only a bit through my hair, and not on my roots. I blew my hair dry this time.  The body is quite nice, and this product reminds me of one that the stores stopped selling, and which made my blow-drys quite nice; tangle-free, and lustrous, with moisture.  Again I had thought perhaps all three products at once would be “overkill”, and that my super fine and thin hair would be weighed down.  Not so. My hair looks pretty, because my husband said so when I asked, and it feels nice to me.Again, I love the scent.  Coconut is my favorite.  I am pleased.  Close soap, I’d advise using very little of these products if you have fine and thin hair. I love the result.Enjoy."

I live in the desert, so having that extra kick of moisture is a good way to make sure that my hair stays healthy.  I don't usually like oils, so the masks are thicker and honestly make me feel better about how my hair turns out.  I love the scent of this mask.  It doesn't give you clear directions, but if you take about a nickel size it will cover medium length hair, which means that you will be able to use this for several months.  For that, it is extremely affordable, even though I don't think the extra moisture boost lasts as long as some other masks.  I still prefer the hair mask by Verb, but this one smells a lot better and is more cost effective in the long run even if you have to use it more often."

Sulfate-free shampoos are less harsh but also usually create a significantly lower level of suds which can encourage the user to pump out more shampoo to try to replicate the usual abundance of lather.  At the least this wastes product, but that is not a problem with this shampoo.I have lots of long, curly hair but the texture is thin so it frizzes around my face and tangles easily but because it is easily weighed down I rarely use conditioners. But, the Coco Creme moisturizing shampoo provides just enough hydration without flattening my hair. Also, the pump mechanism is excellent. It is not a pop-up, instead it locks and unlocks. To operate just turn clockwise to open or counterclockwise to close.  Excellent."

I get highlights every 5-6 months, and I never use heat on my hair- not even a diffuser. I was 23 when I ditched my flat iron completely. The last 5 years have been spent on trial and error with every brand and product for curly hair imaginable.I had been researching for a new curl shampoo to use for about a month, carefully combing through reviews, customer pictures, and taking all the nuances of my own hair and each product into account. I found ""coco cream"" shampoo and read through the reviews here on amazon. It seemed that people raved about this product. I also loved the fact that it was a lightweight ""cream,"" instead of an actual lather/detergent/cleanser. I live at the beach, there's always humidity, and I constantly fight frizz. This product was labeled ""ultra hydrating,"" which sounded perfect. My hair is a good mix of kind-of-coarse and not-so-coarse.This shampoo STRIPS MY HAIR unlike anything else I've experienced. Like WORSE THAN PURPLE SHAMPOO (anyone who's used purple shampoo will understand). We have highly calcified water where I live, and I'm almost wondering if a chemical in the shampoo is literally reacting with my water. It dries my hair to the point that I massage it in, immediately & thoroughly wash it out, either put an ultra moisturizing conditioner or mask on, let conditioner/mask sit for a few minutes, and can't comb through my hair. I've literally never experienced this before. I've tried many products in combo with it, let conditioners sit for ridiculous amounts of time, and nothing makes it better. When I get out of the shower, my hair is a dried out, extremely tangled, disgusting mess. It feels awful to touch. The only way I've been able to style it is with LOADS of leave in conditioner, that I very carefully comb it out with, one section at a time.When I came back online to see if others shared a similar experience, most of the only reviews I could find were for the coco creme styling products, and nothing specified towards the shampoo. I'm confused why amazon would create this sort of dilemma in their product review section. I definitely feel mislead by this product and the way it is being marketed."

It is a product suited for thicker and more frizzy hair for sure (I have thin, straight hair). I did like the results as it works as a good moisturizing conditioner, yet the smell of the product permeated for days, it has an intoxicating sweet aroma that was not agreeing with my sense of smell after a while. Also, because of its fatty consistency, if it falls on shower floor, the floor becomes very slippery and the layer stays a while. Had to make sure to wipe off with cleaning solution so I wouldn't slip during my next shower"

I really like this company. I love that their products, like this one, has NO silicones, parabens, petroleum, mineral oil or artificial colors.  I find the fragrance of this one to be light and refreshing overall. Not overpowering for a man and I believe lots of women will also enjoy it.  Scent last for a little while afterwards but again not overpowering.  I use this product on both my hair and my beard. Worked well on both leaving them softer then normal.  Pump bottle that it comes in works very well. Easy to use and looks good in the shower.  I actually like this new bottle / pump design better than some of the other Carols daughter products that I have received In the past.  I honestly have received and reviewed many different shampoo and conditioner products from different companies. Carols daughter is one of my favorite. This is a company I would buy from again."

I've used other products from Carol's Daughter before and they have been, across the board good quality products, but this hair mask doesn't do anything that some of their other more standard conditioners already do, better.The consistency of this hair mask is pretty thick, the smell is good and not overpowering, but it's a much bigger investment of time leaving it in your hair and waiting, vs the much easier leave-in conditioner or the much more traditional rinse and go."

First I want to mention that it is a heavy product. In the winter my hair doesn’t do well with thicker conditioner but it is just what my curls wanted for the summer. It comes in an easy to dispense pump and because it is thicker I use just a bit as opposed to my general handful to condition. I do this before and after I cowash with a thinner conditioner and my hair is easy to detangles and get through with my fingers. The smell is creamy, maybe slightly coconut but mostly neutral. It washes out cleanly, I did attempt to use it as leave in but it was a bit much for me. Overall if you are in need of deep hydration because of the season or just in general I definitely recommend trying this conditioner."

I hate, however, shampoos that leave a filmy, soapy feeling even after rinsing - and conditioners tend to be the worst offenders, so I don't use them at all.  I am very pleased with this Coco shampoo's wonderful conditioning that comes without any residue.  It has a warm pleasant coconut fragrance that isn't overpowering but leaves a hint of aroma after use.  It's quite thick going on, and produces a rich lather as you work it in - and a little bit goes a long way.  It leaves my fine hair noticeably fuller and softer, and less prone to static.  For this fine-haired user, this shampoo works really well: nice fragrance, rich application, rinses clean, and leaves hair visibly fuller and very manageable."

This conditioner also makes your hair smell absolutely heavenly.Though it is recommended to use the deep conditioner along with Carol’s Daughter shampoo and conditioner, I only used this deep conditioner with my normal brand. I like to use this once a week as a mask. I apply liberally and twist my hair up with a clip. Then I cover with a shower cup and relax in the tub for at least thirty minutes. I feel like letting it really soak in with the benefit of the heat from your scalp (hence the cap) takes this conditioner to the next level."

The conditioner left my hair soft and hydrated, plus the scent lasted well over the next day. The conditioner had good slip and worked well with Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla shampoo.

It has a subtle coconut aroma, which I think is nice because while I like the smell of coconut, I don't want it to be very strong.  It does seem to leave my hair conditioned, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.While I think that this is a decent product, I prefer and recommend trying their Rhassoul Clay variety.

Very llite and pleasant fragrance.  The richness of the shampoo struck me as most shampoo has a different viscosity and feel.  I decided that I would Not apply a heavier conditioner, as I did the first time [the accompanying conditioner], as it left my hair feeling lame and over processed with residual.  It didn’t irritate my scalp, which I am rather sensitive.  Nice shampoo with a ‘rich’ feel, but go light on the conditi7if you use one."

It is a strong coconut scent that lingers throughout the day.  Even late in the afternoon, I can still smell it on my hair and it makes me smile.  This may be a turnoff for others because it is very strong, but it works for me.  It also doesn't weight down my hair and has enough moisture to get me through the day in my dry climate.  I wish it helped volumize while moisturizing,but I can't have it all."

It does contain coconut oil, milk, murumuru and mango butters, which hydrate and nourish the hair. It has a light and refreshing coconut scent.

It is fairly priced for an excellent, concentrated shampoo.I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."

I have 4C hair, and there are so many products that promise to be compatible that aren't, all they do is dry you hair out, and sit on top of it making it gritty and harder to manage. I have low porosity hair, and most products just don't work for me. I typically use this cream first, then add about a tablespoon of the Carol’s Daughter Goddess Strength Scalp Oil and Hair Oil Deep Treatment with Castor Oil, 7 Oil Blend and Black Seed Oil, for Weak, Breakage Prone Hair, Hair Oil for Natural Hair, massage it in, and my hair is soft, and clearly moisturized."

The moisture was disappointing especially since this product is supposed to be for very dry hair; It was just ok. Overall I will not be purchasing it again for my daughter but MAY buy it for myself. If you have 4c hair save your money!

I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is conditioner is amazing for my hair. It adds so much slip and moisture to make detangling easy. It also, surprisingly, adds so much definition to my curls. I also love this scent but sometimes it’s a little overbearing. Overall, amazing conditioner and I would 1000% recommend if you have dry hair like me."

Most cremes are not strong enough to hold the curl and gels are too stiff and flaky and drying. This is perfect. I agree with other reviews that the scent is a bit strong and smells like mens cologne but I don’t hate it and it fades over time. I put it on damp hair in 4-5 sections and twist each section and then wrap around my finger and then shake my hair out. I usually wash my hair every other day and to reactivate I spray my hair down a bit and reapply some of the product. I understand that everyone’s hair is different and what may work for me may not for you but I’d definitely give this a try!

0,"Carol's Daughter Goddess Strength Leave-In Conditioner Spray For Curly, Natural Hair, Moisturizing Heat Protectant with Castor Oil, 11 fl oz",4.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing,I must honestly say that the Carol's Daughter Godess Strength line is one of my absolute favorite products to use on my natural 3c4a curls. It leaves my hair soft and moisturized. However this leave in has a very strong scent. I was so taken aback especially since one of the ingredients is black seed oil and the rest of the products have a more pleasant smell.I know black seed oil has a very distinctive smell so this will definitely not keep me from using this leave-in as I feel the pros far outweigh the con.

I sprayed about 50 pumps and did my ends with another 5 pumps and used a heat brush to dry my hair. It is a fine mist so it isn't a lot of product.  It was like I just came out of the salon!

0,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Aloe, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,I will start by say I love Carols Daughter products. I like to use gel and mousse on my natural curls to get the to be more defined. This gel to foam styler is basically a 2 in 1 gel and mousse but turns the gel into mousse if that makes sense. The bottle is a pretty nice size and a little of the product goes a long way which is great.  The gel/ mousse has aloe in it and smells really good and has a light scent. The product is fast drying which is a huge plus because your hair is not wet for hours. You can literally style and by the time you leave the house it’s dry. Definitely recommend for girls with kinks and curls.

I use a similar item from a different company, so I was thrilled to try this.  It is a gel and when it was in my hands it felt a bit soapy - it kinds felt soapy in my hair but yes, it's gel, so it took some maneuvering to get the correct amount.  I also, dislike the smell.  It was fresh smelling , but overpowering for me.  By the 3rd day with this, the pump started sticking so that I had to lift it every time I wanted to pump.  sooooooo..... this didn't work for us."

We have tried so many other products and this one by far is our favorite! She wants to wear her natural but we weren’t able to find a product that was able to tame her curls.

This product actually elongated her beautiful curls and it smells great too!

My daughters long curly hair also looks wonderful with this gel but it didn't last as long. Still though it left my daughters hair looking so good with a perfect curl pattern just..poppin!"

6,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Aloe, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,My short swavy curly hair loves this gel to foam. I usually use a cream for moisture then gel over that for hold. Applied on towel dried hair it gives moisture and a soft hold. Once diffused dry or air dried and fluffed up a bit it’s perfect. I’m not a huge fan of the scent but it doesn’t linger.
7,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Aloe, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,1.0 out of 5 stars,This stinks. It smells like bitter cucumber (or bitter melon if you know what those are) and I couldn't stand it enough to put more in my hair... Also it did not fade much either.

It gives my wavy hair a natural looking bounce without feeling crunchy, dry, powdery or oily. It just looks like my hair but better, and it's so easy to use! No frizz or tangles when I use this product - just an effortless good hair day, every time. It only takes a few minutes to brush it through my hair with my fingers, so it's convenient for wash day or every day!

1,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Cream Serum Moisturizer for Curly Hair, Anti-Frizz, Made with Rose Water and Glycerin, 6.8 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the cleansing products from this brand, but the stylers tend to be too heavy for my fine but thick, 2C/3A curly/wavy hair. This is a much lighter option that controlled my frizz, defined my waves, and left my hair soft without weighing it down. It's not perfect--my hair is pretty dry, and my ends still needed additional moisture--but it's very good. I'm not keen on the rose scent...it reminds me of my friend's elderly grandmother... but it's fairly light and not really noticeable unless I run my fingers through my hair. I did still use a bit of shine serum/sealer on my split ends because they felt a bit crispy, but I'm overdue for a cut anyway. The rest of my hair felt and moved well after using this, and air-dried to a lovely pattern without sticking out all over. It also made my hair easier to comb and with fewer snags (a miracle, because my hair tangles like crazy). It's not quite as good as the Deva Curl leave-in (but it's a lot less expensive), but it's better than Bumble and Bumble Don't Blow It, so it's a solid 4 star product on my hair.Overall, I'm very happy with this (I just wish it had a different scent)."

This product wasn't in curlscan but curlsbot said it had silicones and hard alcohols (yikes for a leave in).I honestly very rarely use silicones and my hair seems to really like this stuff but since I'm using it, I need to be sure to use a proper shampoo for cleanse when usually I would mostly co-wash. I definitely don't feel that my hair is transformed by this, but they have looked good on all the wash days that I've used it (I haven't tried it on a refresh for fear of weighing down my fine hair)I have 2b/2c fine hair and I have been using this as either the first or second step of the bowl method."
3,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Cream Serum Moisturizer for Curly Hair, Anti-Frizz, Made with Rose Water and Glycerin, 6.8 Fl Oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since the beginning of my day is busy (toddler & baby), I work full time, and only find time to work out after my last meetings/calls and before picking up the kids I generally shower at night. Which means my curls dry while I'm getting the littles ready and in bed and I then sleep on them. With that being the case, I need to make sure I put something in my hair at night to moisturize my curls and help defend the frizzes!I've been using this for a few nights and I have noticed that my curls keep better. They're not perfectly defined, but they definitely keep much better and my hair does feel more moisturized/the moisture is better locked in. When the description states that it was easy slip and is lightweight it is not lying. The cream serum is really light and easily and effortlessly glides through hair. The smell is nice as well, it smells like rose petals. It helps detangle and leaves your hair feeling soft. This is my after shower go to, so that the next day I just use a spray bottle to dampen my curls and then curl cream to help define and keep the frizz away. Overall, I like this as an added moisturizer and detangled."

I swapped out my usual leave-in with Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Cream Serum Moisturizer and was happy with the results, although it was not as moisturizing as I had expected it to be. Maybe I'm not using enough?I washed my hair and put this product in my damp hair from mid-shaft to the ends.  I scrunched and let my hair air-dry.  The results were soft with no crunchiness.  My curls were not overly defined, but there was no fuzziness.  The scent of the moisturizer is pleasant and it left my hair smelling good too.I would consider this a medium-weight moisturizer that would be best for thin to normal hair.  Thicker hair types may need to use more products or a different one to achieve optimum moisture retention."

I apply a little bit in my hair right out of the shower and then style as usual and I feel that my hair is easier to comb through and that I get less frizz between wash days. It has a nice and creamy consistency and has a nice scent as well. I have been using this every time that I wash my hair and since I only use a little each time it should last a while. For anyone who follows the curly girl method, this product does have drying alcohols in it. Overall, it worked well on my hair and made it manageable and soft."

This adds nice hydration and does seem to help with her curls. I feel like it's actually similar to a face serum in the way that I still use a moisturizer after a serum...and with this serum, and her hair type, I still prefer to add some leave-in conditioner. Also, while I like the Ros rose scent, my daughter isn't a big fan of it but will deal until it's finished- we'll buy once we're out of there's other scents available. I don't feel like I have to use a ton each time so that's a plus- especially since she has a lot of hair!"

It worked okay in my daughters fine curly hair. It is a fairly lightweight product and I think it works best in conjunction with other moisturizing products.

It definitely coats the curls really well and leaves them defined, moisturized with shine. It doesn’t weigh my hair down but keep my soft and bouncing. I’m not crazy about the scent as it’s a bit strong."
1,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Rose Water, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy with this! Now I use a volumizer and a set of curly shampoo and conditioner. I also use a curl cream. Adding this has made a huge difference in the look of my curl. I couldn't get my hair to stop frizzing! It didn't care what anti-frizz thing I used. This stuff is amazing because it works to hold your curl like a gel but it incredibly soft and leaves your hair looking so good! I did put it on my scalp and worked down to the ends but I think I will just work it into the hair and not my head. I use a lot of volumizer and I think this is weighing it down and bit but I love the look.
2,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Rose Water, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",TOP 1000 REVIEWER,VINE VOICE,You better like the scent of roses. This is very heavily perfumed with the scent of roses. I personally couldn’t stand it. I gave this away after one use.When you push the pump down you get a big amount of foam in your hand. Then you work at through damp hair. And it should leave your hair soft. However in my opinion I felt it left my hair more crunchy. I did not like the product. I gave it away because I didn’t like how it felt in my hair and I didn’t like the foam and I did not like the scent of the roses.

I keep promising myself no more, then I see something that claims to be different and I cave. This product claims to be different.It does have a bit more hold than some other foams I've tried, but just not that much. If you like your hair soft, you'll be happy. I like that crunch, because it tells me my curls are holding up.Also, the perfumey, rose scent is EXTREMELY strong, especially when wet."
4,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Rose Water, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is a gel in the bottle but when you pump it it turns to a foam type mousse in your hand. You scrunch it up. It didn’t leave my hair crunchy at all. I knocked one start off because of how strong the rose scent is. I love rose and would love this scent on the gel if it was mild. This I could smell all day. It did make my hair super soft too. I recommend just be aware of the strong rose scent.
5,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Rose Water, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I personally don't have crazy curly hair but wanted to try this for the time that I need to detangle and have a nice clean looking curly hair. The spray has rosy scent which is pretty strong so if you are sensitive to smell, this might not be a good option for you. It works well to give you soft and smooth finish look curls but has medium hold to it which I personally don't like."

I did use too much on my first use and figured out that I needed to cut down on the amount, and once I figured that out, all was right in the curly haired world for me.Perfect separated well defined curls with only one product used...perfection!"
7,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Rose Water, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I know it's called ""Wash Day Delight"" but I use it the day after wash day (and beyond) for a bit of a refresh. It works nicely and goes in my hair cleanly. Because it comes out as a foam, it's easier to comb through than gel, but it feels and holds like gel.It has a powerful scent, but I enjoy it and it fades fairly quickly."
8,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Rose Water, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",VINE VOICE,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is such a neat product. It smells just like roses and it goes on smooth and really enhances my curls whenever I use it. I’m a big fan of the carol’s daughter products and this is the first time I’ve used this particular product and it’s great so far.

This product as a very strong rose scent. This product did not help with de-tangling hair. It is a very lightweight product, that added a great shine to hair. It did not add much moisture."

13,"Carol's Daughter Wash Day Delight Hair Gel to Foam Mousse Styler and Hair Detangler for Curly Hair with Rose Water, Natural-looking Hold, 8.5 fl oz",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Too little hold, weird definition","I don't know if it's the product itself or just my hair but this gives me the strangest curls I've ever had no matter how I try to apply it.It defines, but my curls look wonky and tend to lay flat even if the curl itself seems more pronounced. Like they're squashed almost?Additionally, for a foam-gel the hold is practically nothing. It forms a cast but upon scrunching it out it's like I didn't use a gel at all. It gives less hold than my Wella Eimi mousse that's a light to moderate hold.It's really disappointing for this brand because I tend to like the vast majority of their stuff."
