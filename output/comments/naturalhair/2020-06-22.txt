who_angel,hhpkn2,"if u don't mind, can you tell me more about how you did this braid out? like what products you used, how many braids you did, whether your hair was stretched or wet when you did them? only asking because this is like my goal braid out. looks amazing 💞"
Yosemitewild,hhipb6,"Cantu Alternative?&&&Recently I’ve been noticing Cantu has been getting a lot of heat on social media and I’ve used it since I was in middle school (College freshman now). I’m completely lost on what would be a good alternative. 

Any suggestions? Im 4c and have low porosity hair&&&Apparently they dry out natural hair and have cheap ingredients. Other than that people are just making fun of the product and it’s unusual."
boobearmomma,hhipb6,Camille rose naturals!
eikaneeru,hhipb6,"i transferred to terrenefusions on etsy + i think they have a website too, for my main hair care needs. sometimes will use mane choice 3-n-1 conditioner for a co wash as well."
nurse-ish,hhipb6,What heat have they been getting? This has always been a staple in my regimen.
Lapamasa,hhi9ml,So pretty!

kaypeehsn,hhi9ml,Wooooow that is gorgeous😭😭😭
DemiNoPipoka,hh6rb4,"Do you mean \*locs\*, boo? If so then when I had locs I would wash them maybe 2 times a week. I hated retwisting them because I didnt like the smell of the gel and since I live i a hot country (Mozambique) not washing my hair to maintain a hairstyle was a big no-no for me. I would wash my hair, apply olive oil to it and let it live. Indoors I would wrap my old pair of pantyhose on my hair all day, all night to avoid lint and dirt to get into your loc. But if you plan to retwist your hair with gel, retwist it, leave in a style, and wrap your hair (your retwist will last a while). Spray water daily and live your life. Conditioning your hair makes the coils wider, therefore, it will drastically slow down the locking process and I'm sure you'll have a hard time getting all the conditioner out of your locs."
woodley1992,hh6rb4,It’s time to commit&&&I’m getting lots soon. What do I need to know to take care of them

darkfires,hgya8s,You're beautiful and have gorgeous hair but I'm not sure about those banglets
ebrdshw,hgya8s,Beautiful! What day hair is this?
felina_,hgya8s,Your curls are gorgeous!!!!!!! I am planning on cutting my relaxed hair very soon and am very nervous about not liking it on me. So this is giving me inspiration!! Thank you :)
ghosteddd,hgya8s,"I’m having a really great hair day, I love how it came out! It’s taken a long time to like myself more with curls over straight/relaxed hair&&&&&&first time in 26 years where i am comfortable with my natural hair! parents telling me my hair was too difficult to do without straightening why??&&&omg thank you!! i had a break out recently and have been reworking my routine. happy pride 🥰🥰&&&thank you!!&&&thank you so much! i’m sure your hair is beautiful ☺️☺️&&&If you’re like me, you won’t like it for a little while (i got a lot of internalized racism growing up half white/in a mostly white community). It’s really hard to get used to when you’ve spent your entire life with straight hair. I went “natural” at 16 but I still straightened my hair regularly until last year and semi regularly until january! I’ve done it I think 3-4 times this year, and this is the first time I’ve looked in the mirror and realized I really love what I see! And I am so sad I missed out on years of loving a part of myself that’s this beautiful. You’re going to love it, even if you don’t at first!! It’s so freeing to realize you don’t need a relaxer to be confident or look amazing 💖 best of luck on your journey!! you’re gonna look fabulous&&&It was day 2!&&&lol they were the pieces i finger curled so they just fall there and back when i move my head!"

2noserings,hgwcx0,"Stretch out your hair! Do 2 strand twists on wet hair, let it dry for a few days then gently untwist and trim the dry ends. It won’t be perfectly even but with curly/kinky hair it’s harder to tell. Look up a tutorial on YouTube if you don’t know how to do twists it’s very easy"
ni38693,hgwcx0,"You could straighten it one last time and just focus on straughting the ends so you could trim it. Or take your chances with getting uneven ends by trimming it while it's curly. I think curly hair can disguise an uneven hair cut compared to straight hair so it probably won't look as bad as you think. 

One helpful tip I've gotten is to divide your hair into sections and braids them. Then trim each braid separately. This will make your haircut more even"
queensnotmemes,hgwcx0,I think if your ends are bothering you you should trim. In my experience leaving them just makes more knots.
stargyrl,hgwcx0,"What should I do?&&&So throughout the quarantine I’ve been completely heat free and I wanna keep it that way. But the problem is my ends are dry af and I wanna trim it (I cut my hair myself) but I would need to straighten it to do that because every time I’ve done it on wavy/curly hair it ends really uneven and thinned out looking. So I’m not sure if it’s worse to leave my dry ends or to straighten it even though I’m not really going out and seeing people. What do you guys think I should do? My hair is a combination of all the type 3s, mostly 3b I think."

rose647963,hgtb0p,"Because it needed to be said: your face and your smile are absolutely radiant! Hair looks awesome, but your face sparks joy. Have a good day!"
Guacamole363,hgrvg2,"Keeping your hair wet for hours and hours or overnight is the number one way to cause hygral fatigue (or moisture overload) as your cuticles are swollen and open for long long periods of time, which eventually leads to the protein bonds in your hair breaking down. So it’s actually not healthy for your hair in the long run or continuously"
LadyTK,hgrvg2,I tried once but my head was getting too hot and the deep condition just kept sweating. I ended up just washing it out in the middle of the night and blow drying it. My head got to swimming in the middle of the night 😂😂 so I’m all about letting it sit on my head for most of a lazy Sunday morning.
imeansurefineokay,hgrvg2,"Cannot agree more! 
An alt solution: get a hydration steamer (Amazon stocks at good prices) and use that 2x a month with a deep conditioner. I do it for 15min and it has done wonders for my hair in just a few months!"
khephira,hgrvg2,The way my scalp is set up...absolutely not lol. I’d also be paranoid that products would seep out onto my pillow or bed bc I am not a calm sleeper.
phof10_,hgrvg2,"Do you deep condition overnight?&&&I don’t use store bought deep conditioners bc I don’t feel they work on my hair. I’m not sure what porosity I have but I have noticed using protein in my DIY deep conditioners always make my hair look and feel better. I use avocado, coconut oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, honey, an egg and a few pumps of a conditioner to make the concoction creamy. When I was doing this weekly my hair was growing like wildfire. I would sleep with it or where it around the house for hours. I just started implementing it into my regular hair care routine again and have found some mixed opinions about wearing a deep conditioner overnight. It always worked for me but am curious to hear the opinion of other people with natural hair."
pointedpaintbrush,hgrvg2,"I used to do it before I started deep conditioning with heat because my low porosity hair would not fully absorb product otherwise, plus I didn’t want to double shower at the time. It wasn’t the best for my sensitive scalp, but my hair was honestly fine.

Yes, there are concerns, but just do what works for your hair :)"
