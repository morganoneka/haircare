originalsoul,g8kjei,I'm a guy with 4c hair and wash n gos pretty much don't work for me. I never get any real curl definition from them. Twist outs and braid outs are the way to go for definition with 4c hair imo. Ive posted a twistout picture before if you're curious.

jelly-lorum,g8k35s,"Bangs!?!?! 😬😬😬&&&So a few weeks ago, on a whim, I cut my own bangs. My curls are probably like.. eh idk 3c-4a. Ya know depending on the day. I’ve been stuck in the house and haven’t had to do anything really but soon I will have to go to work and idk how to style them. I don’t love them so far lol. Any suggestions?? Do any of y’all have bangs?&&&Yes, thank you! I think that’s what I’m not really feelin is the fact that when they’re dry, they are too.. idk fluffy? And I’m working on styling them better but it seems impossible for them to just hang normally."
meninadalua,g8k35s,No but thinking about getting some
moulinrouge77,g8k35s,"Have the same hair type I cut bangs a few years back and I really liked them for about a month then I kept having to shape and style them, feel like with curls they’re so much harder to maintain and hard to keep them even. I couldn’t get them out of my face fast enough but I think that’s every girls reaction when they’re not usually a standard bangs person, curly or not. 

My main struggle was how they never really worked too well when my hair was dry and tend to always go outwardly than downwards so make sure you keep them moisturized and somewhat on the longer side."
iileah772,g8jt7i,Question lol&&&What’s clarifying curly hair?
books_and_looks,g8jjbu,"If you can't find any ready-made deep conditioners, I've had a lot of success in making my own for my low porosity hair. Shea butter, honey, and whatever oils I'm feeling like that day. Usually olive, jojoba, or Jamaican Black Castor Oil."
forthepeople2,g8jjbu,"Lol you’re literally describing my hair! I found that these products worked for me

-TGIN honey hair mask. Full of moisture, no protein.  It also makes your curls pop. I 

-Shea Moisture Manuka Honey Intensive Hydration Hair Masque. Also moisturizing and thick consistency.&&&Oh my bad! I think they are in very small amounts and you shouldn’t worry too much . I’ve been using these products for years and the TGIN never makes my hair hard/dry. I also have 4c low Porosity hair that  is SUPER sensitive to protein , coconut oil , and aloe Vera. 

I suggest if you want to try them out , get the sample size ."
poke-xo,g8jjbu,"Does anyone know of a deep conditioner that doesn’t contain protein, coconut oil, or aloe Vera?&&&I have low porosity, protein sensitive hair. I would say it hates protein and dislikes/neutral towards coconut oil and aloe vera. I have been searching and can’t find a product that is void of all 3 of these ingredients. I would appreciate any suggestions!&&&I’ve seen a lot of good reviews of these products, but then I looked at the ingredients list and the first one has aloe vera and the second one has hydrolyzed rice protein😭. So I wasn’t sure if I should use them, but I might! If I can make sure aloe Vera and protein aren’t in any other of my hair products it might work out. Thanks!"

MrsSpock01,g8ieax,"4c hair consequences&&&I spent more than two hours today detangling my hair because of bad decisions. I tell myself it won't happen again but let's be honest it'll happy again later this week.

DreadfulLove,g8i8lr,"Way to open cuticles before deep conditioning routine for low porosity?&&&Last time I tried to deep condition my hair (using a product with more penetrable ingredients), my hair didn’t absorb any of it. Yes, I used heat. 

So if there’s anyway I can get my cuticles raised before I even start deep conditioning my hair, id love to try it. 

Just seems like no matter what I do, my hair is always dry af.

[edit to add]: I’ve been trying different things over the last few months. The last two weekends I shampooed my hair to cleanse it from my trial and error products, using a non-sulfate shampoo. I deep conditioned my hair using a hair drier with a honey based conditioner (can’t remember the name). Rinse out. Then use Shea moisture moisture retention leave in. Detangle with shea moisture’s curl enhance smoothie. Then eco styler gel (but I prefer Shea moisture’s glycerin based gels. I do all this in 4 parts that are further parted because my hair is so dense it could feed 3 heads with 3 pony tails. 

I have only had wash n go results since COVID shut in because I’ve never had the time to risk the attempt. My hair is happier than before because it is finally showing its true colors and is being curly and even very ringlety! But I’m still failing with keeping it moisturized and getting it moisturized to begin with. It seem like only the last couple inches of my hair actually curls up and stays curled. Everything else just becomes frizz.&&&Thank you! I usually apply it right then in the shower"

I wash my hair in the shower so I do all this at that time. if you don't apply your DC in the shower, maybe you can use a hair steamer to lift your cuticles before applying your DC."

My hg was Texture ID Leave-In Moisturizing Conditioner in the pink bottle. It’s a gel-like spray that was thick enough to refresh styles. Paired with water, it was super moisturizing. I could use it to slick down buns without gel!! It worked well with stylers and didn’t flake. It wasn’t oil rich like some cream conditioners but I liked that. Too many oils in a product can cause buildup.

I have low porosity, “4c” hair and my quarantine routine now is using water, leave-in, and grease and then doing flat twists or cornrows. Please drop your holy grails and quarantine routine!!

BlueMaroonLaflare,g8g4pp,Sis you are doing great keep it up👍🏾 thank you for your support n encouragement and don’t let that bleach get away from you if you have to clip your ends watch some YouTube videos
Smol_swol,g8g4pp,"Thankful for this community and all of you in it!&&&Hello wondeful people!

I hope this post is on topic enough and ok to share, I really wanted to reach out to you all!

I've been a lurker here and on other similar forums for many, many years. This community, and others like it, have taught me so much about hair.

I guess there's no better time than now to say that I have absolutely pin straight, naturally blonde but currently bleached hair - just about as far away from the glorious Natural crowns all of you have! But growing up, I didn't have anyone to teach me how to care for my hair or show me how to wear it with confidence, so I stumbled onto a Natural Hair forum when I was very young. I didn't know that different hair types would behave so differently, but oh boy did I learn quickly, lol! But I was captivated by the women building each other up for years - celebrating milestones and acheivements, sharing wisdom, empowering one another, I just kept coming back. I watched so many videos of women doing their own braids and thought to myself: ""wow - if that's possible, maybe I can teach myself how to do a French braid to keep my hair off my face."" I'm pretty good at that now and I'm learning some new protective styles at the moment that are appropriate for my hair type and culture - it's so nice to change things up once in a while!

Through the things I've learned here, I was able to have thick, strong and healthy hip length hair for my wedding, and now have healthy, icy bleach blonde hair. Who would have thought ""healthy"" and ""bleach blonde"" could go in the same sentence! I spotted my first split end today after nearly three months since my last trim (pls don't judge isolation is tough haha!), because I listened to you guys.

Not only have I learned how to care for, protect and grow healthy hair, I have learned and continue to learn why Natural Hair is so important and empowering. I have learned so much about culture, and in turn, opression and racism, which has led me to an empathy that I don't think I would have ever found on my own. And I promise to keep listening, forever and always.

Not only have you all taught me these things, you have all taught me so much about being a woman, about lifting others up. I know our cultures, our histories and our hair types are so very far apart, but I really wanted to give some encouragement and say that I'm so thankful that you all exist. You've taught me so much. I'll keep cheering you all on from the sidelines and get excited when you reach your goals!

I truly hope this comes across as lovingly and thankfully as I mean it. And I truly hope you're all doing well in these strange and uncertain times.

You're all absolute queens, and all of you have the most beautiful crowns. Thank you for who you are. <3"
atot20,g8g4pp,"We love to see it. Respect is always appreciated -- this post made me smile. Congrats on your own hair goals and more importantly, for sharing this."
BlueMaroonLaflare,g8b106,Cantu may not be the product for. I’ve been natural since 2013 and when I first started Cantu was a godsend. But they have changed their formula and my hair hates it now. I now you TGIN -  Thank God It’s Natural and can be on the pricey side but works. At this stage though it’s really trial and error since you do still have relaxed ends. I also transitioned before transitioned was a thing so once you cut off the ends finding the correct products would be easier. Try moisturizing hair nightly and see if that helps. I would also do a protein treatment once a  month. The best cheapest option is Aphogee 2 step treatment. When you moisturize use an oil like coconut oil or castor oil to seal in products. I hope this helps. You can also message me for any questions.
UrDadsFave,g8b106,Cantu has a lot of alcohol in if. If could be drying your hair out. It's time to start looking at ingredients in the products you use to see what your hair likes and doesn't like.
dbaby1890,g8b106,I am 6 months into my transition and I’m still confused on technique I’m not sure about how to properly take care of my hair on wash days I’m not sure what to do and at the moment I use cantu product also my hair is very dry it always has been anything I put in seems to “dry” also this is dry hair.&&&
xoNaria,g8b106,You should try using aloe vera juice to moisturize your hair. I've been natural for years and tried so many different types of leave in's that ended up leaving my hair dry the very next day.  Nothing has moisturized my hair as well as aloe vera juice and I'm so glad that I gave it a try. I use the lily of the desert brand and highly recommend it. Make sure to test on a small section of your head first to ensure no allergy issues exist and follow up with a sealing oil. Good luck!
AIDSisnobanter,g8a96r,"Get a silk or satin pillow case. I had the same issue and made the switch, never looked back."
BabyGothQ,g8a96r,"If you get a silk/satin pillowcase the two slippery fabrics (your bonnet) will glide past each other, instead of your cotton or whatever fabric pulling at it."
BaroqueGhost1,g8a96r,"I have a question if you don't mind, is the pillow case enough or should I use both things? I've never used either of them"
BlueMaroonLaflare,g8a96r,Bonnets and silk scarves are great for our hair at nighttime but they don’t stay. A trick I learned is to wrap a cotton scarf around bonnet or silk scarf to keep it in place. I hope this helps.&&&I hope OP tries it&&&Let’s us know if it helps
Cynostar,g8a96r,I usually put on my bonnet and put wide stretchy headband around that. Always works.
DreamyEyedCyclops,g8a96r,"Yes, satin pillow case would help. Or do a bonnet wrapped in a scarf. Another option is to change to a bonnet with a larger elastic band."
JemmJoness,g8a96r,"My bonnet REFUSES to stay on my head at night.&&&Granted, I’m a wild sleeper but my edges and kitchen get destroyed by scarves and ever since I switched to bonnets I’m seeing growth. However, I find myself having to wear buns a lot as the week goes on because the front (and back) of my hair gets so frizzy due to my bonnet slipping when I sleep. Suggestions?&&&I have satin pillow cases but i sleep so wild I often end up pillowless at night ( usually just sleep with my head kind of on my arm with my elbow bent) I tried doing satin sheets to combat this and I hateeeed them lol 😂 maybe I need to give them another chance&&&Interesting 🤔 I may try this tonight&&&Yea maybe mine is too small&&&I didn’t even know that was a thing, going on Amazon rn! Ty&&&Will do!"
Lil_PlutoStoner_Babe,g8a96r,I have the same problem. My Bonnet turns into Houdini and I'm so confused. Like how did you end up over there lol. I recommend with everyone else said. Silk pillowcase or satin. So if it slips off you're good.
OG_PunchyPunch,g8a96r,I used to have this problem as well (especially with scarves). I bought a bonnet with an adjustable string so I could loosen or tighten it to fit me perfectly.
knbubba,g8a96r,I do something similar ! I tie a bandana around the back of my head and then put my bonnet on to protect my edges from getting pulled on when my bonnet slips and to provide more traction for the bonnet to stay. It usually works out well !
natashaamilly1357,g8a96r,"Satin or silk pillow case or cover your pillow with satin or silk material, even if it the one you use to wrap your head with. That what I do and it makes a huge difference. I also stay cooler than I do with a non breathable material like that wrapped around my head."
originalsoul,g8a96r,Take a tie of some sort and tie it around your bonnet after you've put it on. I use a bandana and it works well for me.
sasha04e,g8a70k,What’s my hair type ?&&&
Nesscaloo,g84124,"Hey! Getting used to your natural hair is definitely a doozy at first but you've got this! What I did to help me feel more confident was finding accessories that complimented me. I liked wearing scarves in a way that left my hair exposed but made me feel cute and less awkward. I'll try and link a photo!

Edit: here's a ton of photos for [scarf styling inspiration](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03ANKI9luKm5urGKdR-k7bN1kEoeg:1587870045434&source=univ&tbm=isch&q=natural+hairstyle+with+scarf&client=ms-android-att-us&fir=UTpE3PpDbOmCTM%253A%252CI5WfVl71RX2mSM%252C_%253BA6RW1yISGD1uXM%253A%252CD1HajMQiCxYb6M%252C_%253BidAhXKy3mL-dhM%253A%252C-AeT3b2pSw2cfM%252C_%253B6zeQduhaxAdWHM%253A%252CHWNbebaS40kSwM%252C_%253BPRip-pQp84zyRM%253A%252Cob9euReL-nET_M%252C_%253Bp2DOokuynyu8WM%253A%252CQUWKsSGWlHV_FM%252C_%253BShUgcDQghnvZPM%253A%252CO1Me-S322-fSuM%252C_%253BvVLK5mk_1NTLXM%253A%252C1BrgOBRZ9OHVmM%252C_%253BBSOphBxgstsDHM%253A%252CEhpB88ZU4ZR1KM%252C_%253BG16JEvIcGGZ5NM%253A%252Cgt53iGGI-F9tgM%252C_&usg=AI4_-kTGxjXPqiKFpcSYqiHE0qfwVmyd0A&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwipsofwjIXpAhX5lXIEHe1rBiIQ7Al6BAgCEDQ&biw=412&bih=678&dpr=2.63)

Other than that, loving your hair comes with patience and finding which products work for you. I use Suave almond + shea butter for shampoo and conditioner, Cantu's hair masque for deep conditioning, and if I need to hydrate my hair between washes I dilute some of the conditioner in a spray bottle and use as needed. Hope this helps!"
dolphinne,g84124,"Awwww! I'm sorry ;-;, I'm kind of dealing with the same situation at the moment. Like you, I'm having trouble with my hair (it's also 4c I think and thick also), especially loving it.

I'm bad at advice but here's some things you can do to help with your problem

1) Watch some YouTubers who have your hair type or similar (like naptural85,Joy-el and Nia Iman). I don't really know how to explain it but watching people who have the same interests/deal with similar stuff can help. You might get some inspiration on what to do w your hair. Feel cute or something ;)

2) Have some family members or friends that you can talk to about what's going on (if they don't support it then that's on them), support can be a BIG cause to gaining confidence bc you have ppl there for you

3) Take your time loving yourself. Don't rush immediately to do this, it won't happen overnight. It takes time, even popular ppl/celebrities have their moments of not loving themselves 

And remember there's ppl in this community who are here to help and support one another

(Sorry if I sounded cringy in any way, I just wanna help ;-;)&&&Oh yeah, wearing different types of clothing, jewelry can also help. It can make you rock your fro more ;)"
primaltriad77,g84124,"I did the big chop more than 3 years ago. I did it at the beginning of a vacation so I had a week to get used to it. My hair hadn't been that short since I was 2! Definitely an adjustment! Luckily, a lot of people had good things to say about it. It was cool to feel the wind blow through my short hair and through to my scalp. (It just felt different for some reason.) Plus I found that I had extra time getting ready for work in the morning because I wasn't struggling with my hair, trying to make it submit. The shrinkage is real though, I'm not gonna lie. It will look like you merely have an afro for a loonngg time. But when your hair grows out and it's healthy and not breaking off, it will be worth it. You definitely need patience in the first year because you won't see that obvious growth because of the shrinkage. BUT shrinkage is a sign that your hair is healthy. I oiled my scalp at least 2x a week during the first year and I only washed it every week and a half or 2 weeks, sometimes up to 3 weeks. For the oil, I used 2 parts Jamaican Black Castor Oil, 1 part grapeseed oil, and 1 part almond oil. I poured the 3 oils into one of those plastic bottles you put hair color in, the one that has the nozzle top and has the measurement marks on the side. 

I hope this helps! For the record, I'm 4B with low porosity and my hair is medium to thick density."
selfloveselfcare,g84124,"Finding it hard to get used to my hair, anyone relate?!&&&I started of going natural at the beginning of the lockdown but i'm finding it so hard to get used to, I love that my hair is different but i feel like i'm never going to get used to dealing with it, it's very thick, medium density, low porosity 4C hair, i've recently come to terms that i love that it's 4C, because of how unique this hair type is, but i am struggling dealing with it and finding quick, sleek or very 'yassss'  hairstyles that i can feel like i'm in control of my hair.

I feel frustrated that i'm not used to it yet and feel i won't get there before i have to return to work after this lockdown, i don't want to have to put my hair in a protective style to just avoid my hair again, i want to learn and love it. I don't really feel confident or beautiful atm because i'm so nervous showing others my hair, as it has been in protective styles or relaxed most of my life. Can't ask my mum because she suggests relaxing it, i don't want to.

Do you have any advice? Motivation? Positivity? Because i'm running out of positivity. I just want to be confidently rocking this fro, pleasee helpppp, if you need pictures i can provide.&&&Doesn't sound cringey at all! That's what i need support. I only started following Joy-el, never found anyone as close to my hair texture since, idk why i never found her sooner. With Naptural85 i feel like her texture isn't like mine, but this could be because hers is way longer but also executing any styles she does, fails for me. Feels so relatable with joy-el because she does a style, it may fail then trys to work with it, which i feel like i go through a million times.&&&The scarf idea is fantastic, just looked at the link and felt inspired just need some lovely scarfs now.&&&Oh yeah i love those plastic bottles with the nozzle, getting straight to the scalp. For some reason black jamaican castor oil doesn't agree with me."
NnonoMo,g828df,"Hard to tell. The difference in texture/thickness between the roots and the ends leads me to believe that your hair is either heat-damaged or heat-trained. Do you press it a lot, have a keratin treatment, or do Brazilian blowouts?"
