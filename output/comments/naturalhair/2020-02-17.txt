Leading-Praline,f8l07e,"My low porosity hair hates:

Pure Aloe Vera Juice

Pure Coconut Oil

Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil

My try something from the Soultanicals line - they have lots of products to choose from.  And yes, I have taken a conditioner that I like, diluted it with lots of water and used that as a spritz.    My secret weapon is making a spritz using Elderberry flower tea.  Make the hair very soft and hydrated.  You just have to find the right concentration of tea for your hair.  I make mine pretty weak."
montero19,f8l07e,What a good hydrating sprits leave or mix in for low porosity? In aloe Vera juice good? Suggestions&&& I have low porosity hair and to prevent heavy product build up and irritation I prefer to use protein free sprits leave in through out the week. I only use a cream leave in on wash day. What are some suggestion that leave your hair feeling moisturized? Could i take some cream leave in and dilute it in water or?
kodiakcity,f8hyr6,"Shrunken moist hair! First time seeing my hair fully (half of it) out of the protective twists I wear it in 99% of the time in over a year! I’m past tailbone when it’s stretched, but it shrinks to mid back normally (my right side was tied back and still in twists hence why it looks kinda weird lol).&&&"
TooBold,f8hhzt,"Yeah Kinky Curly is a fave for wash n goes. 
I like Eco gels (especially the argan oil one). And Cantu leave in."
domtoobomb,f8hhzt,"Kinky Curly vs Shea Moisture for wash n go&&&I have concluded that I prefer the Kinky Curly line for a more defined wash n go for my 4a/4b hair. The Shea Moisture Coconut Custard line does the job but it’s way less defined.

Examples: These are both day 1 hair

What are your opinions about these products and what are your best wash n go products?"
d9niels9n,f8h1js,"Tying hair down&&&I wear my hair in two-strand twists. At night, I wear a durag so my hair isn’t oriented in every-which direction when I wake up. They’re getting to the length now where they extend below my durag. The “problem” I’m starting to see is the ones that do extend below my durag will curl upward at the spot my durag ends which is just kinda annoying. So, any tie down alternatives that’ll keep my hair laid down at night, but prevent this?"
forthepeople2,f8h1js,"Hey , I’m currently wearing 2 twist strand now and I’ve also had this problem. 

The only solution that I have found is to use a satin Pillowcase at night..They’re really useful and will not make your ends curl."
sqwzmahmeatybts,f8h1js,"Maybe switching to bonnets? They aren't as restricting, but still protect your hair while sleeping."
Racine17,f8gzdh,"I don't have high porosity hair, mine is actually low porosity so I'm not speaking from personal experience. However one of my aunts has high porosity hair and it seems her hair does best when she layers products, like a leave in conditioner followed by a heavy butter."

kevessi,f8gzdh,"Hey everyone, i posted recentlt gere but didn’t know what my hairtype is. Now i found out. I have really thin 4c high porosity hair.

CoffeeB4Talkie,f8dmj2,"Depends on your hair. For me, I can't leave JBCO in. I have to rinse it out."
Disturbia8081,f8dmj2,Castor oil&&&Currently doing another wash day and I was  wondering can I use Jamaican black castor oil for the LOC method instead of jojoba oil?( I don't have enough for my full head of 4c hair)  Has it worked it worked for anyone on this sub?

Worstmodonreddit,f8aigz,"You should post a picture. 

Also, you should be more cognizant of how you're describing your hair in such negative terms. It's not uncooperative, it's just afro textured. It does what it's meant to do."
thepe24,f8aigz,"Need help with natural hair (17, 4c(?), thin, mixed porosity, mixed race)&&&Hello, I'm a blond, half-black girl with very uncooperative hair. I don't know if this is the right place to go for advice about taking care of my hair but I'm at my wits end. 

I've always had problems with my hair since I was a kid. The back of my hair would always be soft and moisturized while the front would be as dry as a tumbleweed. I was able to grow it out to be waist-length by the time I was in 3rd grade though. All of this length completely vanished when I was in 8th grade, since my grandmother loved to flat-iron my hair every single day. I tried to fix my hair by putting it in protective styles (like box braids and twists) but didn't know how to properly moisturize my hair while they were in these styles. I also put my hair in buns and ponytails slicked down with gel whenever I didn't have my hair in protective styles, which led to lots of hair loss (especially on the bottom of my scalp and right side of my head) and my hairline receding. 

Today, I'm dealing with very dry, uncooperative hair with a super itchy scalp. I've tried doing twist outs, tried all sorts of products such as Blue Magic, Cantu leave in conditioner spray, kinky curly knot today leave in, tea tree peppermint shampoo and so many more things which didn't help my hair much. If pictures can guide anyone in giving advice I'm willing to post them. At this point I want to do a big chop but my mother won't let me."
DreadfulLove,f8a312,"What’s your two-strand twist routine?&&&I’m trying to figure out why the results are so different. When I studied abroad some years ago, I put in two strand twists every weekend or every other weekend.  I shampooed between and probably didn’t condition. I might have put an oil or grease on the strands and scalp, but I can’t remember what.  That’s all I did and my hair great long. 

My hair seems to be growing evenly, but it’s not growing at that same rate. This is what I do:

1) Shampoo with SM’s Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo with hair OUT;

2) Condition with Coconut Oil;

4) Twist wet or damp with SM’s leave in-conditioner and choice oils, usually argon

5) Leave in for at least 1wk, re-moisturize while retwisting each twist after a week. Take all down after 2nd or 3rd week. 

My hair gets dry really quickly, and historically I have not been on my moisturizing A game. But lately I’ve started an intentional moisturizing routine for these twists, wherein I am to deep condition every week, co-wash mid week with twists IN, moisturize my ends every night, and carefully oil and massage my scalp every night. 

Would you suggest any changes? I have really big coarse thick 3b/3c hair and am so scared of leaving twists in for washes with wash-out only products. 

What methods do you use when your fall back is to have in twists?"
EliteBodSquad,f887mk,"I continue the lco method over my braids (I.e water, Shea based leave in conditioner, then Jamaican castor oil). Seems to be working, i do this after washing once a week"

isleepbad,f85mzk,Have you gotten anything yet? I'm also interested in locing my hair. So far microlocs seem the most interesting.
tauruspiscescancer,f85mzk,"Interested in starting a loc journey?&&&Hey guys! So I’ve been thinking about getting locs on and off for about 2 years now. But more recently, I’ve taken this interest more seriously. I’ve been watching YT videos, reading online, contacting people on IG about their journeys (only one person that I saw who really inspired me to get them this year) and I am also going to reach out to people I know with locs and ask them questions. 

Does anyone here have locs? If so, would you mine giving me some advice on how to start and what your process was like?

Please and thank you! Much love. 💗✊🏿&&&Nope, no help at all. 😂"

adrianlyseight,f7zfbw,BEST KEPT SECRET SERUM FOR RAPID HAIR GROWTH - HOW THIS LADY GREW MY HAIR FAST ...&&&
Ashleyjasmine,f7zark,"My hair only feels soft when it’s wet.&&&During the wash process my hair feels amazing - my tangles practically disappear, my curls bang and most importantly it feels soft. Once it dries however my hair feels ridiculously dry as if I didn’t apply anything, or oily but in the way that I can tell it’s dry underneath my products. Recently I’ve had a bit of colour damage which my hair dresser cut out for me and now I’m waiting for my hair to dry so I’m waiting to see how it goes but honestly I’m not hopeful. Does anyone else have this problem/have any advice? Should I wet my hair more during the week?&&&Most clarifying shampoo feel really harsh on my hair but I’ve never tried acv I’ll look into that thank you&&&What do you use to deep condition?&&&4a I believe&&&That makes a lot of sense actually. I don’t really like products with oils and butters high up in the ingredients, I prefer aloe and glycerin based stuff. It’s not hard to find conditioners like that but styling products are definitely more of a challenge."
EloquentElixir,f7zark,"Well to start off, what's your hair type?"
Leading-Praline,f7zark,"It seems like you have to first experiment to determine the effect that products, substances are having on your hair.  So although many people love coconut oil, it makes my hair rough in its pure form.  Same with aloe vera and Jamaican black castor oil.  I can tolerate these items as an ingredient in a product (as long as it not in the top 3), but not in their pure forms.  They make my hair dry and brittle after my hair dries."
hewokemeupagain,f7zark,"My hair sounded a lot like yours. What I've been doing lately that's made it retain moisture so much better is

1. ACV rinse. I don't do this often, but it's the first step when my hair is feeling off just to start from neutral
2. Deep conditioning after every full wash (every 1-2 weeks)
3. Flat twists. This is the big one. After I wash, I rarely do a wash and go, I mainly do flat twists. I started this because my hair has multiple textures so it makes it look uniform, but it's made a HUGE difference in how my hair holds moisture. I work a leave in and gel through each section (10-12) and flat twist each one and WOW. When I take it out (around a week) my hair is so moisturized and it's a cute twist out too. I can wear that for another week if I want, without my hair looking/feeling dry (no need to refresh). I just wear a scarf every night and even if it falls off it's fine. 

 NOTE: when I do the twists my hair has to be dripping wet so it can dry in the twists."
kHyp26,f7zark,Maybe you need to clarify your hair with a clarifying shampoo or Apple Cider Vinegar rinse to help your strands soak up and hold onto the moisture more effectively. It could be product buildup that's causing it to feel dry.
0423beatface,f7yj1t,"I’m by no means an expert, but I’ve had this same problem. Is your wig human hair, or synthetic? Most of my wigs are synthetic and I’ve smoothed them out by applying a heavy conditioner/ oil mix on the sections (usually the back/ ends) that tangle the most often. I brush it with this mix on it, and leave it on for a couple of hours, then rinse it out. Then when it dries I apply a mix of liquid fabric softener & water from a spray bottle. It helps to soften the fibers/ hairs of the wig. Again- this is for a synthetic, not human hair wig. It usually works to keep the wig hairs more smooth and less inclined to tangle. Also, if it’s a longer wig, when you wear it, pull it back into a low ponytail or bun so the tangles aren’t as noticeable. When you wear it down and the hairs brush against your clothes constantly it makes it worse. Good luck with your interview! :)&&&Yes- dilute it with water"
ellen_water-melanin,f7yj1t,"Wig Tips Please!&&&Hello everyone !

My choice of protective styles will vary from wig to braids. Right now I’m currently sporting my wig which I got about 2 years ago. My wig is essentially on its last leg, however, at this exact moment I can’t afford braids. I am upcoming college grad and I’ve been interviewing a lot. So much so that I’ve landed a second interview at the headquarters this upcoming Wednesday.

Here’s the problem: as previously stated I can’t do braids right now. I will spirts my wig with conditioner and water every time before bed. It works but doesn’t last long. Luckily for me I have morning classes so I’m back home by 11. My wig tangles like you’d never believe. Sometimes I have to bring my water spray and brush and sneak to the bathroom just to detangle my hair. I wash and condition it at least once a week. My fear is that my wig won’t last me from 8-5 this upcoming Wednesday and for an interview that’s not good. (Touring the HQ, Q&A session with executives and 3 interviews so yes 8am-5pm). 

Please help me with my wig fiasco. Today is Saturday so I have a couple days to get some product and do whatever needs to be done. Thanks in advance. 🤗&&&Fabric softener as in... like downy? I will definitely try this ! Thank you !"
