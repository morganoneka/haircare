Overall-Necessary285,s0b1yq,"I'm a woman who also did a buzz cut.You can do it, it will help you grow healthier hair"
spaceboyeddy,s0b1yq,"Will buzzing help in this regard?&&&So I'm a male facing some slight thin hairs and problem areas due to wearing my durag almost 24/7 for a couple of months, and too tight at that.

Was wondering if I'm damaging or making any matters worse if I were to buzz my head and start over with a complete and utter reconditioning of my scalp using the best oil mixture I've probably concocted in a while, or if I should just thug it out and keep applying to my 1.5 inches of thinnish hair instead. 

I heard buzzing your head is just problematic as its causing trauma to the follicles everytime you fade or cut hair in general with electronic clippers, but at the same time, my hair always grows slow as hell when I don't get haircuts or atleast trim some length off from time to time.

What can y'all tell me?"
JadedMis,s0a3ur,Have you tried r/curlyhair?
JemmJoness,s0a3ur,Do you deep condition?
KEnyinna,s0a3ur,Are you using heat on your hair?
OneofManyJailyns,s0a3ur,It could be due to manipulation. Do you pull your hair back in ponytails frequently or stretch that part of your hair more than the other? The part underneath could be doing better because you kept your hands out of it more. My advice is to try doing a steam treatment and a protective style to give your top section a break.
Scarlette__,s0a3ur,"Is this right after a wash, or a couple days later? Do you cover your hair when you sleep?"

OvertureStealer,rzxuae,"I did crochet for the first time! (details in comments)&&&&&&(commenting again bc I think my comment got removed for linking to a video) I followed a braidless crochet method tutorial using the springy afro twist 16"" hair. I blew out my hair the night before and slept in some twists. I had some trouble getting used to the latch hook at first, but it got easier to do as I went. For people who have done crochet before, I was wondering if it's possible to do without blowing out your hair. I'm happy with my results but I don't typically like blowing out my hair and it's harder to get knots out when it's blown out imo.&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you, and I had no leave out. I'll keep that in mind for next time (:"

WiltedWallFlow3r,rzxuae,"What type of net do you use, and how do you attach it? Would u recommend that l-part crochet caps?"
dearDem,rzxuae,"You did a great job! 

Did you leave any of your hair out in the front? Either way I don‚Äôt blow mine out either. If I‚Äôm doing a style like that I‚Äôll put my hair in twists and then put a net over it, and crochet the hair onto that.

Be careful with this method though because I‚Äôve definitely snipped a twist on take down. The twists still need to be secured nearly under the style."
fivefivew_browneyes,rzxuae,Super cute and natural! Looks like it‚Äôs growing from your scalp. I‚Äôve got box braids now and haven‚Äôt don‚Äôt crochet for about a year but I rocked it for a while as my go-to protective style.

Bear_Bones_mom,rzlkmz,"Controversial thought but maybe only use the leave in or the curl smoothie, not both then follow with the gel. With low porosity hair there can be such a thing as too much of a good thing."
Chochi8383,rzlkmz,I noticed the more product I use the more I get a defined/crunchy type of curl then it relaxes after a day or two. Use more product. A cream. An oil/grease then a gel or mousse ...you might like a product line called ‚ÄúTwist‚Äù by ouidad it‚Äôs at Walmart & target & is really good for defining curls.

EloquentElixir,rzlkmz,"Well, unfortunately until your hair gets longer it won't hang the way you want it to. Shrinkage is unavoidable, and no amount of product will ever negate it. You could try stretching it out to elongate the curls, but thats about it"
LtDoomie_,rzlkmz,R u sure the products ur using regularly mix well together? In tha second pic there r little white dots in ur hair that could be bc of ur product combo. When I use products that don‚Äôt mix well I get some of the problems u described(especially when I use eco)
Pumpser9000,rzlkmz,"I found with mine, limiting heat when diffusing to prevent frizz and only drying it half way leaving the rest to air dry.

It could also be the products you are using to wash your hair with, they may be stripping and therefore cause more frizz and less definition. Make sure to deep condition, that‚Äôs a big game changer.

Or it could be the products you are using the style ur hair with. Maybe try something more heavy like gel or combining ur styler now with gel."

ocxtber,rzjs87,Any natural hairstylist recommendations in the Northern VA area&&&Pretty much what the title says. I recently started a full time job and don‚Äôt have as much time as I use to to do my hair. I have 4c hair and am very tender headed. I haven‚Äôt had the best experience so far so hoping y‚Äôall could help me
Legal-Yvie,rzh56q,I‚Äôve never used shampoo in my hair. I‚Äôve used Black soap and a deep conditioning treatment.
Melodic_Ad3500,rzh56q,I suspect you need to find a good clarifying shampoo to remove all product buildup and then follow up with a moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioner. Make sure to seal in moisture at the end of the wash day using the LOC method. I am a hair coach and would love to help you. www.texturedhaircoach.com.
Numerous_Win_1123,rzh56q,The most moisturizing shampoo I‚Äôve ever used is the design essentials almond & avocado shampoo. Not exactly sure what ingredient is in it that makes the hair so soft but the formulation is perfectüíï
OneofManyJailyns,rzh56q,"Lol I just saw this comment. Said the exact same thing üòÇ&&&I love design essentials Avocado and almond shampoo and my hairstylist has noticed a vast improvement in my hair's length and moisture retention. A little goes a super long way; I've been working off of the same bottle for over a year now. And the company is black owned so ‚ú®bonus points‚ú®.

I noticed you said you were in Canada, but there are a couple of companies that ship, including straight from DE and Ulta. 

My hair is 4a-4b for the most part if that helps, but the shampoo is for all curl types.

PunkGF,rzh56q,"Sorry but all of those shampoos are horrible. Also is it actually a shampoo problem exclusively?What‚Äôs your hair routine like?

Shampoo I use for weekly shampoo/condition routine is AG Balance shampoo and AG Boost conditioner"
deathofthesibyl,rzh56q,"I'm going to have to side with one of the other commenters, unfortunately for natural hair if it's under $15, I'd be really skeptical.  I also have really, really dry hair and I only shampoo like, once every week at most. Otherwise, I just co-wash with the As I Am Coconut Cowash. If your hair is natural, you really don't need to shampoo all that often.  I've had friends with thicker, drier hair shampoo once every two weeks. I'd suggest splurging on a more expensive one and using it very sparingly. Some of the ones I've tried that work for me:

1. John Masters Shampoo 
2. Black soap (Just the black soap. It has shea butter in it and tends to work wonders)
3. Olaplex (expensive but worth it)

Also, what might help is sectioning your hair before you shampoo, then once you're done shampooing a section, immediately applying your conditioner and moving on to the next section. I used to wash my hair like white girls in movies and it wasn't working for me at all. 

Aussie, Creme of Nature, and African Pride Shampoos are *not* good for your hair. I'm not familiar with the other brand."
happyhippoking,rzh56q,"Have you tried pre-pooing first? Pre-pooing can blunt the effects of a drying shampoo. You can pre-poo with an oil, conditioner, aloe vera; there's a lot of options.

Emotional-Box5049,rzglg1,"After so much trail and error I‚Äôve finally figured out how to take care of /style my hair the way I like it ! Any treatments that will accelerate hair growth for my type of hair, high porosity?&&&&&&*trial&&&1. I co-wash every 4-6 days since my preferred style is wash in go and that can lead to buildup . I L O V E the intense pattern conditioner. 

2. I like to listen to my hair but every 2 weeks I would say I shampoo my hair with a gentle product, I deep conditioning and then I do the same thing I do after co-washing. 


3.After co-washing my hair I make sure it is drenched (I detangle my hair with my hands with the conditioner)  then I (1) apply a CLEAR leave-in condition ( like the one from curls or S curl curl activator) (2) This is optional but it adds that  definition and pop‚Ä¶. mousse( I really like the got2b kinky) (3) I apply aragn oil ecostyle evenly throughout the hair( make sure you use enough) (4) This is so important ‚Ä¶.. SHAKE YOUR HEAD, shake shake shake shake and that will get all your coils defined ( forget shingling, denman brush‚Ä¶ etc etc which is time intensive and doesn‚Äôt really work well on kinky hair) 

4. When I go to bed I Bobby pin the front of my hair and use hair bands to stretch the back of my hair. I know this sounds crazy but I swear by it ‚Ä¶. I use a shower cap and then a satin scarf over my hair. The shower cap locks in the moisture and the scarf further keeps your hair in place. 

5. Also if my hair isn‚Äôt dry by the tine I go to bed I use a $25 dollar hooded dryer I got off Amazon 

I‚Äôve really really got this routine down. It typically takes me 30 min to do my hair on a co-washing day, about 1.5 on a full wash day, and several min to put my hair up at night. I‚Äôm in college and I need a routine  that won‚Äôt take too much time or maintenance. I would also say my hair is super moisturized and healthy with this routine."
Empathology-Today,rzglg1,"You have beautiful hair! My current hair growth regiment is MSM, biotin, and vitamin C supplements in the morning. I also style my hair in a WnG and to add moisture and refresh my curls, I use an aloe Vera based spray infused with amla and fenugreek. I seal in the moisture daily using castor oil especially on my ends. At night I lightly oil and massage my scalp with a hair growth oil. I love the one by Camille Rose Naturals. It has so many healthy and natural ingredients. Every week I use a henna deep conditioning gloss (made at home). My hair is currently passed bra strap length."
SereneSista,rzglg1,What is your routine that you have found works?
Legal-Yvie,rzbyrk,What did you do in the first place to get a burnt smell?
herinquisition,rzbyrk,"Curls came back but hair smells burnt when washing - have any of you experienced this?&&&I guess this is my heat damage story, but has anyone else had this experience? I used products to get the burnt smell out of my hair a few days after silk pressing it and it smelled fine. Now, one of my conditioners has a weird smell but it never lingered in my hair so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it. (Could be though but idk‚Ä¶)

Usually when people talk about heat damage, it‚Äôs about the curls not coming back. Some naturals say it takes. A few washes for curls to bounce back completely. My curls definitely came back, but they might be a super slight bit looser, but nothing to write home about. But I noticed that when I was washing my hair, that burnt smell came back. It faded a bit as it dried but there‚Äôs still a faint scent that is just not how my hair usually smells. Has anyone else experienced this and how did you get rid of it? I guess it will go away on its own but yikes. I was thinking of silk pressing again in feb but I changed my mind. I may do it again in the fall and maybe get someone else to do it tbh.&&&Silk press - had a stylist blow dry and flat iron my hair

The smell is fading as I wash it more. It was just weird to me."
ontariodwarf,rzbyrk,"This has happened to me too! I assumed it was heat damage but my curl pattern didn‚Äôt change and the smell eventually went away. If you Google it (like I did), it seems really common but it‚Äôs a sign of heat damage. Not sure if you can have heat damage without loss of curl but I‚Äôve had a similar experience"
popcornnhero,rzbyrk,This happened to me before and I wanted to gag while washing my hair. The smell went away after I deep conditioned but I think it was from the heat protectant and iron that leaves that smell once your hair comes wet.
