freedafro,bd82ab,What are your experiences with henna?&&&[removed]
freedafro,bd6rjz,My hair has been shampoo free for the past 5 months and it feels great.&&&
SugarPie89,bcx04u,"Can I use Velcro Rollers in my natural hair?&&&My boyfriend ordered me these rollers on Amazon and to my dismay they are Velcro. My fault I guess I didn't look at the product well enough when I added them to my wish list. They are the xnicx 36 Count Self Grip Large Small Medium Hair Rollers. Have any of you used ""self grip"" or velcro rollers before? Will they pull out my hair? I was thinking of returning them. Here is what they look like:

sqwzmahmeatybts,bcx04u,"I ABSOLUTELY have used them before. You just have to be careful and meticulous af. Make sure your hair is well moisturized and that you aren't in a rush. 

If it's a flop, you tried it once. If it's bomb, then...you got bomb hair."

niff20,bcjowt,"Black Readers&&&Not sure if this is allowed but I just wanted to come here to let y'all know I started a sub yesterday for black readers that are tired of the racism, micro-aggressions, and lack of representation in other book subs. It's r/BlackReaders \- just a space to talk about black books and other literature of all sorts without being downvoted for pointing out the racism in a book they still may enjoy."
npbm2008,bcjowt,I‚Äôm in!
nursebae,bcjowt,Awesome. Thanks!
yourbestbudz,bcjowt,Great idea. I just subbed and already bought a book based off comments üò´
PeacesofAutumn,bbqw9g,Maybe a cute ‚Äúdonut‚Äù bun with your edges slicked back. Add colored clips to match your outfit. You can get the base for the bun from any beauty supply store. This was my go to style in school.
WilmaVilma,bbqw9g,"Cute, neat, and fun hairstyles for school?&&&I always wear my hair loose because it‚Äôs so easy but it‚Äôs getting really boring and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so healthy for it. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone have some suggestions for me that are relatively easy to do and look nice and neat for school?

I have type 3b hair, about mid bra length"
bbrae_alldayerrday,bbqw9g,"I know this is late as hell, but space buns are always super cute (try googling Janelle Monae space buns).  You could leave a few curls loose in the front or back."
Sharbubbles972,bbh89s,"HELP! Box braid disaster - Build-up and Knot Edition&&&I've had my box braids in for 2 months. üëÄ I've never had thing things in before... the lady me to use edge control if my ends start coming out 

By the end of this 2nd month, I'm taking out my hair....as we speak.

I don't know if i use too much edge control but there is so much buildip from where my hair meets the fake hair. Like a puddy knot on each braid section.....

I had two small pieces that look like dreads..

My hair doesn't seem that much longer. I thought it was growth... but i'm wondering if it was just slippage.

What so you recommend. I'm freaking out... is this normal?!.!

I'm so scared right now...&&&Trying this out right now. Thank you!!!!&&&Thankfully, i didn't wash my hair... but this is terrifying. I'm praying. Lol.&&&Big mistake. Learned my lesson! Thanks for the reco!&&&In the 2 months that I had them, i used leave in shampoo twice and washed them once.

I used it anywhere where I felt my hair looked fuzzy. :/&&&Yeah, I'm terrified right now. Definitely, scared and might not get these again."
Subparwoman,bbh89s,I would use lots of conditioner (one with a lot of slippage) and water to help slowly detangle. Hair is always easier to detangle when it's wet and conditioner will provide better slippage than oil. Keep the hair soaking as you go and just make sure you don't yank and pull.
carmieeee,bbh89s,Use Apple Cider Vinegar before you wash and let it sit. It‚Äôll help the dirt slide right out.
empathalogist,bbh89s,"Get some oil/hair grease and use your fingers to gently loosen up the knots in your hair. You may even need to let the oil sit on those matted bits before you get started. This kinda acts like a lubricant between the strands. 

If you really take your time and be gentle, you should be OK. Load up a couple movies and be ready for the long haul. Finger detangle as much as you possibly can before washing or wetting your hair. Then detangle with your wide tooth comb. 

From now on it just means that you can't wear box braids for that long, cause you know you're hair will become matted. 

Good luck!"
j0rd4n4,bbh89s,"Quick story on how I ended up going natural. I got box braids to help me transition for a bit and I had them in for two months. While I‚Äôm taking them off I notice I have build up on my braids , I decided the best thing to do in this situation is obviously wash my hair. VERY WRONG.  I had knots everywhere and the buildup didn‚Äôt leave and my only option was to cut my hair. I‚Äôm not sure what you decided to do but I hope you didn‚Äôt wash your hair."
mumibee,bbh89s,Did you wash your hair while they were in? And did you use edge control everywhere or just on the front?
naturallyjoy,bbh89s,"Second this! I usually put the apple cider vinegar  and mix it with water,  put it in a spray bottle and spray it directly on the knot."
tallulahbelly14,bbh89s,"No need to panic, it‚Äôs easily fixed!

Personally, I would take the braids out now, washing and conditioning thoroughly beforehand. Two months is long enough anyway. 

You‚Äôre right - that buildup is very difficult to remove once it‚Äôs there. Next time, you should consider washing your hair more regularly so that it doesn‚Äôt accumulate in the first place."
tnibhadtot,bbh89s,Remember to wash your braids or at least your edges if you are using gel/edge control. Buildup can cause hair loss.
TheseNaturalCurls,bbeggv,"I had this issue when I did my big chop and beyond. THE FIX for me... 1. No tension. 2. No heat 3. COLD RINSE. 4. No manipulation.
 When I rinse conditioner out of my hair I use the coldest water I can tolerate. My thought is that the cold water causes the follicles to close making the strand overall smoother and trapping some of the conditioner INSIDE the hair strand. Then I use a microfiber turban towel and leave it on for about 20-30mins. I DO NOT RUB MY HAIR DRY. I want the curls to clump together and in the end that gives me a more defined curl."
hippielyss,bbeggv,"I agree with one of the other responses. You can nurse your hair back to good health. I never did a big chop when I went natural. I just stopped using heat and started doing twist outs with deep conditioners and performed hot oil treatments on my hair. 

If you‚Äôre concerned about one side being longer than the other, you could trim it to be the same length but it‚Äôs up to you. Wish you well!"
ipooptreasure,bbeggv,"This sounds like my exact situation when i started out. I started my natual hair journey about 2 years ago without doing a big chop so i could legit see the differences in sections of my hair throughout the years and it does sound like the hair thats not curling up may still be damaged, especially if the same patch of hair is curling at the root but not farther down the hair shaft. If its just hair in that particular part of your head thats not curling at all from root to ends, it could just be you have different types of hair textures which some people naturally do. Im in no way a professional and this is all just based off my own personal experinces and consultations with curly hair stylistbut hopefully this helps."
whatever-I-guess,bbeggv,Following because we‚Äôre in the same boat
yoozername123,bbeggv,"Is my hair damaged? Should I cut it off again?&&&My problem basically is that while my hair doesn't really show any signs of damage on the ends (like split ends, or tapering) it is a lot straighter than the rest of my hair. The hair closer to my roots curls immediately when I moisturize, but the hair on the ends doesn't go into that definite pattern. I've tried a few different products and even the ones that make my curl gather the best still can't seem to change the ends. 

Is this a sign that it needs to be cut off? Or is it probably just the way my (and other people's) hair is? I don't have any natural family members to compare my hair to. 



Here's the backstory on my hair, if needed:

Im not really sure where to start, but like most of you growing up I constantly had relaxed hair. In my teen years I kinda fell into a depression and just completely neglected my hair. It started breaking off like crazy, even falling out in clumps when I washed it.

I wasn't really keeping up with the relaxers, so I decided to chop all of it off in near the end of 2017. Of course, when I had big chopped to just my natural hair, I still wasn't quite over the depression. Basically for the whole of 2018, I still wasn't really paying that much attention to my hair. Just washing and moisturizing when I could make myself do it (but definitely not as frequently as I should have.) I've just started to really work on it these past few months.&&&Thanks for your input! It definitely varies on different parts of my head. The speed that my hair grows varies on my head A LOT. The sections that grow faster have longer portions of straight her than the parts that grow more slowly, if that makes sense lol

It's definitely possible that those sections may be a different hair texture. It's just hard to tell right now since my hair is super short and I can't see those sections as well. Thanks again!&&&I totally forgot about hot oil treatments! I used to do them and my hair was super moisturized. Thanks for reminding me!&&&Thanks! I'll definitely try this out :)"
Chunswae22,bbbnr7,"Sounds kind of like tricotillomania. I have it, since I was a child I have ""played"" with my hair which resulted in my pulling huge amounts of my hair out. To me it's soothing and I don't realise I am actually pulling, but my hair has suffered . Many things can cause  it, mine cause is anxiety and I have aspergers syndrome so it's a formof self soothing for me."
FaerieQueef,bbbnr7,Get a fidget cube!
Purpleroyalty68,bbbnr7,I have done this for years! I break the ends  searching for split ends. I hate this . I try to keep it in protective styling or weaves to prevent me from doing this.
RWHonreddit,bbbnr7,"Bad habit of touching my hair&&&I've only been natural for a short few months now. And I guess I'm still enjoying this new texture too much. 

I swear I have my hair in my hair all day. I try to stop but I have zero self control. And I'm a uni student so I do it while I'm studying. It's finals right now and I legit end my days grabbing a few strands of my hair from my desk that accumulated over the day and throwing it away.

Help!&&&I'm breaking the ends. 

I definitely will be doing a protein treatment as soon as exams are over as I definitely do think my hair is quite weak at the moment."
WilmaVilma,bbbnr7,"I do the same thing! It‚Äôs just very comforting and nice because it‚Äôs so soft and nice.  The only thing I‚Äôve found that works is putting it up, or having something else to fiddle with."
curlyromantic,bbbnr7,"I have the same problem! I thought I was the only one. I used to have bad acne and would pop the bumps on my face CONSTANTLY. It was so bad my family and boyfriend would tell me all the time to stop if they caught me. Now since my acne is gone and I have curly hair I pull my hair all the time. It‚Äôs so comforting and eases anxiety while in class or studying. I feel so gross to my classmates because I have tiny clumps of hair I have to throw away at the end of class. Even in my car, my floor is littered with little black curls. 

It sucks so much because it makes my hair super frizzy since I touch it so much. Smh 

The only thing I was able to do to help a bit was the type of product I used. The sealant I use is so greasy when I touch my hair I just don‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt want to wash my hands all the time. Plus it makes my hair so shiny and nourished! 


The Jane carter nourish and shine will have you feeling like an insta naturalista!&&&I was just thinking try wearing a turban or a cute scarf wrap. Can‚Äôt pull your hair if it‚Äôs not there!"
himynameismaryjane,bbbnr7,"I was going to say the same thing. I got one after I finally noticed my left side of my hair is an inch shorter than the other. A little to late, but better than never."
lacefrontyard,bbbnr7,"I‚Äôm guilty of this as well. I do it absentmindedly if I‚Äôm watching tv, but I also notice I pull when I‚Äôm stressed. The only solution I‚Äôve found for myself is to just keep it wrapped when I‚Äôm doing anything that pulls my focus."
montilyetsss,bbbnr7,This is what I do a turban or if I‚Äôm working from home I keep my bonnet on.
moonchild2998,bbbnr7,"I pull at my hair AND pick my bumps although I‚Äôve kinda stopped with the bumps to play with my hair. Even when my hair is in braids I‚Äôm messing with the tensions bumps (I get them even if the braids aren‚Äôt tight). When my hair is loose, I want to mess with the single strand knots. The only thing that sort of helps is play dough. I‚Äôm so scared my edge are gonna be gone one day and my forehead is already big!"
satan_little_helper,bbbnr7,"Are you pulling out full strands or are you breaking the ends of your hair? 

If it's full strands, I wouldn't worry so much. It's your hair, and hair generally sheds about 150 strands a day, so just think of it as pre-detangling for your wash day, haha. 

If you're breaking the ends on, then that's a problem. It can definitely be onset with anxiety and stress from studying, so try to be concious of it and stop whenever you feel yourself reaching for your hair. Though if your strands are breaking so easily that they can't withstand a few days of stretching and pulling, then they are most likely very weak and you might need some protein or even moisture that's locked in with the LCO/LOC method."
ellisspotato,bb1lpe,Bangs or nah&&&I‚Äôm considering cutting bangs tomorrow. I have 3b/c hair. Any advice? Or should even bother or is it more hassle than it‚Äôs worth?
katkills,bb1lpe,I have the same curl pattern and I love mine! Originally I actually hated them because my stylist cut them straight across and I experience MAJOR shrinkage at my crown. But as they started to grow out I cut them into curtain bangs and now I'm obsessed with them.
realnyahours,bb1lpe,girlllll yesssss go for it. when i had longer hair i had micro bangs and i loved it
CopperPegasus,bax4mk,"Silk pillowcase, no bonnet... I like to maintain some pretense of sexy in my long term relationship, and I already sleep with eye shields and Vaseline :)"
M0420,bax4mk,"In all 20 years of my life I don‚Äôt think my bonnet has ever stayed on for a full night üòÇ, its better to have both but I usually go scarf or bonnet depending on how frizzy i want my hair the next day"
MisSinterpreter123,bax4mk,"I always have a satin pillow case.  Depending on the style, I may have on a bonnet or a satin scarf. If I have a WnG, just a pillowcase. When I wake up in the morning, I just fluff and go."
MondayDreamer,bax4mk,Satin pillowcases or bonnet? Pros and cons.&&&
Pasuma,bax4mk,Boffum
ShawnMarie50,bax4mk,"Satin pillowcases, I hate having something 
on my head lol."
TheYellowRose,bax4mk,"Silk pillowcase only, no bonnets"
TheseNaturalCurls,bax4mk,"Pillow case because the bonnets rub or dont stat. Even wrapping my hair, I get pulling on my edges and it's just uncomfortable. So yeah... pillow case all the way."
Wowza477,bax4mk,"I wear a satin bonnet because it keeps all my hair in one place, so it's less messy in the morning. Plus I'm a crazy sleeper so half of the time my pillow isn't where it should be when I wake up. üòÇ"
_CoachMcGuirk,bax4mk,"Where'd you buy yours? I'm open to switching to silk&&&Both. Because I enjoy my hair staying moisturized.

Cons, none."
curlyromantic,bax4mk,"I wear a bonnet, but my mom swears by a silk scarf. She says bonnets pull on your edges when you shift in your sleep. Satin pillowcases make me sweat! I hate those things."
cvkriola,bax4mk,"I use both. I feel like if I don't use the bonnet, I get more frizz. But I like the pillowcase for when the bonnet slips off or rises too high.  However I'm still on the hunt for a breathable pillowcase. I wake up with a sticky sweaty back almost every morning in the summer. I do have a spare pillow on the bed with a cotton pillowcase for when I'm too uncomfortable so I can switch."
eat_the_cake_anna,bax4mk,"I use both, satin bonnet, silk pillow case."
hippielyss,bax4mk,I prefer silk pillowcase and a silk bonnet. It keeps my hair intact better than satin.
itsKingLiz,bax4mk,"I used to wear a bonnet but recently switched to a satin pillow case because my bonnet was smooshing my stretched curls and making them shrink again. I‚Äôm a big fan of the pillow case, it helps to keep my hair stretched. I can go to sleep with my hair styled and stretch and wake up with it looking mostly the same"
lavasca,bax4mk,"Satin everything. I‚Äôm a different kind of crazy sleeper from u/Wowza477.  Anything on my head or feet get ripped off. I notice this happens even if my husband isn‚Äôt home. He does grab my hair while he sleeps.

The most I can do before bed is pigtails.

I think you‚Äôll need to rely on trial and error."
luvmypurplelipstick,bax4mk,Same here
mousemarie94,bax4mk,"Both. So when my satin head wrap comes off, I'm still on a satin fortress of pillowcases."
qblakeuk,bax4mk,I'd use satin pillowcases because sometimes i would wake up and find the silk scarf slipped off my hair that's why its best to have the pillowcase there just in case.
AmorLaluz,baw54y,Mini braids with your own hair?  Sorry I‚Äôm not much help right now.
ineverhadyourbabytom,baw54y,"Im tried of my usual natural styles what are some styles that are easy to try??&&&I've been natural for about 6+ years and I have 4c high porosity hair (and I mean HIGH she's thirsty 26/10). What are some unique styles that I can try just to spice things up I've been bored lately and not sure what else to do. I usually keep twists, then twist outs, high puffs, puffballs, the whole 9- at this point, I'm ready to try something new I've been doing bangs with my twist lately and it worked out pretty well. I can only flat twist a little and I'm trying to learn how to flat braid but it's pretty hard especially when she fights back all the time so any useful pictures or links would be great or instructions whatever you guys can give me would be a great help.
