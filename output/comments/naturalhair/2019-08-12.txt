DamaDeGatos,csb3n8,"A lot of people have a mixture of hair types on their head and to be honest, if you already know that it's Type 4, identifying the letter(s) doesn't really have an effect on the products and styling. Porosity is more important at this point. And even then, there's still trial and error in figuring out what works for you. Was there a specific reason that you wanted to seek clarification?"
MizuMoony,csb3n8,"I’d say 4c, it reminds me of my own hair"

CoffeeB4Talkie,cs8q4r,Nope. I always add a leave in.
NicoleKidmansNewChin,cs8q4r,"DAE literally wash-n-go occasionally? Wash then not add any product, oil or anything? Just to give the hair a break.&&&"
UniquelyElle97,cs8q4r,"I rarely do it just for a break, but I do it either to see if my coils are really the way they are with product (which they are 😁) & because I simply don’t feel like going through the motions."
brainsweeties,cs8q4r,Every day lol
curlsandcode,cs8q4r,"I do this but I like to throw my hair in a quick puff! I don’t do it often because i like to keep my hair stretched after washing, but sometimes I have to leave ASAP and don’t have time to do anything"
2oatmeal_cookies,cs8kpm,Omg. If I go by this chart then I have 3A to 4A. :-/ prob why my wash and gos look weird. :((((
ANZ000,cs8kpm,4a. Maybe 3c
Generic_E,cs8kpm,I'm seeing a couple of spirals so I'mma have to go with 3c 4a but your mostly 4a
HereticalBlackGirl,cs8kpm,"That's defintely nowhere near 4c, or even 4b. She's somewhere between 3b-4a."
Miinu47,cs8kpm,"What is 4a,3b,4b? Please explain."
NicoleKidmansNewChin,cs8kpm,"Does anyone know what hair type this is?&&&&&&Thanks!&&&Thank you!!&&&Thanks! 85% dry and shrunken&&&Exactly! I really think I’m an in- between type or a weird combo.  In this pic I just washed it and let it dry. There’s nothing on it. 

I like Shea moisture products. Most weeks I use their jbco shampoo then DC with the Manuka Honey Hydration Masque and wear a heating cap. That makes my hair pretty soft. 

To style I usually mix Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie with some jbco and apply a good amount of it all then two strand twist. When it’s more humid I first spray my hair with a combination of water, glycerin and lemon essential oil.

I’m surprised this combination works for me because I can’t use heavy products normally.&&&https://www.allure.com/gallery/curl-hair-type-guide&&&I didn’t think 4b or c curled up like 4a?"
bdd4,cs8kpm,Mmmmm PRETTY 😍
bless9,cs8kpm,I would say 4a. Beautiful hair
curlsandcode,cs8kpm,I would say 3c with some 4a possibly
iamyiyaj,cs8kpm,maybe 4a/b or just 4a
ileim,cs8kpm,I have a similar hair type to you! I’d say its 4a/3c. Maybe some 4b.

knight_ofdoriath,cs8kpm,You have the same type as mine! I think it’s some sort of Frankenstein’s monster of 3c/4a depending of the location in my scalp. What do you use on it?
leeleep93,cs8kpm,"Looks like its multiple textures. From like a 3c-4b, front to the back"
lemontimes2,cs8kpm,4a or 4b
nicestshawtyalive,cs8kpm,"MINE.

jk. this looks a lot like my hair and I consider myself 3c/4a."
queenofeeveerything,cs8kpm,I would say more 4b/4c. But hair type is less important these days since you can have multiple types all over your head. I would also test on density/porosity
sapphireruby_,cs8kpm,4b/4a
yeslesss,cs8kpm,Def 4a/4b. Beautiful curl pattern! Is your hair wet in this pic? Or dry and shrunken?
CoffeeB4Talkie,cs67t0,"I did it ONE time out of curiosity. It's not for my low porosity hair, that's for sure. LOL"
FAMURattler85,cs67t0,I tried it one day and that was too much protein for my hair.
Wildly-Mundane,cs67t0,"Do you think its because Traeh has low porosity hair (I don't watch Natural Reign so i know nothing about her)? Traeh herself said she should've only used it once a month not 5 days a week and that she wasn't knocking it but she's annoyed her hair was breaking.

But I agree, the 5 day results are probably, 5 days of any protein treatment will break off your hair"
jherijohnson,cs67t0,"Rice Water for Hair Growth&&&What are your thoughts on rice water for growing long thick hair?

Have you actually measured your results?

Do you think the 5 day results youtubers post are real?&&&Thank you for your input, did it make your hair feel hard?&&&Great point! Thank you for your input!&&&Thanks for sharing"
marcellaokayy,cs67t0,Pretty sure those 5 day results are a scam. IAMTRAEH and Natural Reign both got protein overload. Rice protein is pretty strong. I wouldn't try to do this at home tbh. If your hair isn't damaged you don't need to do protein treatments anyway. Most products have enough protein in them already
2oatmeal_cookies,cs0db6,"It’s brittle (maybe high porosity) or dehydrated (low porosity)?  You should find something for your hair porosity. 

I have 4a/4b hair. My ends are highly porous from the way my hair stylist used heat on my hair. My roots are low porous. It’s also been a struggle finding a good product while I slowly cut the damaged hair off. I use Mielle products & I deep condition & steam my hair every week."
CoffeeB4Talkie,cs0db6,"Haven't tried that line. I gave up on Shea Moisture years ago.

I do like The Mane Choice and Kinky-Curly. 

P.S. The Mane Choice has a sale going on right now on their website if anyone is interested."
Curlzonfleek,cs0db6,"I’ve never used the blue Shea moistures label but the yellow/mustard color line from Shea moistures was my jam when I first stopped using heat. I used their deep conditioner and the conditioner as leave in with their pink label product. Now I just use the Aussie 3 min deep treatment and add olive oil to it, put a processing cap on and sit under the dryer for 30 min. Hope this helps&&&Also start thinking about your protective styles, the oils you’re going to be moisturizing with and ensuring your products don’t have alcohol."
FAMURattler85,cs0db6,I’m 3c/4a low porosity and use TGIN Honey Miracle Hair Mask or Mielle Mongogo Oil Protein-Free Hydrating Conditioner. Works wonders for my dry hair!! I also use Mielle Pomegranate & Honey Leave in >AsIAm So Much Moisture > seal with a black castor oil (a little goes a long way).
JustLurkingHereMan,cs0db6,"I heard that those two products weren't all that moisturizing for some people's hair. Although, I recommend getting that deep conditioner from the same line OR the manuka honey line. For shampoo and conditioner, I recommend the TGIN line (the ones in the black bottles). Aussie moist is also a good conditioner with good slip.

On the higher end of the spectrum, I've used DevaCurl low-poo shampoo and it was AMAZING for moisture!"
Preshylust,cs0db6,Shea Moisture is kinda whack. I’m loving Mielle Organics right now. I also like Camille Rose.
black_beautytlc,cs0db6,I don't know about the shampoo but the conditioner and treatment have protein so if you're protein sensitive this  line would not be good for you.
chemeralart,cs0db6,"I like Shea moisture, but I've been using the Cantu do kids curling cream and I'm impressed"
itsrik9,cs0db6,"Shea Moisture in general is a great brand for natural hair! If you are looking for moisture, the Manila Honey and Mafuro Oil (brown/gold containers) one is the most hydrating. That’s what I use for my deep conditioning, and my hair always feels amazing afterward."
jammysue,cs0db6,"Yes. They work really good! I use the protien mask and it works amazing. Also, try the jbco line."
jazzylicious1993,cs0db6,New to natural hair ! Would you guys recommend these products?

I Aussie products right now I’m using the moist line conditioner and shampoo I definitely need to add a deep conditioner and leave in to my regimen and was also thinking of getting a dryer since winters coming up&&&Just an update I bought it and used. It tonight it’s amazing and only $3 thanks for the great recommendation!!&&&Aussie is always amazing hehe I’ll give it a try do you just do the 3 mins as recommended?  Or do you leave in for an hour or 2  or overnight?&&&I’m still trying to find out mine but my hair takes a long time to get wet in the shower idk if that’s high or low&&&Ok that’s awesome to know thanks I was gunna get the hibiscus deep conditioner I’ll try that one first instead!&&&Well I believe that’s just normal conditioner ..do a lot of people replace regular conditioner with deep conditioner?&&&I have no idea if I’m proteins sensitive is t protein supposed to help with breakage ? Cuz I’m struggling with that hard core
marcellaokayy,cs0db6,"Mielle Organics pomegranate line saved my hair. You should check it out. There's no deep conditioner with it though, but I use the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey mask instead."
nykstr,cs0db6,I liked the shampoo for a hydrating cleaning but used a different deep conditioner.
wesmellthecolor9,cs0db6,"Aussie 3 min deep conditioner is a life saver and super cheap. If you take anything out of this thread, buy that."

freestyle45,crt48v,"To mini chop or not?&&&I have 4c hair that ranges from shoulder length - BSL in some places.  As of late, it has been extremely dry and rough to the touch.  I lose handfuls of hair every wash day.  This has been going on for the past year or so, and is mostly due to my depression  - I struggle to find the energy to do my hair (and most things).  I try to keep a regular schedule, but eventually I fall off. 

I have switched from commercial products to homemade products and back again, but nothing seems to make my hair feel moisturized anymore.  

I was looking at my hair this weekend and while I have a lot of it, and I know some would kill to have my length of hair, I can't stand how damaged it feels.  I was looking through pictures of my hair when it was shorter and my hair looks much healthier. 

Would it be worth doing a mini-chop? Or should I try getting a protective style for a few months to see if that improves the health of my hair?"
thatsameawkwardgirl,crt48v,"Maybe chopping some would be great. For me right now, the biggest issue is my ends. They're dusty and dry and is messing up my hair in every aspect. When you chop off those dead ends your hair will automatically feel much healthier! And don't worry, your hair will always be growing!

As far as depression, I understand how you feel completely. I've been neglecting my hair too i don't even have any products right now except for shampoo and castor oil. And my hair looks a mess. It's been like this for like a week. I don't want to do it but in my subconscious I do. I just can't find any will or motivation to do so.

I don't take meds for it, I heard meds can make your hair fall out but that's not the reason I don't take it. I'd take the hairloss anyday. But anyway, there's nothing I can say to make it magically go away. Stress is inevitable and is always happening and it will never go away. So best I can say is to take care of it as best as you can in your position. That's what I do.

But I hope things get better for you, I really do.

If you wanna ask me anything else feel free to. :)"

HeyItsKimberlee,crrxik,I tried a bronze one and really liked it! It did leak on my shirt though when I was working out but other than that I enjoyed it!
NsideDaNsideda,crrxik,"I have the orange and gold.  They give the look of lifting my hair color without the damage.  I typically use it on an old WNG.  

I have some samples of the Crown Hair Paint and I don't like that as much.  I used it as directed - she says you're supposed to use it on dry hair - and it makes my hair frizzy.  The next time I try it, I'll use it on wet hair."
leeleep93,crrxik,"I have. The red one, it's really nice and easy to put on. I usually do wash and gos so after I put my gel in I add the wax. The more you add the more vibrant. It's also really easy to wash out. My only problem is how it smells, but it starts to go away after a while"

I used my clarifying shampoo last weekend because I realized I hadn't in months, and I blowdried my hair for the first time after being natural for years now.

My mom was puerto rican and most my black aunts just straighten their hair, so I never really learned from them. I feel like I’ve watched every youtube video there is to watch and I still have trouble with finding a good routine and styling my hair properly! 

I’ve been contemplating just cutting it really short and wearing it like that because it would be easier and short styles are really cute, but every time I schedule an appointment I chicken out last minute because I don’t want to lose all my growth. I know I’d probably like it short and it would be so much easier to have it like that, but I look at social
media and everyone seems to have the nicest natural hair, in big afros and things like that, and it makes me second guess wanting to cut it. 

Should I just stick with it and keep trying, or should I just cut it? I really want to take care of it but I just can’t seem to figure out how :/."
