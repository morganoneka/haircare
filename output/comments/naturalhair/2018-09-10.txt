BeatrixQuix,9gcpxj,Deep conditioning with heat on a weekly basis perhaps
Callmedada__,9gcpxj,"Someone, please help me get my curls back!&&&Hello! I am a 20 year old black male, I have 3c high porosity hair and my hair/ scalp gets dry extremely fast. I had an ex that had washed my hair for me and it had been the thickest my hair had ever been and I loved it. I've tried figuring out how I can do it the same way but haven't been able to get the same product (I cant ask her because we left on really bad terms). My scalp gets really dry if I don't wash/condition my hair more than 2 days, My hair has no curls whatsoever in the middle of my head and it gets dry really fast. I've tried protein treatments and they help but its temporary. I deep condition pretty often, and I just don't know what else I have to do to get my hair to it's fullest potential. Please someone help!"

Dahliacid,9g6z0w,Try investing in better shears. I learned the hard way when I used cheap ones. 
animousity692,9g6z0w,"I saved at least $40&&&I badly needed a trim. There are hardly any salons in my area that are adept at natural hair unless you go out of the way. I tried to go back to the salon that gave me a deva cut (overrated). They tried to tell me it was $85 for a TRIM. No.

So I bought a pair of hair cutting shears for $5 and did it my damn self. Feels great! Why haven’t I tried this sooner??&&&What hard way??"
jojojjn,9g6z0w,I did the same thing cuz i couldn't find anyone in my area who could cut my hair. Had my sis initially cut it short but I didn't like the shape so I just went ham on it and started chopping away. I like it now :) Sometimes doing it yourself is the only way.

skyepie39,9foa3x,"Rain in Vancouver&&&Hi everyone!
I just moved to Vancouver from Cape Town. I’m very nervous about my 3c/4a hair in this climate/mostly it reacting to the rain. My current routine involves monthly ACV rinses (or whenever my hair needs it), bi-weekly oil (usually argan, olive mix) treatments, detangling with whatever conditioner I have on hand, DC with Aussie DC, Cantu styling creme and raking some gel in. I try to be low maintenance and prefer having my hair out, but since moving I’ve relied on protective styles. 
I guess I’d like some insider tips on how fellow naturals deal with this Pacific Northwest climate, and if anyone has managed to keep a wash n go longer than 2 days? How?

Additionally - are there any good stores in the Vancouver area that stock good/diverse products? Or should I just stick with amazon?"
Baradiche,9fo6tz,"Am I doing this wrong?&&&My dad always says my hair looks dirty and I wash it once a week. It may be due to a product I'm using that's white, though. He says I need to oil it. I put oil on it two days ago. Even after I washed it, he said it looked dusty. And he says I need to comb all the way through it; I usually comb to decrease tangles but not to make it tangle free because of fear of breakage. Should I not use the white product that I use for moisturization, should I oil my hair everyday, should I detangle all of my hair?&&&4 naturals curl creme. It doesnt actually make my hair curl. i just use enough to coat the hair. Nothing else for daily moisturization. I just use a wide tooth comb. I deep condition once a week too. Occasionally use oils. Also, don't you lose alot of hair from breakage? My hair is only a few inches so i cant do protective styles and im forced to comb it everyday which probably eats up length."
Dahliacid,9fo6tz,U need moisturizing creams. Curl creams just enhance curl patterns 
LordAsbel,9fo6tz,"Quick question cuz my dad does the same thing....


Does your dad have hair? If he doesn’t, ignore everything he has to say because that’s what I’ve been doing"
ladyAnder,9fo6tz,"I'm going to jump in here and say that the color of the product shouldn't matter. Most are white in color.

I would use a clarifying shampoo instead of your normal shampoo on wash day because that sounds like product build up. A clarifying shampoo should get rid of any residue. 

I wouldn't use a curl creme daily. Since your hair is so short, a leave in conditioner or a daily hair moisturizer with an oil would be a lot better. Heck you might even get away with just water and oil.

Also, you want to apply product using the LOC method or LCO.  Liquid, oil, and conditioner or liquid, conditioner, and oil. 

So basically, you want to do something like this: Water, daily conditioner, and oi of your choice. "
n_kaye,9fo6tz,"What is the white product? How much of it are you using? Do you use anything else with it? 

And yes you should detangle all the way. I start with my fingers, then a wide tooth comb, then a denman brush. "

dackeriah,9f5vvt,"4 inches!!!&&&So I cut 4 whole inches off my hair because my ends were dead and I was terrified. Now I've just been protective styling and conditioning and what not, but I just took my hair down from my protective style after a week and conditioned it and what not and now for some odd reason my hair feels horrible and I'm really worrying. Like it feels crazy and my curls aren't popping like they were before I cut it. I'm going crazy lol&&&I actually found out what the problem was lol, so I hadn't washed my hair in like two to three weeks and that's how my hair responds to product build up but I didn't know because that was my first time experiencing product build up lol.

I'm looking for something close to my hair texture, 3c, do you all have any cheaper recommendations, that are a little more quality??

BeatrixQuix,9etx4j,"out of curiosity, why are you  not wetting your hair? If you're a natural getting your hair wet is fine and helps facilitate the absorbtion of oils and product that you're using in your hair.  Every day i use use water+leave in to detangle and part my hair before bed,also cuts down on shedding and for me (i'm an undeniable  4c) has helped define my curl pattern.&&&Also invest in a really really good leave-in. Shea Moisture has a Shea and Flaxseed oil one that's really good or make yr own with honey, olive oil, coconut oil, flax seed and Shea. You might get a little sticker shock paying upwards of 10.00 or more for a little bottle of leave in but it has made a huge difference in my routine. Stay away from the queen Helene unless you're gonna doctor it lol. "
TigerLilySea,9etx4j,Okay so I de tangle in the shower and comb it out under running water. Then section it and twist those while wet. Then I dry my hair a little so it's not sopping wet and then let it air dry for a bit at the scalp because my hair takes forever to dry. Then I unbraid each section and moisturize/product comb a bit then braid. Usually that helps. 
aretha_banklin,9etx4j,"Sounds like you might need a trim. I cut mine recently and that cut my detangling process by 2/3. No dry, split or damaged ends tangling up on each other. 

If your hair has recently been trimmed, I would try tension blow-drying. I make sure I get the roots so it's easy to part how I need. 

If you aren't interested in using heat, try curlformers. When I'm going to have my hair braided I usually throw them in so my hair gets very very cleanly stretched from root to end. No need to blow-dry and styling afterward is painless. Gamechanger, no exaggeration. 

Hope this helps!"
dawn-21,9etx4j,"How to THOROUGHLY detangle (and prep) hair for braids and flat twists?&&&I've been natural for a bit over 2 years now, but since I literally started from scalp length, for a large portion of that time, I didn't really need to do styles like flat twists as long I did the usual to avoid tangles. Now that my hair has gotten longer, I always try and keep my hair away from water unless I need to wash it, sleep on a silk pillowcase (and a sleeping cap for good measure), sectioning it into 4 sections before going to sleep,  etc etc to help avoid as many tangles as possible. I always mostly just finger detangle and maybe use combs only on wash day when I get my hair wet, but lately found that this isn't quite enough for preparing for braids and other maniplated styles of that sort. Even when I use my denman comb with all the the slip in the world, my hair always has some sort of tangle at least at the base of my scalp, and it's so frustrating. I think the closest I ever got to being nearly fully detangled enough for braiding was a few months back when I got my hair blown out professionally by a stylists and that was after hours of painful brushing with a paddle brush and endless clips and sectioning after a wash and deep condition.

&#x200B;

I recently watched some videos from natural hair youtubers in order to learn how to braid and flat twist my own hair, but the way their hair acts seems to different from mine that it makes me frustrated that I don't know what I'm doing wrong. For example, I've been watching videos from Kopano the Blog and she can part her hair anywhere without much issue, and can also braid her hair without having to stop often to detangle.

&#x200B;

Am I doing something wrong? Are there people with hair that just really takes a long time to detangle? Do I just need to accept that I need to spend half an entire day JUST to detangle my hair? I'm just quite frustrated because I'm going to be going to be studying abroad for a while and I want to learn how to deal with my hair myself --- black hair stylists aren't exactly cheap in Japan.

&#x200B;

ANY help would be appreciated! Thanks so much in advance!&&&I haven't gotten a trim since the last time I visited the salon, so I'm probably overdue lol. I think I'll try that and see if it changes much for me. Thanks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;&&&Yea I do this already and I agree working with my hair when it's a bit more dry is just unreasonable lol. 

&#x200B;

How big are your sections though?  and how many on your head in total? Also, how long is your hair might I ask?&&&I actually typically comb with a denman under running water in the shower. Maybe I don't get down to my roots properly? not sure.

&#x200B;

Anyway, thanks a lot. I'll be sure to keep your advice in mind.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

edit: Also I watched that video from Chizi a long time ago and tried it myself, but unlike her my hair is low porosity, so it doesn't absorb water as easily as her, so my hair doesn't really detangle itself like hers in water unfortunately. It really bummed me out cause I discovered I had low porosity through her video LOL.&&&Sounds similar to my own process, but I typically dry it overnight, so maybe that's my issue and I should do it while it's still a bit damp. I'm also starting to think it might have to do with maybe how I comb my own hair lol. If it snags too much, I put the comb down and detangle with my hands then use the comb again, but that seems to take too much time.&&&Sorry, I think I didn't phrase that well. I DO get my hair, but I don't get it wet without having it stretched first or having it in sections so it doesn't shrink all the way back up. I don't get it wet when I'm wearing my hair out (when  it's not in some sort of stretched style) because my hair is so thick it becomes a hassle if I don't lol.

&#x200B;

When you do that every night, do you finger detangle or do you use a comb?&&&I have 4c, so I'm not sure how much your method will work for me, but I plan on utilizing some of your advice anyway. Thanks a lot!"
gggggrrrrrrrrr,9etx4j,"To entirely prepare my hair for braids is typically about a 24 hour process. I start by washing it with conditioner, putting a little product with slip in it, thoroughly combing it while wet, and braiding it in one or two sections. Then I wait til it dries (at least overnight), gently finger comb out any lingering tangles, rebraid it in a couple sections, and wait a few hours. The end result is hair that is untangled, fairly smooth, and easy to braid.

For some reason, the end result is far different when I do my detangling with wet hair instead of dry. If I try just taking out all tangles when my hair is dry, it takes forever and the hair feels stiff, coarse, and fairly unmanageable. I'm not sure if my method will work for you, but it's worth a try."
glodoll,9etx4j,"First, you should be getting a trim at least twice per year (at least an inch each time). Sure, you might lose length but it's worth it if you want longer, healthier hair in the long run. And it'll definitely be easier to detangle, especially the ends.

What works for me when I want to braid is I wash my hair making sure to detangle in the shower with a wide tooth comb while my conditioner is in. Then later, while my hair is still damp, I'll put hair product, like hair lotion, so it stays moisturized. I'll put the hair lotion in each of the four divided sections and I'll comb it till it's not tangled anymore. Then I'll blow dry small sections for every fourth section, while doing the comb and chase method. After that, the hair will usually not get tangled again. After that I just braid, adding in gel.

What hair pattern do you have? I have 3c, so I don't know if my method will work for you.

whatkathy,9etx4j," You need a Denman brush or the cheap $2.99 version from your local beauty supply by [Annie](http://www.samsbeauty.com/service/Annie-Rubber-Cushion-Brush-g-ARCSAMS.html) (the link is $1.00!!). How you detangle your hair matters. A year+ ago, there was a natural hair trend to have your husband wash your hair. I thought that was absolutely CRAZY bc it took me hours, so how could a man with zero experience do it?? Search up the tag My Husband Wash My 4c Hair / Natural Hair. I shortened my wash time by hours after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5ZAGeqRy2U), *using the flow of water to your benefit changes* **everything**.  
  
If you have serious detangling to do (ie old braids): Dampen, not soak, you hair with water. Section your hair into manageable portions. Work conditioner into a section, then starting from tip to root comb out you hair with the Denman brush (or the knockoff). Don't overthink it, that'll lead u to working with too small of sections.  
  

(Kopano the Blog most likely detangles off camera and does a small bit during the process you see.)"
jalisew,9erq56,"Products&&&My hair is REALLYYYY THICK but I have type 4 hair I think mostly 4b. It will be a year on September 17. I haven’t straightened my hair at all. One time I tried to blow dry my hair but FAIL ‼️  I dyed it 2  No bleach tho  the last time it didn’t take for some reason maybe it was light. But 

I want my curls defined with products and for my hair to feel moisturized. People always say it’s soft but that doesn’t satisfy me 😐 

Any tips or products (maybe in the affordable range)"
