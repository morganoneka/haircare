Ace_Turnip,a6j0sa,"Is scab hair a real thing?&&&Ive been natural for 5 years and my hair's around armpit length except for my crown. My crown refuses to grow past 1-2 inch in length. Ive tried everything. That area also starts itching like crazy 5 days after I wash my hair.

Anyway I visited a hair salon for an assessment,since the dermatologist told me theres nothing wrong w my scalp (I dont believe her). The stylist told me the hair in the crown is thin, broken and raggedy because it's scab hair. The scab hair is apparently a result of a congested scalp due to excess skin on the scalp. 

I didnt find any information on this online and I cant judge for myself since i cant see my own scalp. But is there really such a thing?&&&It's been six years since my last relaxer and I only wear box braids/twists once a year. You mean it takes ten years for hair to grow properly?

If it helps, my mom said I had ringworm in the back of my head when I was little (im 21 now). She said the ringworm couldve migrated to the crown&&&Wow it's such a shame... have you visited a dermatologist? I speculate that since for a lot of us, the hair in our crown area is completely different in terms of hair texture (hair type, porosity, thickness and fine vs course), that it probably requires different type of haircare. But we just don't know what kind of haircare exactly. &&&You mean with mouthwash? When would you do the rinse?"
BooBootheFool22222,a6j0sa,"i have a super hard time with my crown but only on the left side. it tangles even more than the rest of my hair and i'm not sure why.

i always thought ""scab hair"" was an euphemism for damaged hair follicles caused by lye and that some follicles never return to normal, especially if you were relaxed your entire childhood."
Starwhisperer,a6j0sa,Your scalp was probably traumatized before. This is a result. Give it five more years and it will start growing a bit longer. My hair on my edges are the same way. 
_CoachMcGuirk,a6j0sa,"I don't think that's a real thing but I do think it could be genetics or previous damage to the scalp.

At least that's what I attribute my crown struggles to :(

I don't believe it'll come back in 5 years, I've been struggling with this for 15+ years.

quaglady,a6j0sa,"You might want to do a Listerine rinse. I have ""scab hair"" on the back of my head, and using it has cut way down on the breakage. For a while it was breaking off almost at the root."

AllThatGlitt3rs,a6ieax,It‚Äôs mainly about how you take care of the hair and making sure you don‚Äôt over wear the style. 
sayoco231,a6ieax,Is it possible to get individual crochet braids without damaging my hair/edges?&&&I want to get a short collar bone length style with box braids because I want to give my hair a break from styling. I was wondering if getting crochet braids individually installed would damage my hair more or less than using the cornrow method.
AllThatGlitt3rs,a6hb4k,I feel like there is definitely a concern of tension with box braids. Why not try crochet braids? Ensure to tell them not too tight. 
BrieAlysse,a6hb4k,"Do you haaaaaavvvvvve to get it braided? Like what‚Äôs the reason behind needing the braids?

I had a terrible experience the 1 time I got my hair braided as a natural. My hair was ripped out and I had so much breakage and damage. Never again. "
FriendlyShark24,a6hb4k,Me üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôve just put faux locks in and am so stressed about and kind of tension I can feel.  I don‚Äôt think my braids are tight but I‚Äôm still a bit paranoid!!
Port64,a6hb4k,"I had a similar experience to OP. I found a good stylist who specializes in natural hair health. She also happens to do braided styles but her main focus is health of your hair. She asked me why I wanted braids and I told her the same thing... protective style, ease of styling, etc. She is recommending we start with styles on my hair first then maybe transition to braided styles or other styles with added hair. Is there a shop near you that could do 2 strand twists? I had that done and it lasted me a bit over 2 weeks. "
carmieeee,a6hb4k,"I‚Äôve been wearing Marley Twists off and on for the past 4-5 months and I do them myself. I taught myself how to do these styles because I don‚Äôt want others putting too much tension on my scalp. I don‚Äôt wear them tight and because I do them myself, I can retwist, freshen up, etc. as needed. There are so many YouTube tutorials from people who do it as a living. I would suggest watching these videos and paying great attention to detail but also keeping in mind that you don‚Äôt have to twist to the root or as closely to the root with these styles. Do what you have to do to keep your hair healthy. 

Edit: it‚Äôs possible to wear low tension twists and braids without it looking a mess FYI lol 

Finding good and properly detailed YouTube videos is like doing research. It takes time but you will be rewarded once you find a few that you like. I can PM you some if you want."
lakija,a6hb4k,"Tell your stylist DON‚ÄôT do tight braids on the front. Be bold. It‚Äôs your hair. If they‚Äôre going to be your stylist you tell them what you need. Or find someone else. 

Don‚Äôt be scared of a style. Find someone you trust. "
thatonka,a6hb4k,"Terrified of getting my hair braided&&&Does anyone else have an illogical fear of getting their hair braided? The last time I braided my hair ( more than a year ago) my hairline was obliterated , I went to the dermatologist and he told me that all hair styles that pull at the hairline will lead to hair loss no matter what. Now my hair is growing and my hairline is healthy,  I don't know what to do with it because I am terrified of getting it braided.  My hair looks a mess right now and I can't seem to get over this fear.&&&I don't  know what else to do with it honestly.  I have tried to do some youtube styles but they end up looking terrible on me (I am pretty useless at hair styling) . I now just do a wash and go every morning but I just need variation.

25_timesthefine,a6d9wy,"I love the matcha conditioner but holy fuck it‚Äôs almost $40 for a jar of it. It really does condition the hair, and it‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve used from the line. "
DaisyDej,a6d9wy,"I‚Äôve been using their line for a year now. I am 4b/c as well. Because it is expensive, I buy their products from Ulta so I can get points and use those points towards future purchases.  I use decadence conditioner, melt into moisture, and curl stretcher regularly. I don‚Äôt love their gel for hold, I‚Äôd rather use their super cream for soft but defined curls. But I prefer the curl stretcher to the super cream. I don‚Äôt love their products for a twist out. However, I will mix decadence condition and water in a spray bottle to touch up my twist outs. "
Port64,a6d9wy,"What I‚Äôve heard is that you have to use all of the products together for it to work. In my experience, even though my hair is type 4, the decadence line didn‚Äôt work for me because my hair is not porous and the protein in the Decadence line made it hard. I did not have any troubles with the regular line. If you are used to using an eco styler type gel you won‚Äôt find that type of hold with the ultra defining gel. When I got a devacut she used a styling cream and one of the gels and it came out nicely. I think the arc angel gel actually has more hold than the ultra defining gel.  If you go to Sephora you can ask for a sample so you don‚Äôt have to spend more money to try it. 

Everyone‚Äôs hair is different so what didn‚Äôt work for someone else may work for you! Try the line together and try it several times. There is a learning curve with Deva Curl and how to use the products and from what I have heard from others is that it takes a little time for your hair to adjust to DevaCurl especially if you‚Äôve used products that are heavy, that have  silicones, if you have buildup etc. Hope you enjoy it!"
PossiblyWitty,a6d9wy,"I like the regular line. Decadence left too much buildup in my hair and made it sticky. The gel didn‚Äôt work for me, but the supercream is amazing. I‚Äôve used all their products together, but I think you can mix and match as long as the other products you‚Äôre using are CG friendly and don‚Äôt contain sulfates. I also stopped using oils for the most part because they made my hair feel slick but never moisturized. I follow evanjosephcurls on ig and he talks about why we shouldn‚Äôt use oils. I started using NYC curls on his recommendation and I find it works really well with certain devacurl products. "
carmieeee,a6d9wy,"Doing DevaCurl Patch Test ‚Äî What are you all‚Äôs thoughts on this brand? This is my first time trying it and I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things minus the cost. The travel size bottle (3mL) of ultra defining gel cost me $10. Is it worth the cost in your opinion? FYI I‚Äôm a solid 4b/c.&&&&&&I just did a patch test on my 4b/c hair last night using ONLY the ultra defining gel and my hair came out really nice. I had already washed it using Shea Moisture‚Äôs Coconut and Hibiscus Line and moisturized with Cantu (I know I shouldn‚Äôt use Cantu but I wasn‚Äôt near my other products lol). I wanna by the holiday super curly kit now. It‚Äôs $20 for four minis: gel, buildup buster, detangler, and leave in.&&&I only used the ultra defining gel last night as a patch test and my hair came out soft and super defined. I didn‚Äôt use the creams or anything else. "
foxxa121,a6d9wy,"Not impressed for the price, I also purchased a 3pce travel set from Ulta. Gel, Decadence, can‚Äôt remember the third item. There are so many great products that are more affordable. Miss Jessie‚Äôs, As I Am, ORS, African Pride.  Forgot to say my hair is definitely in the 4 range, and super thick!!"
latisha05,a6d9wy,I LOVE the Super Curly line. I have 3c/4a hair and the shampoo and conditioner makes a major difference.  I like to also buy the products from Ulta so I can receive points. 
thenorthremembers987,a6d9wy,The big one is on sale at amazon right now for $50 :). I swooped it up for $30 during cyber Monday week! 
Beanflag,a6d3h1,"How long should my hair be for synthetic box braids?&&&(Cross-posted from Blackhair)

Hi, guys. I'm considering doing a big(ish) chop of my hair since it's so badly damaged, but I know how bad I will look with hair so short, so I want to get box braids while I'm growing it back. What's the shortest I can cut it, and still be able to get box braids? I'm thinking of cutting my hair as much as I can every time I take the braids out, until it's all healthy. Suggestions and information appreciated."
The90sarevintage,a6d3h1,"Hi! I big chopped to 3 inches or so and it was fine - I just made sure to blow it out carefully because I am tender headed. Pretty much as long as there is enough hair to attach a braid you‚Äôre good. I did notice that when my hair was shorter they would try to braid in all my edges just an fyi

Edit: I went between box braids and crochet box braids to change the tension between my hair and now after two years I‚Äôm at bra strap "
carmieeee,a6d3h1,As long as it‚Äôs not shaved it should be fine. A good 2-3 inches is perfect.

Ace_Turnip,a67mkf,ORS naturals buttercream leave in&&&Anybody try this product? If so what did you think?
PinkPurse12,a666wv,Without a boar brush I couldn't get hair to look neat or distribute product in hair evenly. Because I have 4c hair its a must for me. My hair is very long and doing well and Ive been using boar brush my whole life so I say its fine.
TuffTitti,a666wv,"nothing wrong with it, especially if it works for you! I tend to prefer nylon paddle brushes for my fine but thick hair ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
chapine,a666wv,"Is brushing with a soft bristle brush bad?&&&Hello! I am transitioning and after a wash, I put in the Hawaiian Silky and an oil mix and thread my hair. I don't comb my hair at all because if I comb it wet, then the relaxed hair falls off. If I comb it dry, my natural hair and the relaxed hair get super tangled. I have found that brushing with a gentle brush while my hair is damp with the oil and Hawaiian Silky works best to detangle for me. I typically will wear my hair threaded for a week and moisturize with the Hawaiian Silky and oil throughout the week. 


I never really thought about it until I saw an old friend who brushes out her curls She's white and her hair is just sooooo frizzy, but she likes it that way. I know that black women never really brush their hair unless it's with a Denman brush, but I feel like they are too rough for me. I want to know if what I'm doing is super damaging to my curl pattern or the hair in any way. I have 4c hair and maybe like half a centimeter of new growth!&&&OMG! Yes, mine is nylon but has a lot of bristles and they're very soft. My hair is also fine and thick. A kindred spirit! What curl pattern do you have?&&&Thank you for the insight! I also have 4c hair! Do you brush your scalp in a circle? I know some people use the boar brush to promote hair growth but I'm reluctant to try it on my edges because they're sooooooo sparse. "
BrieAlysse,a611vv,"I don‚Äôt use heated caps but they are all over amazon.com ! I do however recommend a soft bonnet as a previous comment said. I use the Softhood Hair Dryer attachment.

You can put it on your blow dryer and there is a strap that goes under your chin and a drawstring that you can use to tighten it so it doesn‚Äôt fall off your head. It works great for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments. "
Sharbubbles972,a611vv,Recommendation for Heat Caps for Deep Conditioning Days&&&Hello! Does anybody have a recommended heated cap for deep conditioning days? I am looking at amazon for a microwaveable one... the expensive one had mixed reviews... the cheaper one has mixed reviews. Any advice is verywelcome! !
SweetTea1621,a611vv,I like my Hot Head cap!
TayBaby17,a611vv,"I don‚Äôt know about the heated caps, but have you thought about a soft bonnet dryer? They‚Äôre super cheap and you can deep condition in 20-25 min and you can use it for setting roller sets, twist outs, flexirods, etc. "
foxxa121,a611vv,"I got a no name brand from Amazon, microwaveable. Works great, however before I did that what works awesome is. Using a turban soaked in hot water. Marshall‚Äôs and TJMaxx sells the drying turbans, usually in a 2-pack.
After applying your deep conditioner, put on a plastic bag. Then wrap the hot turban around your hair, put another bag on top. Works great !!! I did this for about s year before buying the cap. Great when traveling for long periods of time too."
keto_name0529,a611vv,I have a GoldNHot soft bonnet dryer and that thing is great for deep conditioning and for drying set styles where time is an issue.
Jazzers88,a5mhaz,"Heat Damage&&&My friend recently straighten her hair and now half of her hair won‚Äôt revert properly. I literally watched her do the process and she did all the tips suggested:
- Deep Condition
- Protein Treatment 
- Heat Protectant
- Used products with hydrolyzed  wheat protein 
- keep the flat iron at 300 degrees
- only did one pass through then curled the ends for body after straightening all of her hair on 280 degrees

So we don‚Äôt understand why she still got heat damage. Any ideas? "
spntuesday,a5mhaz,"Honestly some heat affects everyone‚Äôs hair differently. But I‚Äôd also recommend a moisturizing deep conditioner, as your friend may have loaded up on protein before hand."
sqwzmahmeatybts,a5mhaz,"I agree that there's literally no way to know until you try. I've been too afraid to straighten more than 1 time per year, but some people do it 4-6 times per year without an issue.

&#x200B;

So, it could have been the specific way your friends hair reacts. I didn't see what temperature they used either, that could have a lot to do with it too."
wildhuntressophelia,a5mhaz,I also agree with this. Sometimes it's not really heat damage maybe the curls got a little lazy and heavy after all that protein so maybe she should just switch to a protein free regimen and maybe after a couple washes and deep conditioning sessions it will get back to normal.
BooBootheFool22222,a5lenl,"i used to use a twist/lock heavy dressing that was like a cream but heavier like it had oil in it from dark n lovely. they may have discontinued it because this was back when dark n lovely only had that dark brown/copper packaging. i never had any problems with flaking using this, 
now i don't use a gel at all. i only use gel for my edges or slicking back my hair for a ponytail. 

i use castor oil or aphogee gloss polisher or cantu's anti-fade/color oil.
castor oil really defines my twists. even if i only use cantu's leave in repair cream but put castor oil on the tip of the completed twist, the twist pattern is really defined when i wear a twist out. but it only lasts because i twist my hair again before bed.

usually clear oil-like serums designed to fight frizz (L'oreal has one i want to try) preserve twists or perm rod curls by not letting water in."

BooBootheFool22222,a529jm,"what do you mean by ""coarse""? we need so much more info &&&oh yeah OP, i thought my hair was ""coarse"" but it turns out i had low porosity and water either immediately left my hair in dry air or was immediately taken in by my hair in humid air. i feel like this is what's happening IF the health of your hair is good.

I recently found out the non-black oriented (i've used tresemme) brands' anti-frizz products work well if you don't want the super oiliness of straight up oils but oils in general seal the cuticle and keep moisture from getting in. 

another good gloss/serum is aphogee gloss polisher. heavier products (like thick cream consistency) by shea moisture and cantu weigh the hair down which is a good thing if you have high porosity or "
