GAaliyah12,jdrag4,It has taken me about 1 year to learn to twist and actually take care of my natural hair. At first I never did anything to it.
Mindfreak4200,jdrag4,How long did it take you to be able to do you hair?&&&Just looking for realistic expectations and hopefully a pick me up because I’ve been natural for two years and still can’t do my hair. :(
PigmentedLady,jdrag4,"I've been natural all my life. Started doing my own at 13. 

A pony tail for ex would take around 5 to 10 minutes for me. I also have a lot of hair. But i am able to master quick styles."
guyanap,jdrag4,I’ve been doing my own hair (natural) since I was eleven and still can’t do my hair lol. Im 20 now btw
0423beatface,jdqsvt,"Vibin’ on Saturday&&&&&&I almost always exclusively protective style, but occasionally I let my actual coils out. When I do, it feels amazing."
lizardlibrary,jdp7y3,"What should I expect getting my ends trimmed at the beauty shop?&&&If I see a problem or knot in my ends, I'll cut just that little bit with hair scissors and that's basically what I've been doing since forever. I don't do routine trimming of my ends and have only had it done at the salon a handful of times in my life. I want to go to a salon because I would like a professional to do it before I ever try to do it on my own. I'm natural and don't want any heat used on my hair. Would they be able to cut my ends without heat? What is the process? If straightened (which I'm not going to do, I just mean for reference), my hair would be midway down my back so what would a reasonable price range be in a large city on the US east coast?&&&:(

I'm okay with a blow out but 5 inches is so much noo. My hair is 4b and really breakable and fragile. It has volume but is like soft baby hair. I'm so careful with it but get so much breakage that I only see growth in protective styles with extensions."
road2health,jdp7y3,"What is your hair texture like? Unless you go to a salon that specializes in curly cuts, they will straighten your hair before cutting. It's the only way they can make it even. Now in terms of how much... well it depend on how uneven, damaged, or how many split ends you have. Based on what you have said here, they may cut off a lot.

This is coming from someone who hadn't gotten a professional cut in 3 years and just had a salon take off about 4 or 5 inches."
PigmentedLady,jdmgnf,">I feel like you're mixing up ""versatility"" with ""convenience

And she/he is mixing it up with time. 

OP missed me when they stated they have to wash/reset if they want to let it down. 

And honestly that is a personal preference. Once i leave style it, im styling it bc i want it to be my style for the day or days."
flirtandflutter,jdmgnf,"I feel like you're mixing up ""versatility"" with ""convenience."" Natural hair is absolutely more versatile than other hair types - however, it is also significantly less convenient. 

There are some transitions that are just not going to be possible without a wash...IMO the key to this is developing a wash routine that is manageable and doesn't cause you to dread ""wash day"" (really it should be wash hour or wash afternoon). I feel like a lot of people honestly over complicate it by trying to achieve perfection every day. Once you let that ideal go and learn to love/live with imperfection, it becomes much easier."
letssgooooo,jdmgnf,"Unpopular Opinion: Natural hair is not versatile&&&Yes, natural hair is versatile in the TYPES of styles we can achieve – curls, twists, sleek and straight, braids, fros, etc — but the the time it takes to achieve these styles (and the effort it takes to transition from one to the other) significantly limits the versatility.

While I love the overall look (and health) of my hair in comparison to my relaxed days, I’m not going to lie — I really miss the day to day versatility of relaxed hair.

If the look I want is an updo during the day (puff, bun, etc) but for the evening I’d prefer to wear it down and curly — that transition is not really possible without a full, time consuming wash/reset. That’s not even a major style transition — simply going from an updo to wearing my hair down...for most people that entails just taking off an elastic band, lol

And let’s not even talk about further limitations once outside elements are a factor (sweating, swimming, rain, etc).

This is really the most significant natural hair mental drain for me. I want to have fun in simple styling from day to day, but feel very limited. Anyone relate?&&&True, you’re right —  convenience is a better word. I’ve actually gotten wash day to a relatively manageable exercise. It’s the days between wash days that are the issue. Not being able to (literally) switch my style up with ease, or being really restricted based on my activity within the week (I.e. working out) is really frustrating."
KPGrl05,jdgi71,"Couple questions, sis. What is you hair routine (When and how do you moisturize? How often do you wash and with what? How often do you deep condition or condition and with what? What is you nighttime/sleep routine? Any chemical dyes? Etc). 
Also, what is your typical hair style worn most often?
Do you find that you have a high amount of hair breakage/shedding?"
itz___lili,jdgi71,"Length&&&&&&I'd say that I moisturise my hair after I wash and when it feels dry, i was my hair around every 1-2 weeks depending on the style that it's in. If it's in a protective style then i may leave it longer till i wash it.
 I sometimes braid my hair at night but i often just throw a bonnet on.
I rarely deep condition but I condition everytime I wash. I do experience quite a bit of shedding when i do my hair, it is often small amounts.
My hair has never been chemically treated (dyed or relaxed) however, I have had it flat ironed in the past."

peonyroselavender,jdfk9t,I miss my color *sigh*&&&
hyperhoshiko,jdbb32,"For anyone living in NYC, what salons are 4c hair friendly?&&&Hi all. I really have been wanting to get my hair professionally done for a while but kinda have salon phobia lol. I honestly just wanna get a trim and probably even out my hair some but my search has been long and hard. Please drop some salons so I can check them out.&&&Don’t really have a budget"
jrla1992,jdbb32,Please recommend places that deal with Men too!
junebugg15,jdbb32,Black Curl Magic has a directory of stylists you can check out.
road2health,jdbb32,What is your budget like?  That will make all the difference in the suggestions.
tm33ks,jdbb32,Vanity hair studio in Brooklyn have great reviews

SoftRayne,jd5tgm,"Have you tried changing hair products? When I do a braid out or twist out I find my hair looks better when I use thin water based products but when I do a wash n go thicker creamy products work better. Try to find products that your hair like which can be a pain. Also try to avoid using different products from different lines that don’t mix well. You can also try doing the shingling method or use gels for a little more hold. Good luck hope this helps, having natural hair can been be bitter sweet sometimes."
yaboynick1234,jd5tgm,non visible curls&&&does anybody have the solution to when you have thick hair and your hair curls up but you can’t really see it because of how frizzy your hair is
Adoreu2,jd4ca4,Can I use Blue Magic Coconut Oil Grease as a Heat Protectant?&&&Planning to just blowdry my hair for a stretched braidout. I don't have any actual heat protectant so I was wondering if Blue Magic would work. I'll be using the low heat setting and only running over my hair strands a maximum of three times. (I also haven't used heat on my hair for nearly a year and a half).
Apuddinfilledbunny,jd4ca4,"I use that as a heat protectant never got damage, but I only go to 180 degrees."
formyfrog,jd4ca4,"I'm fairly certain the blue magic will melt and you'll have a hot oil situation. 

Source: my burned neck from my childhood after using blue magic with a hot comb."
withsprinkleszz,jd4ca4,Please god do not do this. Use a heat protectant or blow dry spray

IdkWhyImHereBruh,jcodjn,I love to use the Camille Rose Curl Maker gel for my twists and I have thin 4b/mostly 4c hair. There’s some shrinkage but it’s not too extreme. I also make sure to twist the ends so it can last longer.
