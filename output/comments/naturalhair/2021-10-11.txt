Disney_Villian,qaeh9m,"None of the things suggested here will help if you don’t get regular trims.  That is one of the most important parts of maintaining healthy ends.  You will continue to have the ends come off no matter what until you trim it off right above where the damage is and continue to maintain your trims every 8-10 weeks.  Everybody is hiring now.  Get a job save your money and pay to get your hair done.  It’s your life and as a beautiful young lady you will have to get used to setting boundaries with your family.  Your mom can be mad all she wants, she can’t do anything after you get it cut."
IamOnessy,qaeh9m,"You need a lot hidratation, and protein"
KEnyinna,qaeh9m,You definitely need a good trim and you'll be fine.
Monasgma,qaeh9m,Are you losing weight?  How much water do you drink? Your hair is breaking off. Do you deep Condition ? I don’t think so. Your hair is dry and is craving moisture. Do you sleep with a bonnet?
SnooChipmunks3049,qaeh9m,"Judging by the pics & your other responses, you would benefit from hydration and protective styling. Go back to your roots, try grease- blue magic, Palmers, etc. All thick & provide long term moisture in comparison to plain moisturizers on their own or locked in with a light oil. Apply a cream moisturizer on damp hair, top it off with grease to seal. You’ll stay hydrated longer & help with breakage. 

Protective styles that guard your ends until you can trim them will be helpful. Cornrows, braided buns, etc. If you’re into wigs or sew ins, you could slap those in to avoid constant manipulation. 

If you do use heat, get a really good heat resistant product. I’d recommend mizzani products. They’re moisturizing, light, and heat resistant. Spray in the leave in, blow dry your hair (IN SECTIONS), then straight to a protective style that tucks your ends away. 

Let me just say, split ends with continue to split all the way up the hair shaft. That’s why so many people are suggesting a trim if you want to improve your hair health or see any noticeable changes/growth. I would personally suggest doing it anyway.

Does your mom hide the scissors? Watch a YouTube video and snip your ends. You don’t need to do a big chop, she will obviously notice that. But a little trim of 1/2 inch she will not notice. 

Also, if you do tight ponytails, the scrunchies you use play a huge role in causing breakage so try to be gentler on your hair. 

Ultimate goal here is to;

avoid matting- combing through matted, dry hair will cause it to break off 

STAY Moisturized- so your hair will be easy to detangle, hydrated (=growth), less prone to breakage 

Protective style- keep your ends away from further damage since you can’t trim any off."
chronosxci,qaeh9m,"OK, unsure of diet/genetics/other bodily things that may influence hair loss. Outside of that:

I'm not sure whether or not to use a protein treatment for your hair. If it feels really hard, don't yet.

I also don't know your porosity or texture, but my hair was absolutely doing this when it wasn't getting enough moisture. Make sure your products aren't full of something like silicone because it leaves your hair unable to absorb moisture if you're not using a clarifying shampoo. If you can't afford more products, that's fine! Baking soda/apple cider vinegar cleanse might work for a clarifying shampoo if you suspect product buildup. (For more details, put this into Google-naturally curly has a good recipe!) Right now I use creme of nature apple cider vinegar clarifying rinse. You won't need to do this every week, maybe once a month? For the other weeks I use as I am cowash (conditioner washing in general is a good strategy.)

Those $1-$2 packets of creme of nature deep conditioner helped save my hair. If you can't easily comb thru it, I'd shampoo just the roots, rinse them well, and put a LOT of deep conditioner on your hair. Like, ""is my hair drowning"" levels of it. Maybe 4 packs? And put a conditioning cap, or those one use shower caps, or some Saran wrap around your hair. You really want it to sit on your hair and warm up. Wait maybe 30 minutes and while the stuff is still on your head try and seperate into 4 large sections, take the others out of the way, and slowly comb or denman brush from the ends up. 
(This is also assuming youve got good styling tools for your hair. Denman brushes / rubber brushes are typically good. I use a kosmologie paddle comb made for type 4 hair when I need to really detangle.)  Put detangled hair into loose twist (this isn't for trimming, just for management).


L'Oreal makes a product called 'Elvive' lamellar rinse. It's under $10- you don't have to use it but it cuts down on frizz. I use this after detangling, and then rinse out per directions. 

If you have a good hair milk or leave in conditioner, really work it into your hair. (I use the as I am line-cocoshea whip and moisture milk rn). Be generous. 


You can air dry or blow dry, if you're trimming it definitely blow dry in small sections.

Getting a professional trim helps a ton. If you can't do that right now, that's ok! Section your hair into medium-large twists and trim the really thin end pieces until it's more uniform.

This is how I get by with my 4 (a/b/c/lmnop) hair so far. 🤣 

Not a professional or a hair stylist, but I've had to wrangle natural hair alone for a while! I hope this helps.

Edit: you said that you hair is heat damaged. I'd talk to a professional about how to grow out the damage."
exuberantsociety,qaeh9m,"Can Anyone Help Me?&&&&&&My mom wont let me trim or big chop&&&ty for this. this response was better than the same 'get a trim' ones. like ik its important but i need more info&&&she does her own perms. i do but they dont work on my hair. either made it feels like rubber or dried my hair and caused build up&&&Like I said in the comments, can't trim or get a professional&&&I sleep with a bonnet yes, I am currently trying to gain weight but my weight is being complicated.

Haven't been to a salon ever, it's expensive in my state. Like I said in the comments, I can't trim. I can take a picture of my products if you'd like. I think the treseme made my hair this way&&&Can't get a job, parent's rules. 'It's your life' doesn't count in my house ;-;&&&I need to know my porosity and hair type. Totally forgot to say it in the title I'm sorry. My hair takes a short time to get wet, but a long time to dry. My hair is heat damaged and it has been shedding alot these past few weeks since I took out my protective style. I can barely see my strands and when my hair breaks off, sometimes it has a white tip on the strand, sometimes it's just the strand. It always breaks off it I comb it or run my fingers through my hair. It has gotten so bad and short (armpit to collarbone) the only styles I can do is space buns and high puff&&&fyi: recently stopped washing my hair and moisturizing it as of last week because of the fact no matter what i do to my hair, more hair falls off"
thebigbraintheory19,qaeh9m,You probably want to trim your ends a bit.
whosthtgrl,qaeh9m,"You need to cleanse your hair every 7-10 days. Scalp health is important so you have to clean your hair and scalp regularly. Trims are also essential to growing healthy hair. Your hair will continue to split up the shaft and break. Porosity and such do not matter if you’re not properly cleansing your hair and scalp and getting trims. 

If your mom gets relaxers, she’s in the salon regularly so I’m not understanding her logic with your hair. However, that’s neither here nor there. If she won’t let you visit a salon every once in a while, you have to find ways to care for your hair. Do you have anything at home?"

StarChildArt,qab08f,"Crochet braiding pattern for medium hair?&&&Hey all,
I recently started doing crochet braids. I looked up some braiding tutorials on YouTube, but my braids come out too thick. Then it hit me, my hair is way longer than a lot of people who do these. I've done the connected box method, but the connections end up being too big. I've also had someone cornrow the back of my head both horizontally and vertically, but the braids end up too thick at some point. 
My hair is a little past my bra strap straightened. It's also 3c/4a and thick af. Does anyone know how I can stuff it all under some crochet braids without my hair being visible? I'm trying protective styles because I work outside these days and winter is coming 🙃"
Daddysmainbitch,q9shkq,"Search up “360 mirror” on google, that’s the ones I use

I use the brand: self cut system"
No_Name_584,q9shkq,"Mirror to Help Part My Hair?&&&Hey y’all,

So I suck at parting my hair, used to have a 3 part cabinet/mirror but I don’t anymore. It’s difficult for me to part my hair unless I can see most of the back of my head. Any mirrors y’all could recommend? I checked Amazon but I wanted to ask here too :)&&&Thank you so much!"
AsleepYellow3,q9pts0,I use all 3 in my 4c lazy natural regimen. And I have low porosity hair. The shampoo is very moisturizing and doesn’t leave my hair matted and tangled like other shampoos do. And the the deep conditioner with heat is amazing. My curls be popping after I rinse. Overall I use majority of Crème of Nature products. They attempt great and affordable.
Just_ate_ur_,q9pts0,Love the shampoo on my 4c hair as it softens it instantly. Never tried the conditioner though . I should probably do.
Minimum_Ostrich751,q9pts0,Anyone use these products ? Are they bad for natural hair I just recently started using these. They haven’t dried my hair out or anything but the curling creams doesn’t really do any justice lol&&&
Novel_Junket_9909,q9pts0,What are some of your favorite alternates?
Peanut0131,q9pts0,I use the spray leave in. It works pretty well for me and keeps my hair soft. I have 3c/4a mixed porosity.
Taywhite2112,q9pts0,"I used to use the leave in, never had issues"
VelvetQueen1212,q9pts0,I love this line! It works well with most textures I'd say because i used it when my hair was relaxed and now as a natural girl it's lovely just the same.
bookworm924,q9pts0,I love creme of nature products. That’s the shampoo and conditioner I use and my hair loves it.
bottledbed,q9pts0,"Love the shampoo! The leave in is okay, it does the job but there are better options"
celestial1305,q9pts0,I use the intensive conditioner and the ACV clarifying wash. I have 3c hair with bad bleach damage at the tips. The conditioner is good and feels hydrating.
hanap8127,q9pts0,I used to love that shampoo but haven’t tried anything else.
madisonsj,q9pts0,the intensive leave in treatment is great. I also really like the curl activator creme from the this line
singingkiltmygrandma,q9pts0,I don’t trust the brand overall for hair care. It’s owned by Revlon. I prefer black owned brands or at least black created.

IMOY21,q9ioeq,"A little rant&&&Today I took out my two strand twists. Not because i didn’t like them but my parents didn’t so they basically called everyone we know to try and get my twists out. After three days of nonstop battle with literally everyone in this house they’re out. With them went my confidence. I hate the way I look now but nobody cares about that all they care about is how they think I look. I’ve been told I’m hurting the family, selfish and spoiled all for wanting to keep my hair in. All my motivation to do schoolwork is gone now which is ironic because they would interrupt me doing school work to tell me my hair was a distraction. I’m really tired I feel ugly and like i’m in someone else’s body. I didn’t tell them i was getting twists but that didn’t warrant all the crazy things they said to me bare in mind I didn’t say anything outlandish and actually kept my composure. I don’t harbour any resentment to them but I am tired. When i grow up I want too get out of this house and never comeback.&&&Thank you. Your probably right but I can’t really deal with that right now. All I can do is get away later dew more months to go.&&&Luv bro❤️&&&17, hairdresser they think it’s a bad look for men to have long plaited hair and a year ago they had an issue with it last month i came in with starter dreads they didn’t have an issue with it the only difference is that these are two strand twists with extensions. 
I’m tired from arguing abt my hair with my family cba for school work today. They aren’t related i just found it ironic. don’t get me wrong your right abt school work i’m drained tho"
aquariously,q9ioeq,"Sorry to hear you are going through this, your feelings are all valid too. Remember that your mental health is important and you don’t need to confront them if you are not mentally able to. Stay strong!"
happyhippoking,q9ioeq,"I am so sorry your going through this. The reaction from your family is unnecessary and over-exaggerated. They sound irrational and controlling. That's a really unfair, unhealthy and toxic environment. Confidence and bodily autonomy is so important to self-image and self-worth.

I know your hair is important to you. It also sounds like there's some confidence issues in general aside from the hair. Your hair isn't all of you, it's just one part of you that makes you beautiful and special."
stealthpursesnatch,q9ioeq,"How old are you? Who put the twists in? What specifically was their problem with the twists or the style? Did you do this knowing you were not allowed to do this? 

Regardless - your schoolwork and hair are unrelated. Don’t use this as an excuse to not do what you’re supposed to do."
Missgenius44,q9g4o8,I don’t switch based on weather. 22 century woman has given my hair life. When I go for the trim stylists are always in awe of my hair 😂
Urfavorganiccheeto,q9g4o8,"It's not exactly humectants that are the issue, it's the type that matters. You want conditioners with 'film-forming humectants' since they are not based on weather conditions.

keyszn,q9fya7,You have very nice smile. I agree!
Abakes492,q9e4z5,What's your natural curl pattern?
BlankeSpace,q9e4z5,Needs to be tucked tighter. Each twist should wrapped and twisted around each other. It should prevent this.
ChocolateNapqueen,q9e4z5,"This Happened to me too. I have to use the best hold gel to deal with this and it has to be applied while twisting. One thing that ruins it is the type of hair. If you get 3c hair and your hair is 4c, this will happen a lot quicker. I like this style but I will only do it if I’m going somewhere for the weekend. I find myself having to retwist after that weekend. 

I’ll use a more course hair to do twists due to this."
Slight-Dingo-6829,q9e4z5,This happened to me. By the end of week 1 they started to slip out 😩 NEVER AGAIN
StonedKitten-420,q9e4z5,"One of of the reasons I use kinkier hair, Brazilian wool or acrylic yarn. 👍🏾 Straight, fine synthetic hair is nightmare fuel to me."
Urikalynn_,q9e4z5,"This happened to me with my box braids last year. Literally hours. I just assumed the girl didnt have experience with natural hair. 

Buy edge gel and moose. It made my hair presentable i also washed my braids shortly after and my hair curled around it which made it look a little better imo

Edit: also decorations! I bought some colorful hemp string and put it on the braids that were really bad."
amavenectar,q9e4z5,"Even with kanekalon, they shouldn’t look like this after three days. I think your braider just may not do senegalese twists very well. This hair type is what’s normally used for the style."
aquariously,q9e4z5,"That is crazy!! I don’t really believe it is because of your natural hair, I find natural hair the best hair to braid as it is really easy to get braids to latch onto, did she even dip the ends in hot water? Because that always does the trick for me! It sucks though when that happens"
girl-w-glasses,q9e4z5,Should not be happening especially not on day 3. It looks like your stylist did not twist your natural hair tightly with the extension. I would suggest going back to them.
keystoviolence,q9e4z5,No😭😭😭
lilolilac,q9e4z5,It's not but she probably struggled twisting in your ends. Ive had this happen before but after a few weeks with passion twists.
linda_linda_,q9e4z5,I would also add next time make sure they use edge gel even on the ends of your hair... not regular gel alone. Edge gel will give your ends a nice hold.
petite_jpg,q9e4z5,Nope never happened to me. From the looseness of those twists it’s clear somebody didn’t go to an auntie *with experience* to install those. Those lackadaisical loose twists only work with more textured braiding hair.
stargazer9504,q9e4z5,Senegalese twists do not last very long on natural hair if you use fine straight hair. I recommend trying the twists with Marley hair next time.
vfe0698,q9e4z5,Just Got Twists is This Normal?&&&&&&Lesson has definitely been learned. I think I used Marley hair the last couple times. Should’ve just stuck to what I know.&&&Hey all! I just got a twist installation three days ago and I got them smaller than usual. I also switched the type of hair I used this time. I am noticing frizzing and my natural hair seems to be slipping out the twist. How do I maintain these? I never never had this issue with bigger twist installations. I wrap my hair at night and then secure it with a bonnet. I do not do much to the actual twists but I regularly oil my scalp. Any guidance would be appreciated!&&&Unfortunately I came home to go to my stylist. She is about an hour out from me now. I could always try to find someone in my area for a retwist but she honestly did not charge me much so I am thinking about just rocking it out for a week at most. Is there any downside to this other than it looking a bit messy and is there anyway for me to slightly touch it up?&&&Definitely a mix between 4a and 4b
winner_luzon,q9e4z5,">I have to use the best hold gel to deal with this and it has to be applied while twisting. 

This is it but the trade off is you can't leave them in for long for fear of damaging/drying your hair.

Double down and use a hot wet towel and hair straightener to set it."
LCG05,q9buxs,I have done this before with no problem. In some cases it has put the stylist on to some products they didn't know about.  Just depends how open the stylist is to it.
ThrowawaytheDaisy,q9buxs,That's perfectly fine.
curvyswag,q9buxs,"Asking won’t hurt, but be prepared for the stylist to decline to use your products. If they are using professional products for specific reasons then they may not be interested in using what you’ve brought unless it’s for a medical reason (prescription shampoo for scalp issues etc)."
