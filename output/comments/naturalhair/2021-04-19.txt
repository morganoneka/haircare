2percentbatterygang,myn1wz,I took MSM when I broke my knee a few years ago to help with bone healing and I noticed my hair was noticeably longer within a month. I didnt keep track of the length exactly but if I had to guess I'd say my hair grew about an inch in a month where my hair normally probably grows maybe half an inch a month. Like I said it was noticeable growth. But it made me so so gassy so I never bought it again lol
sweetseamstress,myn1wz,"Has anyone used MSM? If so, how was your results?&&&Hey everyone! I‚Äôve just starting using MSM water this week and obviously haven‚Äôt noticed anything yet but I was just wondering if anyone on here has experience with it before. I don‚Äôt really want to take it internally since I don‚Äôt know what the side effects are so I‚Äôve just been using it externally and I plan to do so. If you have seen results from it positive or negative feel free to let me know, any insight is welcome üòä"

-Jo_Jo-4,mymgon,"Help! My natural hair has ZERO bounce back and stretches out when I detangle&&&Hello naturals ‚ô•Ô∏é 
I have a dilemma that is a bit confusing for me. I've been noticing as I'm growing out my TWA, that my hair stretches *out* when I brush it. Like it has ZERO bounce back, and my hair only has very defined curls on my ends. But, when I step into the shower for the initial soak to wash my hair, my curls are poppin from the rootie to the tootie! Then when I get to sectioning and begin detangling, it all goes down hill from there and my roots and midsection is practically straight. Which is EXTREMELY alarming because I have 3C-4A range hair texture. I use brushes that usually define other naturals' curls like the Denman brush and the Tangle Teezer! When I do my boyfriend's hair with his TT, his curls maintain their pattern and have major bounce back. But then when I put my deep conditioner in, I notice my curls are once again coiling from root to tip. I'm very conflicted as to what to think of it. Do I need more moisture? Do I need to introduce more protein?¬† Should I just ditch the brushes all together, and just finger detangle? I feel if I do that, it won't get a very thorough detangle and I'll get single strand knots (which I loathe)."
DotHOHM,mymgon,Agreed. Sounds like moisture overload.
miaemo,mymgon,"It sounds like you need more protein. Try clarifying your hair and then use a protein treatment. Also, if you have finer strands make sure to use lighter products that won't weigh your hair down too much."

DotHOHM,mygnqg,"If anything other than satin touches my hair, it will fall out. 

Satin headbandsl are a must for breaking edges imo. 

Try putting your bun in different positions. I know it's a pain, but putting it up in the same exact bun itself can cause breakage. 

I like the general plan you have otherwise."
ontariodwarf,mygnqg,"I can‚Äôt speak to the part about trying to protect your edges specifically, but I also have mostly type 4 hair recovering from damage and I work out 5-6x per week. When I work out, I wear my hair in a bun with a headband that‚Äôs not tight- basically just to keep my hair out of my face and just tight enough to not fall off my head. I wash my scalp with shampoo whenever it feels dirty, even if that‚Äôs after only 4 or so days or if it happens to be longer than I normally push it, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs too much manipulation for you trying to be extra gentle with your edges. I always use a rinse out conditioner to detangle in the shower after shampooing and almost always follow with a deep conditioner and then add my leave ins and style, so I think of wash day as not just a time to clean my scalp and hair but also add in enough moisture to get me to the next wash day. I normally wear my hair in flat twists for a day and then as a twist out (usually in a bun) til wash day and I don‚Äôt do anything to it between wash days except put on a satin bonnet to sleep, so I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a trade off: wash more often but only moisturize and manipulate on wash day, or wash less frequently but have to re-moisturize more often. Again, it also depends on how much you‚Äôre willing to manipulate your hair for the sake of your edges, but here‚Äôs my input just from personal experience!"
trixy136,mygnqg,"Working out with natural hair and maintaining edge re-growth&&&I have type 4c natural hair and I‚Äôve been having some breakage at my edges. I suspect it a from years of protective style after protective style (box braids or crochet braids with cornrows) that‚Äôs lead to most of this breakage. I‚Äôm on a mission to grow my edges back fuller and longer. Right now I‚Äôve decided to leave my hair out for the next 4 weeks to give it extra TLC. 

I work out 5 times a week, and do admit that in the past the only time I‚Äôd do a full wash with shampoo and conditioner was when I took my braids down. In between, I would try and refresh my scalp with diluted ACV. I would oil daily with black castor oil and spray down my scalp and braids with a diluted mix of water and leave in conditioner (carols daughter hair milk).

After doing some research, I plan on taking on this weekly care routine while my hair is out to help combat breakage from sweating so much:

1. After every workout, spray scalp with mixture of water, witch hazel, drops of tea tree oil, and black castor oil. 
2. Shampoo, condition, and deep condition hair weekly.
3. Apply leave in conditioner (Tgin miracle repair) after weekly hair wash. For every following day just spry hair down with mix of the leave in and water instead of concentrated leave in conditioner to prevent heavy buildup.
4. Oil scalp and edges daily with black castor oil mixed with drops of peppermint and tea tree essential oils 

While I wear my natural hair in a ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù bun at the top of my head during workouts and it general, I leave the hair around it edges out and pin then to the side. 

I sweat a lot at the gym, so I do wear a headband. It‚Äôs cotton and I‚Äôve been wearing it just on my forehead, not touching my edges. However, I‚Äôm planning on first wrapping my edges with a satin scarf and then putting on the headband. Is this overkill?

If you‚Äôre natural and work out a lot, let me know how I can improve on this plan and any tips you have! Thanks!&&&I really need to learn how to flat twist. I usually do mini braids with just my natural hair to stretch it or protect it while I‚Äôm keeping my hair out. I‚Äôm definitely going to do weekly washes as I think a lot of the damage I‚Äôve been getting was also from product and sweat build up. ACV rinses just don‚Äôt do the job when you really need a deep clean.&&&I do have one more question, when I finish spritzing near my roots with the witch hazel mixture after a workout, do I need to re-moisturize my hair with leave in conditioner? Or is the water included in the witch hazel mixture enough moisture?"

Intelligent_Estate38,mybutp,"I use ‚Äúknot on my watch‚Äù Aunt Jackie‚Äôs detangler, then I finger detangle and then use a with a wide tooth comb"
MissD34,mybutp,I swear by [this](https://www.princessdgifts.com/products/aloe-rose-detangling-spray)! It literally melts your tangles away and provides lots of moisture. Always start from the end of your hair to the roots with a wide tooth comb or your fingers.
Wanderlust1101,mybutp,"I am not a fan of Knot Today. Kinky Curling Custard is my forever bae though.  Karen's Body Beautiful leave ins   Sweet Ambrosia, Hair Nectar,and Super Silky are all phenomenal. Use a wide toothed shower comb, part in sections and break those sections into subsections. Lots of slip and very concentrated too."
forevermilky,mybutp,"What's the BEST detangling product for 4C hair?&&&I often wear my hair in two strand twists, and I left it in that style for too long so now 3 of my twists are kinda stuck together.

freespiritedflower,mybutp,Nope nope nope. Trust me on this. Mousse. You know the setting lotion you use to do an old school roller set? You know the slip it gives your hair? That‚Äôs all you need. Roller set mousse. $5. And this is coming from a women with 4c hair.&&&I‚Äôm gonna post a video and try and tag you
lovervvs,mybutp,KNOT TODAY!!!!! life saver&&&and a large comb. comb from the ends first
ontariodwarf,mybutp,"I‚Äôve used both knot today and knot on my watch and like both. My favorite rinse-out conditioner for detangling is Aussie 3 minute miracle. At the end of the day, anything that‚Äôs slippery (or has slip) regardless of what‚Äôs really in it (although, certain ingredients lend to really slippery products) works best for my hair. Highly recommend applying to wet hair and letting it sit for a few mins before detangling, and if your tangles are really bad it might help to put on a shower cap (maybe with heat). I watch a YouTuber afope atoyebi who has an excellent video on detangling severely knotted hair using silicones. I can‚Äôt link here but search her and you should find it! As far as tools go, I start with my fingers and work my way up to a detangling brush - if your hair is really tangled you could try fingers, wide tooth comb then brush"
Appropriate_Heron_82,my324f,"My hair texture is very similar to yours -
The best thing that worked for me was washing , moisturizing while wet , stretching my hair for a day, then twisting with no product.  I would put a little bit of CD hair milk on the ends when done and mist with braid spray. 
Twisting my fingers while twisting never worked because my hair is fine and it made the twists limp. 
Twisting May not work for your hair too and that‚Äôs okay too.  It doesn‚Äôt work for mine."
Bahar_sisi,my324f,Comb your hair in the bath ü§ó
Cnstclr,my324f,Yes! I was about to say twisting souffle. You also need to moisturize your hair before doing any protective styles. Also.. I seen someone above saying to use the two strand method. I think that would work well for you.
Creativ3Ren,my324f,"I think you would probably benefit from doing larger twists or even trying flat twists (def recommend the latter). When you are doing the single strand twists you can try rolling the ends with small perms rods. But DON‚ÄôT twist the hair all the way down. Leave the ends that you‚Äôll roll up into the perm rods loose, and just wrap it around. Hope this helps! :)"
Dangerous-Amoeba3493,my324f,"Hi guys, if you are interested in learning Arabic I can help you, I am interested in English"
Embarrassed_Cow,my324f,"My twists are never really defined and end up unraveling. Any tips?&&&&&&I do basically the same thing. Either Ill do it on freshly washed hair or Ill go in a spray a bunch of water before I start. Then of course leave in, a cream and then oil. I may need to add in a jell too. The twisting motion works for some of my hair but theres a lot of it that just doesn't care so ill see if rollers work on them.&&&Yea I see so many videos of twists on 4C hair and wasnt sure what I should do different. I started braiding the top but doing the bottom is a good idea! Thanks&&&haha Ill watch a video cause I have no idea how you twist for Senegalese twists. thanks for the tip!&&&Lol Ill look it up. Thanks!&&&I use both! But im not really worried about my edges. Theyve been gone since I was a toddler and I dont have any memory of having them. Tons of memories of my entire family trying every oil, pill, cream and prayer to get them to grow though. lol Thank you!"
GrimStylez,my324f,When you twist your hair try twisting your fingers you are holding the hair with and the hair strand with you hands. It‚Äôs harder to explain but you‚Äôll need to watch a video on it. Because on paper it looks very confusing.
ILive4Banans,my324f,Are you normally twisting them or are you twisting them with the method you would use for Senegalese twists? They're more likely to stay in with the second method as the strands are twisted in on themselves - it's hard to explain without watching a tutorial lol
MinimalistEve,my324f,This is how I have to do mines and I have a combination of a heavy oil and a spray keeps them from unraveling. My favorite is if I‚Äôm weaving or throwing yarn in my hair I do the braiding at the top for the first few then twist away. If it‚Äôs just my natural hair no yarn or weave the I twist in the opposite direction farther down.
OptimalArmadillo81,my324f,"Use a good gel that would make them stay as they are, even natural aloe Vera gel works really well"
RahBreddits,my324f,What type of hair do you have?
Urikalynn_,my324f,"Maybe bigger twist? Whenever my twist unravel it‚Äôs usually because I do them too small. 

There‚Äôs a section of my hair that has a very loose curl so I have to do the top pretty chunky so it stays"
blkgurl_Majik,my324f,You can use some virgin hair growth oil and black Jamaican castor oil for your edges boo
freespiritedflower,my324f,I say rock them the way they naturally fall for you
hidden-question,my324f,I've found that trying to make the braid mimick the size of my natural curl helps the twist stay together. anything too much bigger or smaller makes it unravel quick!
mandukie,my324f,"okay, this will sound dumb but it works for me. say you have 2 chunks of hair, a and b, instead of twisting right away,  divide them into a1/a2 and b1/b2 and twist them, then twist a and b to form a mega twist ü§£"
onefourthtexan,my324f,"You have a looser curl pattern. You might have to just braid the end a couple times or add a twist tie. Some of my hair has a looser curl pattern too and that section will unravel and take way longer to dred.&&&This may not be the best idea for black hair, I‚Äôm thinking this because overtwisting can cause breakage of fragile strands."
silky_link07,my324f,"How are you twisting them? Are you using products?

My best twists are done on damp hair. If I just washed my hair, I use a leave in conditioner, sometimes an oil, and always a twisting cream (my hair likes Mielle‚Äôs twisting souffl√© from the pomegranate and honey line and the Taliah Waajid curly curl cream to name a couple and not at the same time lol). If I haven‚Äôt just washed it, I break out the spray bottle and mist my hair so it‚Äôs damp and use just the twisting cream. 

As for the ends, I do the little twist motion to lock them in place. If that doesn‚Äôt work for you alone, you can use a small hair roller on your ends until they dry."
solarpanel_d,my324f,You could try braiding the beginning a little and then twisting the rest of the way down. Or you could do the method where you twist both strands of hair that you‚Äôre going to use opposite ways and then twist them together. You could also use little rubber bands to tie up the section of hair before twisting it (make sure to put oil on the rubber bands if you do). Also make sure to twist the end with a lil extra product. Make sure you use some type of product with some hold whether that be gel or custard whatever your hair needs. Also your twist won‚Äôt come out good if your hair is dry so make sure your hair is healthy.
the_heaviest_feather,my324f,"Some of the best advice I‚Äôve received is that don‚Äôt twist down, just keep twisting and eventually you‚Äôll twist down. I think this was on Naptural85‚Äôs Youtube channel... the idea is that when you twist, don‚Äôt twist and move down the hair, like you would a braid, instead just keep twisting and eventually you come to the end of the hair and it‚Äôs a much tighter twist. It‚Äôs hard to explain but if I can find the video I‚Äôll post it!"

GeauxBeyond,mx92or,I haven‚Äôt used oils in over a month. I used to do LCO with jojoba oil or with Camille Rose Cocoa Nibs and Honey. My hair is doing great and I won‚Äôt be going back to oils.
GenneyaK,mx92or,Best hair oils?&&&I am curious on what oils do you swear by or is anyone trying out the new hair trend of not using oils (if you are let me know how that‚Äôs working out for you too)
Missgenius44,mx92or,"So I actually stopped using oils years  before the trend but didn‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs what made my hair thrive. I got sick hair started shedding. Got a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and that‚Äôs all I used. And a gel. I kept on telling people how much length I have retained and now I hardly have hair falling out. And I don‚Äôt use any Leavins. I didn‚Äôt realize this was a movement I kind of just figured it out and my hair has been thriving. But the trick is is that you need a very moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. 

What you have to realize is that a lot of these businesses are in there to make money right so they‚Äôre going to make a lot of products that‚Äôs really not necessary for you to use so just keep that in mind. Let me know if you want me to recommend the product to you I use this woman‚Äôs product and I swear by it."
