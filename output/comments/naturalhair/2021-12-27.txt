Blaque-Cat,rusune,"You need to wash and style your hair again, that’s what that means."
Misisme20,rusune,I have noticed that water isn't the only way to hydrate my curls. You might need to apply a product (a leave in) to your hair to get your curls back.
Winknudgeshrug,rusune,Did you use a wide tooth comb with the conditioner in? This happens to me sometimes and it takes the comb to get the curls back to their proper clumping pattern/group
geemav,rusune,"I picked out my hair and now I can’t get my curls back 😭&&&I usually have defined spiral curls in my daily wear - I just wet, gel, and go. Well yesterday I picked out my hair just to see how long it was and now I literally can’t get my curls back. I’ve stayed under water and applied conditioner and my hair is just in this puffed out curl-less state. How do I get my curls back?"
Goddess_Iris_,ruqnby,"Right! I posted hair growth journey pics a while back and all I was met with was toxicity. I'm not even sure why I'm still in this sub, lol thanks for the reminder to leave!"
LuminousMizar,ruqnby,Why is the natural hair community so toxic?&&&[removed]&&&yw
fivetenash,ruqnby,"Hey there OP, as a new member of our subreddit, I'm sorry to hear you haven't had the chance to read our Housekeeping post or some of the other meta posts in our subreddit where we explicitly discuss posts that will be removed. Namely posts about hair type, and posts of people posting wads of their hair asking ""is this a lot of hair??"". We encourage users to SEARCH the subreddit as almost all of their questions will be answered. We don't want a multitude of the same types of posts that can be quickly answered. Feel free to send a modmail if you have any questions *after* reading the meta posts and our subreddit rules which are both clearly posted. Thanks."
hillyjones,ruqnby,It’s definitely bizarre. It’s crazy because the “community” complains about natural hair discrimination (which I’m not invalidating it’s a thing) but at the same time demonize and shut out so many naturals in this sub at the same time if they’re not experts and their hair isn’t their definition of perfect.
popcornnhero,ruqnby,"I went back to see your original post and I don't know why it was deleted. 

I think when it comes to certain niche communities, there's this ""*do as I do or you are wrong*"" mentality that I see manifest; any opinion or thought that deviates from the group thinking is quickly shot down."
BrooklynVS,rupqte,"Olaplex is great but it looks like you could do a good cut just to even it out. Since the ends are of your hair are different lengths you’re probably snagging your hair into each other causing the strands to shed excessively or get single strand knots. 
I know it’s not the ideal answer but a new year and a 2 inch cut from a professional and a really awesome deep conditioner might be the answer!"
EyeGap,rupqte,Hot oil treatments
Infinite-Swordfish97,rupqte,Is it heat damage? Olaplaex can’t hurt and maybe a gradual trim.
MrsFreshB00TY,rupqte,My hair looks so similar to yours!! I’m convinced I just need a good cut
Pretty_princess1996,rupqte,Your hair could possibly be looking like that because of something internal like a mineral/vitamin deficiency
Yalla56,rupqte,"Idk what to do, it’s not dry nor falling out. Would olaplaex help or just cut it all off?&&&"
awwai,rupqte,"Yes, it is a possibility! My hair looked like OP's when I had iron deficiency. I thought it couldn't be anemia because my hair wasn't falling out. Got a professional haircut and started to take iron supplements, one year later my hair (and my body as well) looks completely different and healthy."
Blaque-Cat,rup4nh,"Routines should be consistent and gives consistent results. You deep condition more often than you shampoo, so there’s your first issue. Healthy hair starts with a clean scalp, and that can only be achieved by shampooing regularly. At least once a week is best for most people. You’re also using heavy styling products that have film forming ingredients, especially that EcoStyler. These Shea Moisture products and that gel create buildup, and the shampoo you’re using isn’t very cleansing, so it can’t remove all of the old product. That leads to frizzy hair or styles not lasting, which makes you think your routine isn’t working. I suggest you look into better quality products. Kinky Curly Come Clean is a great drugstore clarifying shampoo. Clarifying shampoo should only be used occasionally to remove heavy buildup and must be followed by moisturizing shampoo."
YoYo_ismael,rup4nh,"Is it normal for the routine to sometimes be a holy grail and other days absolutely shit ? And do you have any recommendations for my routine?&&&Hair type : low porosity, dry, coarse and curly hair always 

Routine : Shampoo twice a month with Shea Moisture Curl and shine shampoo, same type of conditioner as the shampoo

Shampoo twice a month with bounce curl clarifying shampoo (different days from the other normal shampoo)

deep condition once a week with Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil Masque 

Now for the styling products that I use after the shampooing/ when I want about to go out and want my hair to look decent 

 Rub in Shea Moisture Strengthen & Restore Leave-In Conditioner, Rub in shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie and finally Rub in Eco styling gel olive oil 

This routine sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t…ether way I think it can improve&&&I think you misunderstood me…

I shampoo 4 times a month which is actually once a week except two of these 4 times are with clarifying shampoo and the other two are with a normal one"
Blaque-Cat,ruoxga,"Shampoo and condition your hair, apply gel to soaking wet hair. Separate in smaller sections, then rake and smooth to define. Sit under a hooded dryer or use a diffuser to dry."
Salt-Response8486,ruoxga,i have small s shape curl pattern and it’s tight but some are not defined. how do i define them?&&&[removed]

Cierradical,runxf8,"Confused about 4c hair care&&&Ive seen so many different opinions about 4c hair care. Ive seen someone say you shouldn’t use anything but water and gel, and another say you need to use hair grease. Ive seen people say not to use heat, but some people say use heat because air drying damages the cuticle of your hair. Im just so confused and wondering what some of you have used to get your hair to grow."
etherealmeadows,runxf8,Jenniferrosenyc on twitter has great hair care tips! Also blackgirlcurls is a good resource
Lacasadelmango,runaz8,"African Pride aloe pre poo is really good. I always use it when taking down box braids and it makes the process a lot easier. I leave it in for about an hour. By the time I shampoo, my hair feels really moisturized and detangling is easy."
MelSaf02,runaz8,"Prepooing natural hair&&&I just took out my hair from a crochet protective style and it’s already dry. I’m planning on prepooing my hair, but I don’t know if I should even do it since my hair is dry. Should I do it or not?"
Pretty_princess1996,runaz8,If you want ease with your detangling process you should do it.
etherealmeadows,runaz8,You don’t need to prepoo your hair that’s unnecessary just shampoo & conditioner every 7-10 days
sammyfire2001,runaz8,Prepoo is always a good idea in my opinion. Makes detangling a breeze
GoodPie69,run4s4,Natural&&&
Low-Art7661,rulo1v,Alisa muito o cabelo progressiva caseira&&&
MissD34,ruaujr,"Is it working for you? If so, then no…keep doing what works."
Neisha_with_a_T,ruaujr,You shouldn't have to moisturize you hair that heavily everyday. I moisturize once a week at most twice . I know everyone hair is different but that seems like alot of products you are applying to your hair . How often do you wash your hair?  Do you use a cleansing shampoo?
bdwgamer,ruaujr,"Moisturizing&&&Sooo I moisturize my hair daily with Pantene Gold Butter Creme and conditioner after applying a homemade conditioning detangler. I don’t do it for definition, I do it to get rid of my bonnet hair and pillow hair, as well as give it moisture. Am I doing something wrong?&&&I cowash weekly and use a cleansing shampoo monthly. I mainly use the creams to help my hair get detangled better, although I don’t have the time to completely detangle it every morning"
etherealmeadows,ruaujr,Yes..sorry to say but you only need to moisturize your hair once a week by shampooing and conditioning water = Hydration
Duhneeka1,ru299e,What do you use in your hair when it’s flat ironed?&&&I have never had a successful press ever! What do you all suggest? My hair gets poofy after a day. I don’t know if it matters much but I have 3c in the back 4a everywhere else.&&&Oh wow no product at all? How long does it last for you?&&&Oooh thank you I’ll go scout for that. I feel like my hair might be high porosity so I’m hoping this does it
nesquikb,ru299e,My mom always used Mizani products when she straightened our hair and we’d be good for like 2 weeks if we wrapped it at night and stayed out of the rain/really humid weather!
popcornnhero,ru299e,"I typically don’t add any product in it. If I go out early in the morning when it’s humid, I keep it covered in a bonnet and head wrapped . If I’m the house I might wear it down or pull it into a ponytail and tie a headband on it.  Do you live in a humid climate or move around a lot (I try to avoid working out too cause my roots will revert just like that)"
wstmrlnd1,ru299e,I use the chase method while flat ironing and then smooth in some Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade when I’m done.
rebeccasingsong,ru1rhr,"Free form locs?&&&Thinking of getting free form locs because I’m tired of spending $200+ to do my hair every month and taking it down to wash and back again. It’s painful at times anyway and I don’t think synthetic hair is good for my scalp condition.

Anywho, I’ve done some research about it and apparently you just wash your hair and let it loc in about 3-4 weeks. But some sources says washing it too often and moisturizing it can prevent it from locking it as it’s softening the hair. Which advice is correct? I need to take my hair out soon and plan to wrap my hair up during the locking process which I’m also wondering is a smart choice. Tips?"
Greeneyesdontlie85,rtx645,My hair was basically the same! I used wild growth oil and kept my hair in two strand twists for a week or two at a time- I also detangle in the shower with steam as much as possible that’s really helps me
chap10rian,rtx645,"tired of my hair..&&&&&&don't know what happened to it but I made a long post about it. Basically saying how I want to learn to put my hair in protective styles because I cut my hair in October 2016, it's january 2022 and I still have probably grown an inch and half 2 inches tops i think in the past 4-5 years. My hair breaks off. Not sure what my hair type is, for a while I thought 3c but someone told me it is likely 4a.&&&my hair was able to grow long in braids every month but i can't afford that and often times i have to be lucky enough to have met a friend who will do it cheaply or for free. i want to learn to box braids."
scbbK,rtx645,"You poor thing! You have such beautiful hair. I'm inclined to say it's 3C (I have 3C), but, regardless, your hair has so much potential. I thought about whether you need any protein treatments, but your curl pattern seems strong (what are your thoughts?). If it's mostly an issue with physical damage, it sounds like you have the right idea about protective styles. Besides box braids, you may consider other styles that you can do more immediately. You wrote that you wear your hair mostly in a low ponytail, so your ends are getting exposed to environmental and physical elements. Consider tucking them in with some pins? And at night, maybe try a pineapple so you aren't rolling around on your ends? Just a couple of immediate solutions I thought might help."
BeautyOfaWolf,rtwp1a,"I would say listen to your scalp. I wash when my scalp says it's time! Whether that be multiple times a week, once a week, once a month etc, but I try to wash it at least once every 1-2 weeks. If your scalp is itchy, feels too oily, stiff, dry etc then give it what it needs. Everyone's hair is different. Just make sure u moisturize properly. If I want to stretch my washes then I do an acv rinse or an aloe vera rinse. I stopped using shampoos and conditioners years ago. Now my wash days consist of pre-moisturizing with oils, washing with raw african black soap then deep conditioning with raw aloe vera straight from the leaf & again applying my oils afterwards for moisture. If u want length retention as someone else said, wash then style it and leave it alone for a week or more. When I was really focusing on growing my daughter's hair, I kept my daughter's hair in 2 strand twists (no rubber bands or tension) for 2-4 weeks at a time in between wash days & within 1 year of this consistent routine, her hair went from shoulder length to past the middle of her back! It's even longer now. Less is more sometimes!! Hope this helps ❤️"
Blaque-Cat,rtwp1a,"Once every 7-10 days minimum. It’s also unnecessary and causing buildup to apply products to your hair every day. Style your hair after you shampoo and condition it, then leave it alone for the week."
BuffyTheVodkaDrinker,rtwp1a,I wash my hair twice a week but I'm thinking of returning back to washing only once a week just because I'm fed up of washing again mid week ha ha
JessicaSmith3790,rtwp1a,"The less you wash your hair the less water damage you're gonna cause on your hair, so in my opinion, washing the hair every 7 days is the best, however, I'm super aware that not everybody can do this. So I think a healthy range to wash your hair is in between 3 to 4 days, that would be ideal."
LamakD,rtwp1a,I was 4 or 5 times a week
Spadarlvl1000,rtwp1a,"How often should you wash your hair in a week?(M) asking. I used to get it washed once a week but I'm curious(experience wise), how often should natural hair be washed?&&&My S/O thought me so far how to keep and groom my natural hair, but I'll like to know what the standard is on how many times natural hair should be washed. I put in products every other day, just wondering when and how often natural hair should be washed, experience wise.&&&Okay nice, this is extremely helpful. I've always put products in every other day. Thanks so much.&&&Okay nice! Thanks for the advice, much appreciated. I don't do so well with oils but I'm totally game for some moisturising. Once a week sounds good.&&&Lol tell me about it, it's so stressful but so rewarding to be honest. Once a week sounds really good."
flyingbrownies,rtwp1a,"i wash mine once a week as well. sometimes once every two weeks if i get too lazy to take out my twists, which is not ideal but it is what it is. i feel like when your hair and scalp are dry and maybe even flaky and itchy, youre lacking moisture. you can use oils for sure in between washes but it definitely builds up if you use it regularly. so once a week is the best for my natural hair as ive come to find over the years! anything more would be too much and too drying on a regular basis, for me anyway!"
Adriianaa_,rtwot1,Go cry u a river if you think that that is much
Certain_Spinach_8237,rtwot1,Maam when I tell you this is a hair ball compared to the amount I lose after a month of braids 🤣✋🏾 it’s normal don’t worry 💕💕
ChanChan452,rtwot1,Is this not normal? My Afro has this much of shedding when I take down my braids. “I keep good care of my hair”
Dandie24,rtwot1,This is normal. Our hair shed 50-100 strands a day. Don’t worry.
Kishiloh,rtwot1,Thats normal
LuminousMizar,rtwot1,Y’all I’m so sad. I took down some 1 1/2-2month braids and a few of them were VERY tangled I spent all day undoing it and this is most of the hair that I lost.&&&&&&i guess it is&&&im abt to do twists lol
Omega_Tree,rtwot1,We shed about 100 hairs a day
PrTYlaDY90,rtwot1,This is about what I lost after detangling after 5dsys....damn post partem hair loss
cherryafrodite,rtwot1,"Nahh this is pretty normal. Our hair sheds everyday so if you have protective styles in, the shed hair just gonna stay there. I have about this much hair after 1 month/5 weeks. 

A way I try to gauge how much hair per week was being lost was by seperating the shedded hair into equal amounts of hair for however long I had my protective style in. So 5 weeks = I'd seperate the shedded into 5 groups of hair lol. Doing that shows that I was losing a healthy amount per week.

Now, this amount of hair WOULD be abnormal if OP said this was only 2 days of shedded hair. That'd be concerning"
cxnxria,rtwot1,"after not detangling it for 2 months, this is a roughly healthy amount of hair loss! our hair sheds a normal amount every day/week, so it just has built up over time."
gtfopx,rtwot1,That’s a normal amount of hair
redbattleaxe,rtwot1,Unless your hair is very very short I wouldn't worry.
wooweeitszea,rtwot1,With some TLC your hair will bounce back! Maybe rock some twists for a bit or another low manipulation style.
Affectionate_Face_71,rtwlz1,I agree. More important things to know are porosity and density. Knowing these are so much more helpful to healthy hair and products that you need to buy. Your curl type might be the same. But is your density and porosity the same? These two things are key for buying products that will work for you
ChickenDumpli,rtwlz1,"Ha! I just said this too. This part.&&&'What's my curl type?' is the new 'I got Indian blood.' 

Now, I know I know...it's not that way for everyone, lol - I'm sure some are sincere...but for many, it's kind of a pathology we're dealing with as Black folk, but out in the open on social media.

I don't even buy the whole, 'I need to know my 'curl type,' to buy the right products,' BS.  I shop A LOT, and I've never seen products labeled 4a, 3c, 4b or 4c.  As someone correctly points out in this topic, it's all about porosity, and other things moreso than what kind of 'curl.'  

That's why I'm glad that 'mixed chicks,' brand seems to be fading by the wayside.  It came out early on, and I really felt it was separatist. lol  Like it was saying, 'we ain't like y'all, we got that good hair - so here's our product that's not for you.'  Then I went natural myself a few years later, and well, well, well whaddya know...turns out what y'all thought was 'special,' really isn't just your domain now is it?

If you have a head of healthy hair, that is the true GOOD hair.  Fck a curl type.  Most people have a number of different types on their head anyway...let it go.  Just report back on detangling, and slip and good conditioners and hairstyles."
Dylanspencer13,rtwlz1,"I agree! We need to post other ways to look at hair—porosity, density, thickness, and health of hair which should be the focus!"
Elephant-Charm,rtwlz1,"The thing is, you don’t need to know your hair type to manage it. All you have to do is take a shampoo, use it and figure out if you liked the experience and move on with the rest of the products because hair in the same category can act differently in response to product. You just have to do your hair and that way you’ll learn your hair.&&&I’ve tried so many products recommended to be good for people with type 4. None really worked like I needed it to. You won’t know what’s good for you until you test it out on your head. Hair typing doesn’t matter bc you’ll understand YOUR hair’s needs."
Embarrassed_Cow,rtwlz1,"Its nuts because those with 4c hair seem to have the most beautiful, thick hair I've ever seen. Their twists are so juicy. But I understand the maintenance has to be awful."
Esqornot,rtwlz1,This. Exactly!
HousePlantPappi,rtwlz1,"YES PLEASE. Mods....please make this a rule. New naturals are always interested (......obsessed) in knowing what they're hair type is and as someone who's been natural 10 years it's not useful information at all.  My hair might be the same ""hair type"" to another hair influencer, but the products that work on her hair won't work on mine or vice versa. Also your ""hair type"" might change with the length of your hair or product type.  It's just useless information it's like knowing someone's astrological sign (don't fight me). It's not going to help you do anything actually.   Posters would be better off asking how to achieve a certain style while providing a picture of their current hair.&&&Then i think the the post should be more specific in asking ""Which clip ins match my hair"".  the hair typing system isn't standardized so just bc the clip ins you buy say they're 4a doesn't mean they'll match your hair because some people on the internet said your hair 4a."
IamAMERICANFIRST,rtwlz1,"I have to say I’m not mad at this post. I also hope those that are seeking hair type, are also trying to determine their hair porosity because that has value too."
Jadeee-1,rtwlz1,"Agreed. It’s so exhausting and while hair type isn’t as important as porosity, it’s something a quick Google search can tell you *insert eye roll*"
Lacasadelmango,rtwlz1,"Can we leave ""what's my hair type?"" posts in 2021, please? :(&&&I want to start by saying I understand why many people who are new to being natural/just did a big chop may believe curl type/hair type is so important. We've been fed that chart for years and so many blogs and YouTubers still use it. 

But I find these posts so frustrating. If you go on the curly hair sub, you rarely see posts asking about curl type. I feel like the natural hair community was hijacked years ago - it went from its original purpose which was to celebrate Black hair and help people learn how to take care of it to obsession about curl pattern and curl definition which is honestly the least important part of taking care of your hair. 

I come to this sub for tips and to help others learn and be confident in their hair. Our community *really* needs to move away from this fixation on curl type. It's really just a caste system that was literally created to sell products. 

Anyone else feel the same?&&&EXACTLY THIS.&&&Exactly, I hate that a lot of these posts equate 4C with damaged.&&&Learning my porosity and density definitely helped me. But what helped me the most was learning what ingredients my hair liked and didn't like. I know my hair loves aloe and marshmallow root. My hair hates whatever is in wet line xtreme and eco styler so I avoid products that have similar ingredients.&&&Is it really though? I have mostly ""4a"" hair, so does one of my friends. Some products she uses on her hair don't work on me AT ALL and vice versa. I've also used products based on YouTubers whose curl pattern looks similar to mine and have wasted so much money doing so. I know a lot of people say this but I really don't think it's true."
Lelemcgeegee,rtwlz1,👏🏾 YASSSS
Lioness_805,rtwlz1,Thank you for saying this! I stopped typing my hair years ago because it never fit in any of the categories I believed it should have. It’s completely misleading. My hair is taken care of the best it can without using this unnecessary chart
LivePossible,rtwlz1,Same. Also figuring out that my fine coily hair has specific needs was way more beneficial than the 4a/4b designation.
M_Sia,rtwlz1,I have type 4 hair and definition is not a priority at all. I actually find when I focus on moisturizing my hair without the focus on definition its way healthier than when I focused on defined curls. I feel like saying definition matters for tighter curl textures is saying that our nature curl pattern isn’t enough and we have to seek to manipulate our hair into being more defined or the look of having looser curls.&&&I used to defend it saying it does matter but honestly it’s useless please focus on other things 🤦🏾‍♀️ Density or porosity just please
Misisme20,rtwlz1,"or the opposite with folks want to be part of ""team 4C"" for ""other"" external validations.&&&I mean learning your natural curl pattern aids in styling options. If you have looser hair, volume tends to matter. If you have tighter hair, definition tends to matter. Not all styles are protective styles.


But i do understand the frustration&&&something to consider is that your base curl may look one way but after products (which water technically counts as) and styles may look another way. If you have fine hair and anything medium to high porosity your hair will look looser because its being weighed down more. Type 4 hair has small coils and kinks, that is a base line."
Nadaleenatasha,rtwlz1,THANK YOU
NoireN,rtwlz1,"Curl typing isn't really important, but neither is porosity, unless you're getting your hair colored. Porosity changes all the time, and most people who think they have ""low porosity"" it's actually because they are suffocating their hair with unnecessary product.&&&That's really what it is. I used to be in a few natural hair groups back in the day and so many women who obviously had product in their hair and did a twist out were asking what their hair type was, while lying about having no product in their hair 😂&&&So I read that book as a teenager and his recommendation for type 4 hair is to relax it. Totally helped to damage my self esteem when I was unable to get relaxers done in a timely manner.&&&I just want to point out that over two decades ago I read Andre Walker's book about curl patterns (the one where he said type 4 hair can only be ""managed"" by relaxing it)"
Numerous_Win_1123,rtwlz1,I agree. I scroll right past those posts because they’re so annoying. Everyone just needs to worry about their porosity and density cause knowing that info is gonna lead them to finding the proper products they should be using for moisture. I don’t see how knowing your curl pattern could be important unless you want to figure out what kind of gel/styler would enhance your curls the most..
Ok-Avocado464,rtwlz1,"This is so true. Knowing your curly type does little to actually help you, people should instead be looking for their hairs porosity, moisture retention, etc"
PeachBlossomBee,rtwlz1,"I just think they’re annoying. You can figure it out with wet hair, a mirror, and a chart"
PrincessTiaraLove,rtwlz1,"These people that want to ""leave hair typing behind"" mean can 4c's just please stop trying to be exclusive. Lets be real. The only people that benefit from hair typing is people with 4c hair type. It helps us do things they said we'd never be able to do like have long healthy hair and it also creates a community they they can't feel special in, because it so call excludes them even though historically and currently people with 4c hair have been excluded. Most ladies on r/blackladies are 4c so if you need a space them come join us over there.  Also learn your hair porosity too, because it really helps figure out what type of products you should use. just take a strand of your hair and put it in a cup of water and if it floats its low porosity, if it sinks its high porosity and if it stays in the middle its more neutral."
Understanding_Naive,rtwlz1,i agree and disagree that curl type is not important but hair type is very important when it comes to your hair regime. low porosity/high porosity; fine and coarse; etc are much more important than curl types.
Urikalynn_,rtwlz1,I have no clue what my hair type his but finding my porosity was way more important lol makes finding out which products work for my hair way easier
Yuethemoonspirit1,rtwlz1,"I feel that's a little unfair. As a baby natural that can really help with a first step in knowing what your hair can look like. While the hair type system is flawed it gives a good base of where to start.  knowing your curl pattern showed up in the the last decade or so. Before that it was just good hair and nappy hair. And as someone who has 4c hair I feel specially looking for products or reviews based on that helps. Even 4b hair is vastly different and can't really be compared with 4c. And some people have multiple types in their head and need help. 

What makes me angry is people tagging their hair type 4 just to be ambiguous when it's clear you have 3c/4a hair"
ZeDitto,rtwlz1,"> Anyone else feel the same?

Yes. 100%"
acbutler1234,rtwlz1,It’s so frustrating that 4c is considered unattractive and the “worst” hair type to have on these type of posts. Women with the loosest curls will cry that their hair is unmanageable and hard to take care of so it MUST be 4c. What’s up with that?&&&Someone that knows what she’s talking about!
asheyy_,rtwlz1,Whewwwww you hit it on the head!&&&That part!
buttzini,rtwlz1,"It’s also kinda important to know when you’re getting a hair cut and you want to know how your curls will lay on your head. I definitely think curl typing can be problematic, but whenever I get my hair shaped, googling “3c/4a hair cuts” is the only search that gives my looks that are attainable on my hair.

I also think it’s important to admire hair that looks like yours when transitioning. I grew up only really following models with straight hair or relaxers. I love all hair types, but it was nice figuring out what my hair might look like and following people that made it look beautiful. At the time, only my roots were curly and I wouldn’t have been able to tell my hair texture without asking others. I became a lot more excited when I started following people that looked like me and were embraced for their hair, especially after being told to hate it for so many years. Idk. These considerations do not dismiss the texturism/featurism that often comes with hair typing, but I don’t think the chart is completely useless and only harmful by any means."
cynicaloreo,rtwlz1,"The only reason curl type would be important is if you are re creating style. It would look different on a 3B curl diameter vs 4B.

Other than that, use some leave in, curl cream, and be done.

We’re keeping long and unnecessary hair routines in 2021."
eggdeadhead,rtwlz1,I completely agree with you. I also think the hair typing has been somewhat taken over by a lot of non POC with loose/bigger curls who type themselves as 3b/c or even type 4 hair types so it becomes confusing when people with tighter curls try typing their hair or look for styles with those hair types. I think hair type is only relevant when you’re trying to describe what you look like or you’re looking for curly hairstyles and want to see the hairstyles on someone with a similar hair texture to yours.
fivetenash,rtwlz1,I have a whole housekeeping post stickied at the top of the subreddit you should check out…
fruitybubblegum,rtwlz1,"I usually agree with this, but I think knowing your hair type is good if you want to buy matching hair extensions or see what styles would go well with your hair. I’ve been browsing a lot of sites for clip ins and struggling to see what would go well with mine since I recently bc’d."
gigismother,rtwlz1,100%
ismololo,rtwlz1,"People want to know their curl type so they can figure out what would work best for them. If I want a particular hair cut/style, I Google how similar cuts/styles would look with someone with my hair. It’s also good to know porosity etc so you can figure out which products work best. 

Can we leave shaming people for wanting to understand their hair type in 2021."
justasmolbean__,rtwlz1,What would you say are some essential characteristics to know about your natural hair then? I personally could never figure out curl type or porosity and would love to leave them both behind lol
likeheywassuphello,rtwlz1,PLEASE GOD!!!!
ndilapha,rtwlz1,"Firstly,  Happy New Year, lovelies! 🍀🥂💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
I've said this before,  it is one of my wishes. I have no problem with a hair typing day. If people need it, I'm not here to deny them. Just not every day.
I think the obsession with length (and envy of perceived 'beautiful hair') is behind a lot of these..."
omgidfk123,rtwlz1,"To me, hair typing doesn't give you anything but a letter and number. I feel it stops people from learning their hair, they just assume its does whatever the hairtyping label says it does and we fall for bad products and cashgrabs because it says 4c or whatever on it. And the history behind the system is just another point against it, I say we leave it in the past."
popcornnhero,rtwlz1,I think knowing your curl pattern is helpful in determining what products is right for your hair.
redbattleaxe,rtwlz1,"Honestly... if it was used properly I think it could be a little helpful.

A lot of people going natural have no idea where to begin and a lot of the more important things like ""texture"" ""porosity"" ""density"" may be very difficult to understand until they've had some experience in their hair. 

I've actually read Andre walkers book and you can tell it's there as a guide for noobies. He says if your hair look like this, it's 4a, and this is hoe you care for it, Some styles that work, Methods, how often to wash, etc, etc. 

I think its turned into a caste system. But if people were using his book I think they would see it's meant to help new people. And then over time you would then learn the other more important traits. I also believe that's why some of the hair types are ""missing"" because you can care for some types the same/similar. 

That's just my 2 cents.

I think we should allow people to ask about hair type so they can go research that type online for help and then educate them on other traits as well. 

I just remember being natural in the beginning and a lot of these terms were iver my head but 3b 4b was easy. But I also had his book so it did help."
rowannmic,rtwlz1,I agree wholeheartedly. Especially since so many of these posts just come off as folks seeking external validation that their hair is not 4C.
simplybreana,rtwlz1,"Maaaaan I could care less what type of curl or whatever my hair is, all I care about is if my hair feels and looks healthy and if my relationship to my hair is healthy. 

I am on a continuous journey discovering what works and what doesn’t because my hair is changing as I age and products change and get discontinued or are out of stock… so I’m always just doing the best I can. Plus, my hair is multiple curl types and textures and colors and unless they got a VERY specific chart, no chart is going to tell me what my hair needs. And I feel like most people have unique hair anyway so what works for one may not work for another. It’s all trial and error and building a good relationship with your hair."
sisyphus753,rtwlz1,"I agree! It’s very frustrating how big of a deal it seems to be, especially when it’s not *that* important in haircare. As a ‘type 4’, I think I only use it to Google hairstyle ideas that I will never actually be able to do myself lol. I think that a lot of the natural hair care routine etc has been way overcomplicated for most people and hair type is a big part of that. All for leaving it behind!"
wj2smooth,rtwlz1,This one ☝️
ybn_suley,rtwlz1,I asked that yesterday on r/blackhair and people were saying my hair is 3B 😭 my hair is no where near as loose as that (i’d say my hair is 3C on my hairline and the rest is 4A) and people were saying 3B 💀 my curls are not the width of a sharpie and never have been.
