Dahliacid,b7pkpq,"You don't need to chop off what u have unless u feel like it's super damaged or u just simply want to. You should do some research on the type of products you wanna use or look at reviews or find someone with natural hair silar to use. Once u figure that out u can decide what products work for u. As for protective styles there's alot of videos of that on YouTube: corn rows, individual braids, finger coils etc. There are actually a couple of male youtubers who have hair care videos. "
blackskinhead89,b7pkpq,Helppppppp&&&I am a black man and after 5 years of cutting my hair bald I have in the past 6 weeks started growing out my hair. Idk what I want to do with it yet but I do know I want my hair to be healthy and live to its fullest potential until I figure out what natural hairstyle I want. So I feel like I'm already too late since I started growing it out 6 weeks ago. I don't do much with my hair but use head and shoulders when I take a shower for my dandruff. Sooooo what do I do? Where do I start? Should I cut my six week year old hair now and start over again since I haven't used any oils or something from the beginning?? Does me being a black man mean that I have a different procedure for my hair than a black woman? I'm just lost....maybe I should go back to shaving my head if I'm not doing it the right way because idk wtf is going on....I may just cry about it tonight Haha 
hwkitty,b7pkpq,"you're overthinking it man! you'll be fine working with what you got. i promise i have treated my hair less than ideally (i.e. very badly) for long periods of time and i have healthy hair today after fixing that.

hair care does not differ b/w men and women. it's true that women tend to try to grow their hair so many youtubers are female but that's it. 

you'll need to figure out your hair porosity, you can google or look on youtube to find out how. hair type is a controversial topic at times but if you can find someone who has your hair type approximately, you can use their routine as a starting point.

then-- this is the important part-- start to figure out what works for YOU individually, because even if someone's hair looks exactly like yours, sometimes there's one ingredient, technique, etc. that won't agree with you.

don't worry about buying tons of products either. i use about 3 storebought products (shampoo, deep conditioner, shea butter mix), water, and 2 oils in my routine so don't get too caught up in any brand's hype. you can use the best products in the world but if ya technique ain't right, you won't retain your growth.

it's all about keeping yr hair moisturized (and sometimes protein balanced which has never been an issue for me, so i can't really speak on it) so it can be healthy and grow!

good luck! "
WillowLei,b7opax,How to style/take care of 3c bangs?&&&I’m thinking of getting bangs to chop off the rest of the heat damage toward the front of my hair. How do y’all style your curly bangs? Any techniques & products to recommend?
sweetbbjayne,b7opax,"I have 3C bangs. They are about 6 inches long not stretched. I just do a leave in conditioner and after a shower I put gel in my bangs in sections, like the rest of my hair. I then separate my hair into a natural middle part, without separating the curls. So the middle part comes out not perfectly straight, but you can’t tell because of the curls. "
KayyxKayy,b7o3ss,"Neep Help with Hair Thinning&&&So to keep this brief, my hair constantly thins out on the back of my head near the nape of my neck. I know it's due to me constantly stressing out so it begins to thin. But what do you guys recommend to keep my hair thick and to help it to continue to grow in the back?"
Nesscaloo,b7o38r,"Hair product recommendations?&&&I have low porosity 4C hair and I use Herbal Essences Hello Hydration conditioner for pretty much everything. It moisturizes my hair like nothing else I've ever used. 

I'd like to support black owned businesses and I'm looking for something that would have the same effect as Hello Hydration. My hair doesn't like oils (except for olive oil) or Cantu products.

If anyone has any recommendations for something that might work for me I'd really appreciate it!"
Ace_Turnip,b7n5xo,"Ridiculous issue with tangles&&&I have medium length (APL-BSL) type 4 hair, and these days my hair's been a nightmare. I trimmed it less than a month ago, but my hair's been tangling like crazy (big knots and matted hair), even when stretched. I use a wide tooth comb for detamglimg but my family's now telling me that the comb isn't thorough enough. 

What do you guys think about using a detamgling brush on type 4 hair? My hair's low to medium porosity, and high demsity with strands ranging from fine to coarse. &&&My ends aren't dry; i dont let my hair dry out very much. I moisturize every 2 days by spraying my hair with hot water, adding a light leave in and sealing with my whipped shea butter mixture. I always add more water and product to my ends compared to the rest of my hair. &&&It could be! I use head n shoulders shampoo once a week but i usually try to concentrate it on my scalp only. I might try mixing it with a more moisturizing shampoo&&&No, my hair is completely natural. No heat damage either. &&&Do you find that you have more breakage with the denman? And what kind of hair do you have?"
FemmeCaraibe,b7n5xo,"Was your hair chemically processed in anyway? I bleached and highlighted my hair three times in the period of two months, and after that it was game over. My hair began to shed and tangle like crazy. No matter what I did nothing could save it. I took the plunge and cut it all off. Try going to a professional hairdresser to see if they can help you. Perhaps an olaplex treatment can be done, as well as a cut/shape to help reduce tangling in your hair."
lteesh,b7n5xo,"Do your ends feel drier than usual? Dry ends tend to knot and tangle like crazy, and the longer our hair grows, the trickier it can be to maintain soft, moisturized ends. If you aren’t already, make sure you’re regularly spritzing your ends with water or a water-based spray, then sealing in the moisture with an oil. Hope that helps!"
moonchild2998,b7n5xo,"I was using the wrong shampoo. I was using a clarifying shampoo every time I washed, which was drying out my hair! It dried out my ends more than usual, which cause the tangles and breaks :( I switched my shampoo from the Cantu Cleansing Cream to the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey And Yogurt shampoo and stopped getting such bad tangles. Maybe that could be it? "
onlymolly,b7n5xo,"I get the same issue. Try a Denman brush, it changed my life!! I trim my ends, heavily moisturize and put them in two stand twists for about a month. "
Xxxholic835xxX,b7hr07,I bought two of the sets. The price had me excited since I've never seen Cantu that cheap. 
misszoeline,b7hr07,"Target helped set me up for most of the year!!&&&Y’all. The Target near me had these Cantu gift boxes with FULL SIZED PRODUCTS on clearance for *seven. dollars.* (pic in comments) I normally pay $5.99 just for the regular jar of the coconut curling cream, and the one in this box is 4oz bigger!! Plus they had a special at Target where you get a $5 gift card when you buy $20 in beauty products, so I basically got all this for $16. 😵 And since i already had some products on hand and I’m good on shampoo and deep conditioners, I shouldn’t need to buy any more for at least 6 months. 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾&&& https://i.imgur.com/CaGyCs7.jpg https://i.imgur.com/HxWt50a.jpg &&&My hair and I love it!

I’ve always seen that product but I’ve never actually tried it, so I’m glad the price was so low that I could get that much of it. I actually just used it to re-twist my hair last night and I really like it. "
princess_myshkin,b7hr07,"Ooh, I’ll have to check out target tomorrow now. I’ve never seen the kits at mine, maybe I missed them. How do you like the coconut curl cream? I been wanting to try it, I use the curl activator cream now, but I feel like I could use some more moisture. "
skeevangogh,b7hr07,"I did the same thing. Ours was down to $4 lol, I have sooooo much it's not even funny. "
IWantMyBachelors,b7gtbv,"Am I Doing Something Wrong?&&&I wash my hair once a week. I just started using the Maui hair products, so far I’m using their shampoo, conditioner, and hair spray. I’ve also started using one of those silicone hair brushes.

When my nails are wet, they’re weak and flexible and can’t wash my hair very thoroughly. That’s why I use the hair brush. I also use Haitian castor oil in my scalp twice a week, I make sure to warm it up so my scalp can do a better job of absorbing it.

Even with all this, I still get patches of dandruff on my scalp. It’s mostly near my forehead and by my ears. Does anyone experience this as well?

Oh! I almost forgot, my hair type is between a 3C and 4A and it’s pretty thick, if that helps at all.&&&I’ll try that! Thank you!"
MisSinterpreter123,b7gtbv,"🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️First, type doesn't matter. That's part of your problem. Too many people, especially new naturals, assume type determines what products you use. Figure out your porosity in order to properly moisturize hair. 
Second, why are you using hair spray? There's no reason to put hair spray in your hair. It's drying. It's most likely leading to build up and dandruff. Instead of hairspray, use a leave in conditioner, oil and cream. You want to moisturize your hair and prepare it for styling. Look at the ingredients in the Maui products. 
Third, you need to see a doctor about your nails. Don't use your fingernails when you wash your hair, rub your scalp with the pads of your fingers. When you deep condition, hit your ends first and work your way up. The scalp doesn't need to be deep conditioned but you can put a small amount of conditioner near the roots. "

tianiawise,b7fwbk,Thin Curly Hair Routine&&&[removed]
BoxedBoobs,b7e5pu,After you co-wash what do you use to style? Do you pre-poo or legit just wash it daily and go?
TiaNix,b7e5pu,That’s awesome!
cynicaloreo,b7e5pu,"I daily cowash as well. I have mostly 3C, with some 3b in the front. I was nervous to daily cowash and wet my hair because people said I would get hydral fatigue. Been doing it for a month now and my hair is flourishing. Curls are super defined with just water but I use curling jelly to set so it won’t frizzy during the day. I big chopped last month and my hair is growing so fast my mom was shocked when she saw it on FaceTime. That goes to show do what is best for your hair. You don’t have to follow the “rules”. It’s all about experimenting with what regime and products work for your. Glad you found yours!"
gnuckifubuck,b7e5pu,"Daily cowashing update: 2 weeks&&&I made a post here a while ago about wetting or cowashing my natural hair daily, and how I was getting good results. Right after that post, I went back to my braids, because my mom was advising against it and I didn't want to do anything else with it.

I was really careful about moisturizing them though, and my hair was in better condition--not nearly as dry or crackly--when I took them back out. But I started daily cowashing again, with a big bottle of Suave conditioner, switching it up sometimes with sulfate free shampoos and clay washes.

My hair is NEVER dry and crunchy anymore, and is defined no matter what I put on it. I can do real wash and goes now. It takes me only 15 minutes a day to cowash, maybe 5 to style if I'm not defining my curls out all the way and if I want a nice coily fro (admittledly, it's a lot more--maybe 20-30 if I am looking or curls). It takes like two minutes to detangle--in fact, my looser textures never tangle at all.

When I first started, I had a TON of single strand knots, because I needed a trim. I cut them out (they were at the ends) but didn't fully trim my hair. They did not return, to my immense surprise. My hair pretty much completely stopped breaking when wet, and there is absolutely no breakage when my hair is styled dry. It's also so much more manageable? I can actually corral my now -armpit length and extremely high density hair into 12-14 braids. 

This technique also allowed me to find out my true texture. Turns out my hair isn't 4a/b/c. I have no 4b or 4c strands on my head at all, and in fact, like 60% of my head is 3c, with a small piece of 3b in the very middle back. My crown is pretty much a loose 4a. The very front of my head is also 3c. So I was really out here false claiming 4c. I didn't think my hair was tighter because it was dry and damaged--it looked moisturized, healthy and thick, it just didn't have a curl pattern. Now that I'm seeing my hair wet and dry all the time, I realized that a lot of my hair had bigger coils than any 4c hair I'd ever seen--coils that would define with just water. And large parts of my hair didn't coil at all, rather had curls as thick as my finger. 

My hair has also been drying a lot faster. Not drying out, but reaching its dry and defined state in a matter of a few hours instead of 24, like it did before. My hair is low-porosity, so this is a huge plus and a change for me. 

My hair was never soft before. It has coarse strands, so it will never feel baby-fine and plush, but now it feels passably soft even when fully dry (as long as I avoid coconut oil!)

I plan to incorporate a protein treatment when I have the money, but for right now, this is it, chief.

tl:dr I'm going to keep cowashing my multi-textured, coarse, low porosity hair daily until it stops working for me.&&&ooh, what curling jelly do you use? when i feel like defining, I use Eco on top of a leave in, but I don't like the crunch or the amount of product I have to use. &&&I use Suave Naturals Coconut, because it's 2$ for 30oz&&&i just put in leave in conditioner and shea butter. i don't prepoo."
tjeanite,b7e5pu,That's amazing! Congrats! What do you use for your cowash?
BigBlackGothBitch,b7dn7g,"The proteins in a banana are much too large to penetrate the hair shaft, so that wouldn’t be her issue here unless her products delivered too much of some type of hydrolyzed protein. "
ladyAnder,b7dn7g,"I read the ingredient list of that product and usage, that stuff is used for strengthening your hair. Basically it's full of proteins and things that strength hair. 

Bananas provide protien. Not sure about the bamboo extract. It has silica in it that can strength hair and nails but I don't think it's a protien. I need to research that at some point. "
tranquiltb,b7dn7g,"What in the world happened???&&&So today was wash day... 

Last night I sprayed my hair with Aloe Vera and water. Then, I did an hot oil treatment with coconut oil and a little bit of grape seed oil. I woke up, rinsed my hair then shampooed once with Orchid and White Truffle by Hask then did a couple washes with Cantu. After that I used a banana and bamboo deep conditioner pack by ORS.

I always wash my hair in sections. After I did everything above I started to take out a section to blow it out and it feels rougher than ever!!! Before I blow dry I use JBCO, Olive oil, and Shea Butter. But I could barely get my comb and brush through it.. The only thing I added/changed was that banana and   bamboo conditioner. I only use coconut oil for my hot oil treatment because I get to wash it out. I don’t use it to oil my scalp because how it makes my hair unmanageable and doesn’t moisturize my scalp for too long. 

What may have made my hair so rough and hard to manage? 

Are bananas or bamboo protein ? &&&Thank you soo much! I tried to research information about it but all I was getting was how banana is good for moisturizing the hair but after using that product my hair didn’t feel that way. "
WillowLei,b7cfdj,"Have you enough tried using a denman brush? Whenever I use it I get much more shrinkage than usual, so that may help your hair look less stretched!"
lulumajorca,b7cfdj,"You need a real protein treatment! Even though eggs have protein the molecules aren't small enough to penetrate the hair shaft so just get a store bought conditioner that lists hydrolyzed protein, collagen or keratin. Your homemade treatment is essentially just conditioner. 

I'm not the biggest fan of homemade treatments just because there's actually real chemistry that goes behind making conditioners since they're formulated to lower the ph levels of hair. Without a science background its hard to determine if you're helping or hurting your hair but if your set on making something yourself you can purchase pure hydrolyzed protein from amazon and add a few teaspoons to your favourite conditioner, per the instructions. 
"
satan_little_helper,b7cfdj,"Easily stretched hair. Help!!!&&&I have a multitude of hair textures in my head, ranging from 3C to 4B. In addition to that, I have pretty thin hair, as in my hair strands, not my overall head. This leads to my hair being straightened very easily, even without heat, by simply me twisting or braiding it. I can never do a twist or braid out because of this, because it looks like my hair has no volume due to it being so easy to stretch. Are there any tips for this?

I honestly think it might be just genetics, so if nothing works, nothing works. I tend to do wash n' (dont because it's a million steps) go with some Eco and the LCO method, which gives me some beautiful curls, albeit a bit of a mess since my hair textures are in sections, but I make it work. This is the only way I can get a semblance of volume out of my hair. 

I doubt my hair is damaged. The only thing I've used one it is a hair straightener and that has been 3 times in 6 years. Before that, I had a mini big chop. I've been doing homemade protein treatments about once a month, but those haven't made a dent in anything.

1 whole egg

ButteryBakedSalmon,b7835l,"never touching a protein treatment again!&&&Hey yall

!So im somewhere between 3B / 3C on the natural hair chart. My hair has never been touched by chemicals or heat either.. I'm also pretty sure im Low porosity.

I decided a week ago to put my first (and LAST!) protein treatment on my hair. so i bought the ""NANGAI & TSUBAKI STRENGTH RESTORE PROTEIN TREATMENT"" from Camille Rose. washed my hair with clarifying shampoo (Tresemme Deep Cleanse Purify and Replenish) Then i detangled and put the treatment on. Stayed under the heat for like 30 minutes, and then put the leave in moisturizer on afterwards.

Letft my hair in chunky twist untouched for the next couple of days because i was super busy and stuff.

Friday (wash day) rolls around and i feel and see how awful my hair is! tried to put my hair in 4 section while dry, before i washed it. And it was so tangled...more than ever before in my life! And then i deep conditioned under heat with Eden Body Works Jojoba Monoi Deep Conditioner(protein free). And still my hair was...so dry and felt like hay.After doing research online that night, i finally figured out what most likely happened (protein overload).

The next day, i used the Tresemme Deep cleanse shampoo, then used that popular Indian Aztec clay, then after that i went in with Eden Body Works deep conditioner with heat. \*(i got this idea from researching how to fix this)\*My hair still felt dry and hard and crunchy!

Now (a whole week later), ive slept with my hair drenched in protein free moisturizers for the first two nights. I've deep conditioned twice this week as well.I think that helped with getting my hair back to being naturally soft again. My issues now are the frizzyness!! i never had that issue before this mess.  My ends are the worst! They are not split ends but they refuse to not tangle and fly away.. its as if they dont wanna stay together to form a uniform curl!

The rest of my head is...okay. Im having minimal breakage / shedding. and when i pull a hair strand..it stretches before it snaps.

&#x200B;

Ive been only using the very few protein free products i have (closest stores to me are pharmacies where the black hair shelf is full of shea moisture).

&#x200B;

**My Questions for Yall:**

* Did i wait too long to remedy this? it took me 10 days to realize something was wrong. i didnt manipulate my hair at all during those 10 days.
* is this still considered Protein Overload, even thought i have very little to no breakage? My strands arent snapping like most people describe. And my curls are not stretched or elongated, my curls just dont want to clump together too much and it still looks very frizzy while wet.
* Is this really reversible? I dont think my case is severe , but I've seen some people say it's better to just Big Chop *(id only consider this if a year passes and nothing has changed at all)*
* Would me doing the ""*baggy method*' every night for 3-4 hours be too much? some say it'll lead to hygral fatigue while others say it will fix protein overload faster.
* DID I REALLY JUST FRY MY HAIR WITH THIS PROTEIN TREATMENT, ONLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T USE A DEEP CONDITIONER AFTERWARDS?!?

I know its only technically been a week for me trying to fix this but im kinda freaking out. I feel like i ruined my hair!!!!

I had no idea it was MUST to deep condition after. I know its a fuck up, but i didn't expect it to be this bad! im devastated!!! I already had to Big Chop 5 years ago from being heat damaged by a hair stylist!! If my hair was above my shoulders, id just shave it.

***Only Products im using now (protein free)***:

* Eden Body Works JojOba Monoi Deep Conditioner
* Carols Daughters Hair Milk Original Leave-In Moisturizer
* Camille Rose Curl Love Moisture Milk
* Camille Rose Almond Jai Twisting Butter

_CoachMcGuirk,b7835l,"If you're low porosity what made you decide to do a protein treatment??

Also, Shea Moisture has a wonderful protein free shampoo and conditioner."
glodoll,b7835l,"Do not immediately use deep conditioner more than once a week or you will get moisture overload. You have to balance protein and moisture. Avoid protein and ingredients that behave like protein ingredients (coconut oil, panthenol, etc.) in all your hair products (shampoo, conditioner, stylers, gels, etc.) and only use a, preferrably, deep conditioner with protein once a month. Make sure to clarify once a week to remove the protein buildup and the buildup of other products that are coating your hair and preventing the moisturizing products from penetrating your hair strands. This is why your hair may feel dry and limp."
ladyAnder,b7835l,"You didn't wait too long to remedy this. Trying going on months of not realizing what the issue is. So no you didn't ruin your hair. Your hair will recover, it will be fine.

Possibly, most likely. The breakage doesn't get bad unless you continue on over-strengthening your hair and thinking more protien is the answer. Tis not. 

Yes it is, but it can take time just to get overall balance back. I mean just removing all offending products you will feel a difference. Just stay away from protein for a bit. But not forever. You can go from a protien overload to a having too much moisture. I would add protein back into your routine as say a deep conditioner and maybe a shampoo to start, but nothing your going to put in your hair every daily. This is what got me into trouble.  

I never did the baggy method to fix my protien overload. I didn't do any tricks or anything someone claimed to make it go away quicker. I just stopped using products that made everything worse and let moisture balance return. 

Maybe or it could be because your hair has enough protien already from the products you use and from your diet. That treatment was just way too much and threw your hair out of moisture balance. "
lulumajorca,b7835l,"It sounds like you didn't need protein in the first place so now your protein/moisture balance is out of whack. Mind you, protein overload is not the same thing as heat damage so just do whatever it was you were doing before and your hair should go back to normal over time.

Also moisture comes from water rather than conditioner (conditioner has moisturizing properties obviously but it's main purpose is to improve manageability and softness, not necessarily moisturizer) so you'd probably be better off making sure you focus on saturating your hair with water a few times a week. "
chocolatecakelumps,b74ckf,"The order you do is fine, in my opinion. If you want to include gel I would do leave in, cream, gel, then oil scalp.

all my life my hair wouldn’t grow past my shoulders but since high school i’ve been taking care of my hair better, get to know it etc. i realised my hair type is 3b and that it shrinks like no tomorrow (straight it reaches mid back, air dried it reached my collarbones) but i stretch it with my blow drier whenever i wash it (reaches bra strap). the length of my hair has been the same all over so i wanted a change, but not so drastic that it would make me regret ever touching it. 

do curtain bangs work on natural hair? i can’t seem to find tutorials on youtube so i’m asking here. what’s your opinion on them? thank you in advance :) x&&&hi thank you for your reply. i don’t understand the last part of your comment :( also the area where i live (in france) has literally no ethnic shops or salons and past experiences have made me lose trust in anyone other than myself when it comes to my hair 😭. i did cut the front pieces when my hair was dry and stretched (as i wear every day) and it turned out pretty okay , thank god!

You’re basically going to need the bang area to be no shorter than 6 inches.

You sound like you have my hair growing out of your head and 6 inches yields a bang to my eyebrows if not moisturized and stretched."
BigBlackGothBitch,b66cf7,"Your hair is beautiful, you look so handsome. But anyways I just wanna reiterate what the others are saying, you’re shampooing too much. Once a week, maybe every two  weeks (more often if you sweat a lot obviously). Every two or three days, “wash” with just conditioner. Always use leave ins or moisturizers"
cstew1990,b66cf7,"Proper hair up keep.&&&I'm trying to make sure I'm properly taking care of hair and figure out how to stimulate growth. I used to shampoo and condition daily until I learned how bad it was for my hair. I think I have 3C hair, but I'm not sure. I try to shampoo 3 times a week and co diction daily with shea  moisture jamaican black castor oil(just chose one) with the leave in Conditioner. Is this enough? Is this a good routine.

SeaSalterShaker,b6048s,"I'm transitioning right now. I wanted to do a big chop, but every hair stylist I know (as well as my female relatives) either think I'm too young to cut my hair so short or that I want to look like a boy. They know they can't persuade me to continue getting relaxers considering how messed up my crown is (and many of them are natural), but it always feels like a struggle with them. I may try to find a new stylist, but she helped one of my friends transition five years ago, so I haven't really decided yet."
WillowLei,b6048s,"I stopped going to my hair stylist & started going to one that specializes in curly hair. Stopping heat damage (flat ironing & blow-outs) & deep conditioning weekly is key. Products like Cantu, Shea Moisture, Devacurl & Eden are worth trying out!"
ateeightate,b6048s,I told them I was going natural. No resistance; I wonder why they would resist unless they didn't like working on natural hair? 
crispyturkey91,b6048s,"Transitioning from relaxed to natural curls&&&Helloooo,

So I’ve been sort of thinking here and there about transitioning from relaxed to natural curls. I’ve been getting my hair relaxed since I was like in 6th grade. So about 16 years now. 

How did you deal with your hair stylists? What did you tell them? Did you get resistance when you did? &&&I think she’s very pro-straight/pro-relaxer. Also probably the whole losing a profit. I’ve been a solid client every month for years. I also wanted to go natural in the past and basically reversed my decision within like a couple months lol I was immature and not ready at all. I think it’s a mix of all of that. &&&Did you sever ties then or they helped you go natural?"
foxxa121,b6048s,"Not sure how comfortable you are with doing your own hair, researching and finding the best routines and products for you.  BUT I would say, without a doubt do not give your money to any providing you a service that doesn’t respect your choices. May be time for a new stylist!!!&&&Your body, your choice. I have cut and worn my hair in a million different styles since I was 16-17 years old. And yes older relatives had something to say, def. a generational thing. If you are curious and want to make the change, go for it!!! My motto is ‘it’s only hair’ and YES it will grow back.. 🙂"
the_heaviest_feather,b6048s,"I can understand the resistance but maybe if you tell her you’re still going to see her for trims or a deep condition it might help? I also ended up doing more protective styles, such as braids and weaves, which my current stylist also does. If yours doesn’t than finding a new stylist might be best. "
