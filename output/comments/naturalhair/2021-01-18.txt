Daisychick_196,l49rtr,"December 28 - January 17 Hair Growth 🌳&&&&&&I recently started using rice water as a deep conditioner and I really think it helps&&&Thank youu ❤️&&&I use “Aussie 3 minute miracle moist” and then mix it in with the rice water . But as we speak, I’m pre-pooing with rice water so either way is good. Also heyy, that’s actually a pretty cool shape thank you for noticing that😄&&&I wish you well on your hair journey!&&&Sounds like a plan !"
Draw_Express,l49rtr,Any Tips on how to grow your hair faster?
Monasgma,l49rtr,Amazing! Which deep conditioner? If I may ask. Then... do you see how your hair grows? Like butterfly 🦋 wings.&&&No worries. I’ve heard about Aussie but never tried it. Rice water... heard about that too but something else I haven’t tried. I’ll let y’all know.
Wowzaitstorii,l49rtr,Awesome progress!
Zoieja,l49rtr,Looks great! I'm on my own journey along with you.

corysilk,l45vp2,Kinky curly collection!
LadyTK,l4340x,"Canvas Beauty Brand&&&Some of my previous comments on this sub, I have recommended this hair line to try. However, they are having so many issues with shipping that it isn’t worth it anymore. I bought an item on Dec 30 and still haven’t received it. Their mailbox is full so my email won’t go through. Their Instagram’s comment section is now limited because they are tired of people complaining about missing items. Yet, they are constantly promoting these huge deals on items without being open about their shipping issues. Granted it’s because their items go through USPS but they been having these issues for a year. So the fact they haven’t changed carriers after these issues and hundreds of complaints speaks a lot.

So if you come across one of my old comments about using them then I say ignore it if you want your items to arrive in a decent amount of time."

MissBeeMe,l3w13z,THIS look is beautiful on you 💯
NelliBerri,l3w13z,You're gorgeous and you have beautiful eyes! The short hair really suits you!
PoeticAngelo,l3w13z,I plan to shave mine when I'm older. Any advice? How did it feel? I am really scared that I might regret it because I have long relaxed hair and I may end up looking so ugly :(
Typicalnana,l3w13z,Your eyebrows look so cute
aclusterlove,l3w13z,So beautiful 😻
blackgirlwithagarden,l3w13z,"I’m not OP, but I shaved my head back in July 2020. I wasn’t really scared at all, but I have cut my hair before. I think now is the perfect time to do it since we go outside less and you’ll have a reasonably good sized twa when summer comes. My hair is grown a lot already so I’m glad I did it when I did. If you’re young now you’ll have long and healthy hair by the time you get older, so I’d even suggest doing it sooner. Hope this helps!"
cosmicstar91,l3w13z,"I shaved my hair back in November 2020. I'm loving the growth so far 🌱🌱🌱&&&&&&Thank you!!!&&&Thank you!&&&Hi! 👋🏾&&&When I am not going for a full on beat. I make sure my eyebrows are looking decent and I put on light concealer and mascara. The decision is up to you girl, I think you will look fine :)&&&It felt AMAZING to go on and cut my hair. On the real, I mostly wear caps when I go out but sometimes I do wear my hair in public.&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you! Yeah I'm really excited 💗&&&Thank you! 😊&&&Thank you 😀"
subway_eatflesh,l3w13z,You're stunning!
sugary_sweetp,l3w13z,I love this soft beat! Enjoy the journey! 🖤
BlackThatsAll,l3vkyv,"The hair style in the image is just twists. Shampoo, condition (lather the conditioner on the strands well and leave on for at least 5 minutes), and detangle your hair. Then use your favorite gel or wrap foam to twist your hair. BTW, kinky tight hair is one of the best hair types to hold a style - of course your 4c hair can do this and more! 

You can follow your favorite tutorial on youtube. Many of the tutorials also show how to unravel the twists, which is called a ""twist out"", but you can just skip that. Here's an example:

https://youtu.be/rA4QU4ibhws"
Worstmodonreddit,l3vkyv,Those are just 2 strand twists. They look this thick and juicy on 4c hair.
WorthyLocks,l3vkyv,"That just looks like a twist-out to me (kinda blurry, though).  So I'd say however long until you can hold sections to get it to twist.

while wet put in a good leave in make sure the section is detangled, add in a gel or pomade-something for hold, and twist it up.  Let it dry COMPLETELY while twisted then you can untwist and even divide each half into smaller sections if you want.  You should be able to find more detail on youtube."
freakofcolour,l3vkyv,"thanks op and everyone in the replies, im defs tryin this sometime"
isaac00004,l3vkyv,"I have that thick, tough, dry ,nappy 4c hair. Can i get whatever hairstyle this is called? If so how long does my hair need to be?&&&&&&yay. I’ll be sure to try them&&&thank you very much i’ll check her out !&&&thanks 🙏🏿&&&ok thanks 🙏🏿&&&thank you i’ll check out the video&&&thx happy cake day too"
kesanetx,l3vkyv,"You should get these once your hair stretches past your eyebrow, or else it will be too short and look dumb when they shrink."
ropafadzoreally,l3vkyv,"These look like twists, which you can absolutely achieve with your hair. Look up JennJ on YouTube, I think she has a tutorial"
subway_eatflesh,l3vkyv,"Yes, you should use longaid curl activator. Super old school and super moisturizing. I honestly say 2 inches is a good length."
AbigailzRobinson,l3u9oj,How I straighten my natural hair with no heat damage!&&&
Cocoadoll,l3nswi,How have you been retaining length? Any tips? Your hair is beautiful!!!
IbrahimRahim12,l3nswi,What prompted the chop?
mellabarbarella,l3nswi,"April will mark 9 years since the big chop!&&&&&&Girl, there are plenty of times when I’m doing my hair now and I want to chop it all over again, but that’s how much I disliked hair that short on me 😅 especially when my arms get tired from fussing with it too much!&&&I had a mohawk and wanted to go natural, on top of a couple personal things, so I went for it!

I should say I have nothing against a frohawk, but my hair’s texture previously would have made it really difficult for me to feel confident.&&&Thank you!

I really didn’t focus on retention up until about 2018. But I started leaving it alone and keeping my hair in a protective style or covered as often as I could. 

I stopped washing every few days, and if I feel compelled to wash, I do a co-wash/rinse with conditioner between wash days. I also got a really good detangler (Aunt Jackie’s knot on My Watch) and started detangling before I wash, rather than  doing it in the shower where I get tired. It was bananas how much less breakage I had. Adding in a weekly pre-poo or hot oil treatment and a deep conditioner also helped. Oh yeah, and I don’t use any plastic combs anymore - I use the k-cutter comb (wide metal teeth) to detangle and that was the first step to getting my hair to my shoulders. I’ve never tried a denman brush, but I don’t trust it for some reason.

My go-to protective style was a parted two-strand twist cornrow that I’d keep in for a week. Recently, I figured out how to do knotless senegalese twists, so I’ve been rocking those."
