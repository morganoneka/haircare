Wowzaitstorii,kq0c6x,"I like using shea moisture it‚Äôs pretty cheap.
also if you haven‚Äôt been doing it already, i would look into pre-pooing with oil. Doing that before i wash my hair makes it super moistured"
blackgirlwithagarden,kq0c6x,"Shampoos that aren‚Äôt super drying?&&&Hi! Could y‚Äôall recommend your favourite shampoos that don‚Äôt dry your hair out a lot. 

I have type 4, medium density, and low porosity hair.&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you!"
blissful214,kq0c6x,"I like to use the head and shoulders royal oils shampoo. I have thick type 4 hair and that really cleans my hair and scalp without being really drying, and it has a lot of slip as well. It's also pretty cheap too."
pastelie_ghostie,kq0c6x,"The cactus rose water shampoo by carols daughter is good. On the website they have it under the type 3 category but I have type 4 hair and it works very well. Has a decent amount of slip too, so I can detangle a bit with shampoo in, and the smell is very nice. Im always changing shampoos, but this one I feel like i won't ever change"
KindResist0,kpzobt,Lazy Natural Guide??&&&Hey friends. Any lazy low porosity naturals out there? My hairs been the same length for three years and I‚Äôve noticed it breaks off at what I believe are the ends. Any advice? I can‚Äôt dedicate as much time into a routine as I‚Äôd wish cause ya girl got a 45min drive to&from work everyday + school and it‚Äôs that thick arm hurting hair. I typically like protective styles but those seem to not be working for its overall health :/

I have only gone through a few of the See Some Curls videos, but I have already learned so much! I highly recommend purchasing access. The free version of Wash Hour E-Guide has some overlap with See Some Curls, so if you're not interested in paying $35 that's a good option. Thank you so much for making this resource guide!"
Kcvexo,kpue3h,Im glad they are able to help so many but they are extremely condescending.

mamiafro,kpue3h,"hi i have alopecia and genetically my hair tends to easily thin, what helped me a lot was biotin, castor oil, and collagen, I use NOVEX (a brazilian brand) and Ludwig & Weinstein. Also, flaxseed. FLAXSEED FOR LIFE, I use it on hair blisters.  


also depression, any type of anticonceptive methods, stress and low levels of iron contributes to hair to thin out. Im not a professional hairstylist, this is my experience  


im sorry if my english sucks, im from venezuela."

ohemaa18,kpue3h,"Need hair help? Here‚Äôs a resource list&&&
Here‚Äôs a list of resources if you need help with or have questions about your hair.

*Edit: I'll be periodically updating with new events and updates! (Updated 3/2022)*

In September, I started following the advice of hair professionals and I‚Äôve really been enjoying my hair so much more. My regimen is simpler and I‚Äôm not experiencing the tangling that I always had to deal with (for reference, I have tightly coiled or type 4 hair). So I wanted to gather some resources for anyone who is trying to have a better relationship with their hair. One of the fundamental issues with natural hair is that a lot of the information that gets circled around comes from YouTube or influencers who share hair tips based on what works on their own head or what they‚Äôve learned from another Youtuber or influencer. Because of that, we get methods or practices that become staples regardless of whether or not they‚Äôre actually good for our hair. 

Getting information from licensed stylists who have studied hair and worked with so many different hair types is super helpful because they can speak to what works for your hair based on science and professional experience. Some of the resources aren‚Äôt free but I like to think that the money you spend on a consultation or a digital guide will save you money in the long run when you‚Äôre not buying products that don‚Äôt help your hair. The list is by no means exhaustive, it‚Äôs just has the resources I‚Äôve come across. And, as a disclaimer, I do not personally know nor am I affiliated with anyone included here. 




#**Finding a curl specialist**
Booking an educational salon session with a professional allows you to learn in real time while they style your hair. To help in your search for a professional, you can use [this directory](http://www.blackcurlmagic.com/stylist-directory/) which lists professionals by state. The stylists in this directory have completed the Cut It Kinky training course and can work with all textures of hair including tight curls or kinky hair.  I found my stylist on here! You can also try searching on Instagram using tags like #curlyspecialist, #curlyhair(your city), #curlstylist etc




#**Virtual Consultations**
Many stylists offer virtual consultations to discuss your hair one-on-one. This is a good option if you‚Äôre not yet ready to do the salon process but want to learn about hair options. It‚Äôs a good place to start exploring. During consultations you‚Äôll go over your current regimen, hair goals, techniques, and proper hair care. (You can book from anywhere but I included physical locations too if you‚Äôre interested in booking an in-person appointment) 


* [Consultation w/ Jessica Kiyomi ](https://app.squarespacescheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=20592224): Oakland CA, Currently open ($75)

They are a newer company so there aren't too many reviews and I can't speak to their knowledge about tighter curls, but a  fellow Redditor utilized their services and found it helpful. Prices are listed by the Australian Dollar and British Pound for reference but they take international payment (GBP 60 for full consultation, GBP 30 for a followup)

* [Consultation w/ The Digital Loctician](https://digitalloctician.com/schedule-an-appointment/virtual-consultation/): FOR LOC CARE ONLY. After the consultation you will be given access to the recording of the call and a detailed, written hair care regimen. Currently open ($147)

Tickets available [here](https://yesherstudio.as.me/schedule.php?template=class) ($50)




#**Social Media**
Finally, many stylists share free information through Twitter or Instagram. Tweets explaining the science behind why using oils can prevent hydration is what started this hair rediscovery for me. For twitter, I recommend searching through accounts with keywords like ‚Äútexture‚Äù, ‚Äúconditioner‚Äù, ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù to find relevant tweets. Many stylists have hosted Twitter Spaces and saved the recordings for people to watch later. Instagram is great for videos, saved live Q&amp;As, or reference pics for styles/haircuts. As a reminder, even though stylists share general information, they can‚Äôt accurately give you personalized advice to everyone without knowing your hair characteristics so asking them specific questions like ‚Äúwhich shampoo is best for my hair‚Äù will usually be answered by them asking you to book a consultation. 

* Anita (@monarchcurl) has compiled a table of contents of her [Twitter threads](https://twitter.com/monarchcurl/status/1390095304221892612?s=21)  regarding hair care. This is a good place to start for basic understanding around relearning your hair. This [other Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lifewithami_/status/1366393880921440256?s=20) also does a good job listing a bunch of helpful tweets from many of the other stylists listed below.

If you prefer learning from YouTube, there are some professionals who make content (just not as much since YouTube can be a whole job itself). You can check out the 4c Hair Series from The Doux or the Curls Disrupted Videocast on Black Girl Curls YouTube page. Curls Disrupted is also available as a [podcast](https://www.blackcurlmagic.com/curls-disrupted-podcast/) if you prefer just listening.

I hope this is helpful!&&&Thank you! But the lack of upvotes is partially due to a posting problem. When I first made it, the post had YouTube links so the auto mod blocked it from being posted. A mod eventually approved it but it had been nearly a month later so not many people have seen it. It was pinned for a little bit but now it‚Äôs not anymore so I‚Äôm trying to see if it can be pinned again so people can have access to it&&&I can see how it can seem that way but I think it might help to look at it from their perspective. There tends to be a lot of tone policing that happens with Black stylists (and also estheticians) on social media. Part of it is because the stylists very often speak matter-of-factly when answering questions and another part is because written words can often seem rude without hearing them spoken. For example, a person asked an esthetician a question that was out of their speciality and her simple response, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a cosmetologist‚Äù, was seen as sassy. 

As one stylist said, they‚Äôre not Internet influencers, they‚Äôre professionals sharing information so they‚Äôre not couching that information in the super nice, high energy sort of way we expect from someone like a Youtuber. Other stylists have directly said that they don‚Äôt care whether someone doesn‚Äôt like how they speak; their goal is to share better hair habits. Those people who can‚Äôt look past their tone may not engage with them but the information and content is there for the people who seek it. And for me, who works in an environment where my matter of fact emails or direct responses are often misconstrued as rude, I can understand why they may not be super concerned about seeming nice. I very actively have to choose wording to sound as unaggressive as possible and it can be pretty tiring worrying about how you‚Äôll be perceived by others especially when you just want to talk like you normally do. 

All that to say, I can see how some of them may come across that way but the condescension isn‚Äôt really intentional and how information is delivered doesn‚Äôt change the content of the information.&&&I‚Äôm so glad it helped!&&&I would suggest saturating your hair with conditioner and using a detangling brush like the Felicia Leatherwood brush, a tangle teezer, or a wet brush. Start at the ends of the hair and work your way up to the root. If you still can‚Äôt get it out, then you probably want to see if you can find a local stylist who may be able to help. Good luck!&&&Are you asking about a particular stylist on the list? Or are you asking if anyone has found a stylist using the directory ?&&&I think your posts keep getting taken down because asking about relaxers is considered off topic for this sub so it‚Äôs against the rules. You would probably fare better if you ask in r/blackhair or r/blackladies where some people may have experience with that and can help you&&&There‚Äôs not a way to increase the density of your hair past it‚Äôs normal level so if it‚Äôs decreasing past your normal level and your doctor prescribed something, then it‚Äôs probably best to take it. Maybe get the second opinion from a dermatologist if you‚Äôre unsure. Asking Reddit can be helpful but remember professionals are trained in this area!&&&They‚Äôre currently making edits to the book and going to release a 2nd edition so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs temporarily unavailable. I‚Äôll update the post so people know"
sleepingbooty43,kpue3h,"This is a long shot, but has anyone had any personal experience with the above listed stylist in the directory?!"
slimtravels,kpue3h,Is there a name for the technique? I‚Äôd like to do more research but all I see if people talking about putting a ton of product and oils in natural hair.
tawnie6879,kpue3h,What's the best products to get out matted hair? I've been severely depressed and I let my hair get so bad. I've been using carols daughter which has helped me get a good amount done. However there is still a big section that is really hard to undo. I would cut it all off but I feel I look terrible with short hair. I'm mixed FYI.
the_jerin,kpue3h,So I have been losing my hair thickness and the scalps are kinda visible now . The doctor prescribed an anti dandruff shampoo and minoxidi ( which I have to use for my lifetime . I'm just 21 should o go ahead with minoxidil or is there any other way to still keep my hair ( increase its thickness). #help hear the plea of an amateur
zeebabe22,kpue3h,This is the best most extensive guide I have every seen and yet people have not upvoted this. It sucks everyone rather listen to genetically lucky naturals then take sims advice and fix their hair issues
Classic-Travel-7327,kprhdp,"Stylist told me that it would naturally start to blend but I have harsh separation between two colors. Spent a lot of money for this so now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs in, how can I ombr√© wrap locs once already installed?&&&"

And no heat, and as little sulfates/silicones as possible :)&&&2015! Long but so worth it. My shit was really damaged.

Then one day the length curls were like WASSUP DID YOU MISS ME?!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you! It wasn‚Äôt a BIG BIG chop, but I cut it to right above my shoulders, which was a lot.

Dandie24,kpf3pb,I think it‚Äôs 4b
Muted-Mention,kpf3pb,4a
arincer,kpf3pb,By the third pic I‚Äôd say a possible 4b? Is your hair picked out in the other photos?
No-Mark2304,kpdn7r,"I am going to second olaplex, there are a few different types of damage, physical, environmental, chemical, and it looks like you already know what caused the damage so that eliminates half the problem. Now what's needed is just the treatment, although the hair may never get back to 100% once dyed it can get really close. 

Olaplex offers a wide range of products, and the n3 treatment is very popular for a reason, I googled olaplex and found this article about it: [https://ezhairclinic.com/how-to-improve-damaged-hair-one-simple-product/](https://ezhairclinic.com/how-to-improve-damaged-hair-one-simple-product/)"
jadeelizabethh,kpdn7r,"Products for damaged hair :(&&&Hey guys a few months back I dyed my hair with box dye & now half the side of my curls are fine but the other side of my hair the curls are a little fried , do YIU guys have any products or hair masks that you use for damaged curls ?"
Dndjdnnd,kpd0eh,Strands of hair staying frizzy and not curling&&&Hi. After deep conditioning my hair and using leave in conditioner(more than enough) there are still frizzy strands of hair in my head that will not curl. What is the problem?
Common_Babe,kpb5y2,"I did mine on my own.. I had already had my end bleached with 30 vol developer and powder bleach. Then four months later, I dyed my roots with creme of nature box dye(honey blonde).. I used adore semi permanente air dye. Try using paprika/crimson/paprika. More red then orange"
EEOA,kpb5y2,Unpopular opinion but you can have bleached healthy hair if you do it right. I recently bleached mine at home with the help of my sister. My biggest recommendation is doing it in steps. Don‚Äôt use box dye. Get proper bleach 20 dev should be enough. Lighten to a brown. A few months later (doing deep treatments and proper hair care in between - I literally dc-ed every 3 days) lift again to a lighter colour. Then go on it with a SEMI permanent orange dye. That‚Äôs the process I did and my 4A/4B hair is thriving
JorjorBinks1221,kpb5y2,Honey even with olaplex your hair will be fried to hell and red/orange fades pretty damn quick. Trust me and everyone else when we say: Get the wig.
Ndanatsei,kpb5y2,I‚Äôm voting for the wig tooüôà
SnooCheesecakes93,kpb5y2,Wig...you'd have to bleach the crap out of your hair to get this vibrant a color
hoegetsyeeted,kpb5y2,What do you guys think would be the best process to achieve a color like this? only did a box dye once about a year ago.&&&
sqwzmahmeatybts,kpb5y2,"I agree with the wig suggestion. 

Otherwise, I was able to achieve the color, DEFINITELY not the style via a licensed hairstylist/colorist. We worked together on expectations and goals did it in 2 stages."
