BigRivr,dhiiko,"This is my stretched natural pattern, I can't figure out my hair type not quite 3c or 4c&&&"
PigmentedLady,dhiiko,"Definitely not a 4c. 

4b would be your curl type. You should let us see the end too. If its lose it's a if its curly its b if its coily its c"
curlsandcode,dhiiko,I think you might be 4a!
haireveryshare,dhiiko, ‘4b’ish I would say!
CoffeeB4Talkie,dhi0n9,"I'm lazy. I throw a cap on, put my hair turban towel over that. Sometimes I'll put a bonnet on over that and let my body heat do the rest. lol"
lace-space,dhi0n9,"How to add heat while deep conditioning without a steamer or hooded dryer.&&&This method is from a curlynikki post I read a few years ago, but I thought I'd share it here since it works so well! ([article](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/08/how-to-steam-natural-hair-without.html)) I've been doing this for a while to enhance my deep conditioners. This is an easy way to add heat to deep conditioning without a steamer or hooded dryer. What you need is 2 plastic caps or bags, a washcloth, hot water, and a t-shirt or towel.

1. Apply deep conditioner to hair.
2. Put on the first plastic cap.
3. Then run a washcloth under very hot water, as hot as you can handle. Then carefully ring out excess water(It will be very hot don't burn yourself!).
4. Place the hot washcloth on top of your first plastic cap.
5. Put on second plastic over the washcloth
6. Optional: Wrap t-shirt, towel, or deep conditioning cap around your head to further trap in heat. 

The heat and steam from the hot washcloth will get trapped in between the two plastic caps. This allows the hair to absorb more moisture!"
CoffeeB4Talkie,dhfpeg,"Beautiful.

I've never tried Melanin products before. Haven't tried Wetline either....."
Rae_T,dhfpeg,I really love how my wash and gos turn out . Only problem is wetline gel mixed with melanin twist elongating butter causes flakes 🙄&&&
curlsandcode,dhfpeg,Do you use the melanin twist butter for moisture or definition? I’ve been thinking about trying it but I’m a little hesitant about how well it moisturizes
visolana7,dhfpeg,Super cute
lowkeyrebel,dhfhsl,I really love how striking this photo is&&&

granolamola2,dhbory,"Love when my hair is a few days old and gets super fluffy&&&&&&You’re so sweet 😭😭😭&&&Thank you 🥰
I use oyin handmade’s burnt sugar pomade + the doux’s mousse def for my twist outs!&&&Thank you!! I put my hair routine in the thread and as far as my skin, tbh genetics helps a lot lol but I definitely think vitamin c has helped with glow a lot!&&&Thank you 😊💛
I use both depending on how my hair is, so if it’s twisted I use a bonnet but if it’s out, I use a scarf 
And I am obsessed with picking my hair out lol&&&Thank you! 

I wash my hair weekly (or try to lol). I deep condition (using a heat cap) first with a mixture of coconut oil, Trader Joe’s tea tree tingle conditioner and the mielle organics babassu and mint deep conditioner. 

Then I follow with mielle organics exfoliating shampoo. 
My leave in is the oyin handmade hair dew and I do my twist outs with the oyin handmade burnt sugar pomade and the doux mousse def&&&I am!! One day I’ll be consistent 😂"

yourbestbudz,dhbory,Yes that few days old hair hit differently.
PigmentedLady,dh6f05,Ooo sound like new growth that's trying to grow. I'd let them be and keep it moisturized at the root. Those sound very fragile.&&&Trim it off.
brainsweeties,dh6f05,Maybe try mousse?
cmon_sun,dh6f05,Is your hair very short?
lokisaddiction,dh6f05,"Natural hair popping out of box braids&&&Hey guys, I’ve had box braids in for a week and they’re already super fuzzy and my natural hair is popping out of the base of the braids. I’m putting a cap on them at night and use braid sheen on the extension part of them in the evening before I put a cap on. What can I do to

meshameesh,dh2gqh,A high top fade.
itz_stitch,dgr4u5,"Straight parts in 4c hair&&&So my hair for the most part is curly but, the hair towards my crown area is extremely straight and also in the back of my head. Anybody have any idea and why and how I can fix this. I would like to have a full head of curls"
faerykid,dgl701,"My advice is basically to keep practicing A LOT and mirrors are your friend! Have multiple mirrors so you can see around your head easily to part it and use something pointy to part, like a rat tail comb. Also make sure your hair is very detangled first because it's super hard to part well on tangled hair!

I've never tried this before, but another idea is to measure the dimensions of your hairline and according to those, figure out how many rows and parts you need in advance.

Hope that helps!"
nocautiontaken,dgl701,"How do I part my hair and not rip it out in anger?&&&I had locs for a year about 2 years ago now. I took them out bcs the person who installed them had NO idea how to properly part my hair (which doesn’t make sense bcs she had been doing my box braids perfectly fine before!). It was like I had thick locs in the middle of my head, thin on the front, and whatever the fuck the back was. It looked okay, but I was bothered by it. 

I keep doing my hair in mini twists expecting for me to restart my loc journey but like...I just can’t get the parting correct.  I always make some too big in the back and end up with not enough hair in the front to have equal sizing. Or I end up with too small in the back and too big in the front. I was fine with incorrect parting when I just wore mini twists for a casual/short term styles bcs like it wasn’t gonna last forever, but I know that if I wanna have locs again, I want that parting straight with equal sizing.

So, do y’all have any tips on equal parting at all, the square kind of partig specifically? I kinda want them to be medium sized, (similar to @prettyeyesbriii on insta) sorta like my locs before but more uniform. Should I just give up and pay someone to part for me?

TLDR: tell me how to part my hair properly before i rip my hair out from frustration"
SoloRouge,dgkt8t,"I'm at a loss&&&Hello all you curly girls and guys. I'm currently at a loss. I've(25m) been natural all my life with my mother doing a  good job caring for my thick hair up until about 2011 give or take. Around that time I began trying to take care of it but ultimately ended up neglecting my hair til about 2017 when I learned proper methods.

Fast forward to 2019 and I got my first hair trim in ages back in February and then tried to continue to take care of while keep it hydrated(Hair butters, leave in conditioners, deep conditioners and shampoo without SLS and such). I also learned about protective styling instead of constantly having my hair out. I braided up my hair for the first time in a while for a week and when I went to pull it out and comb out my hair while it was wet before I actually began to shampoo I lost about roughly this much hair, of which seems to be on par with it I just left it out instead.. Am I doing something wrong? I'm lost as to what I'm supposed to be doing and I'd hate to have to chop off everything.

(Hair lost during comb out linked here)&&&So I've heard but given how much hair I got it'd be difficult to comb out while dry. What do you suggest as a detangling product?&&&I've been worried crazy about this lately and that's why I had stopped protective styling for a while as I saw no real  immediate benefits. But I thank you for the information!"
WhildChild,dgkt8t,"Don’t be too worried, that doesn’t look bad to me. However, I pretty much only comb my hair out when it has just been washed, conditioned, & has a sufficient amount of water & product. The only time I comb my hair dry is when it has been straightened or blow dried."
Zaylyn5355,dgkt8t,Well we lose 150-200 strands a day so multiply that by 7 days&&&Also maybe comb hair while damp with some detangling product vs soaking wet. Hair is at its weakest when soaking wet
Brinaken,dgia50,"Beautiful hair twists, keep doing that. Twists and Twists-outs are very attractive hair styles."

BlvccWidow,dgbs82,I think it’s a little too short to tell but I’d say I’m looking at the beginning of 4a coils.

itz_stitch,dgbs82,Hair type?&&&&&&If you look towards the top of my head I have patches of straight hair and it’s even worse around my crown and it’s longer by my crown. Any idea why or how I can fix that ?
GucciGirl333,dgahbp,"Hmmm.. Are you using a quality deep conditioner and leaving it on long enough? Investing in a hooded dryer (if you haven’t already) is a serious game changer for deep conditioning (At least for me it was). All I can say is what works for me. I use Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Mask with a plastic cap under the dryer for 30 minutes once a week, sometimes every 2 weeks, and the hydration is crazy. I can always tell on the weeks I missed it. Camille Rose Almond Jai Twisting Butter is the ONLY thing I’ve found that holds moisture in my hair. I know it’s made for twist outs but I usually wear ponytails. I seal it in with extra virgin olive oil. Also keeping your hair trimmed helps. Dead hair will always feel dry, crunchy, and brittle. I hope I helped!"
PuzzleMastr,dgahbp,"My hair keeps getting dry&&&Hello, I’m a male with 4c low porosity hair. I wear a bonnet to sleep shampoo and condition my hair with hot water and deep condition followed with cold water; I do this about once a week and literally by the end of the day it feels extremely dry(that’s probably an exaggeration but still) it feels relatively dry like there’s no product in there.

I don’t know what I could be doing wrong I use the LOC method and everything, the only way I’ve found to keep my hair moisturized is by putting product like curling creme or leave-in and oil everyday to every other day and I feel like this might be causing build up so I wanted to know a more efficient way or is that the only way.

Thanks for the help!! 

TLDR:My hair gets dry despite doing everything I should be doing, need helping moisturizing it besides putting products in daily if that is harmful&&&I’ve never seen any build up on my shower head, is there a chance it can still be hard water without the shower head build up appearing?&&&I use the same deep conditioner as you and as I’ve just transitioned to treating my hair the way it’s supposed to be I don’t have a hooded dryer or anything like that so I just use a shower cap or a plastic bag to trap in the heat from my body; I also leave it on for about 30-35 minutes and it does look very moisturized so I believe it might be the sealant.

Thanks for the reply :D&&&Thanks and I was always told to use cold water to seal in the deep conditioner but I guess the leave in and oil need to get in there too so thanks!! I’ll try to find a way to apply heat when conditioning as well and I’ll look into those product suggestions. Double thanks!:DD"
brokewithrichdreams,dgahbp,"use shea butter for ur daily oil and when u condition add a lil extra virgin olive oil in the mix  and leave it in for 20 min. once u feel your hair stop being over dry, stop using the shea and just go to 100% oils organic oils of your choice.  🙂🖤"
hellokimm,dgahbp,it could be the quality of your water. Hard water will make your hair dryer so it might be a good idea to invest in a water softener if that’s an issue in the area you live.
sganiexty,dgahbp,"Also, when you wash with hot water make sure it doesn't burn your scalp or anything. Not too hot!

It could be your conditoner isn't moistuzing enough. Maybe deep conditon with high heat? (15 min works me) Also, stop rinsing your hair with cold water. I think cold water closes hair cuticles too much that your leave-in will struggle absorbing into your hair.

 Though, its easier for me to tell if my hair is dry when its stretched, (maybe I'm doing something wrong but my hair gets stiff and hard when it shrinks up dry).  It could also be your leave-in isn't moistuzing and isn't actually penetrating your hair. 

Switch to the LCO method. Oil seals in moisture.

For a sealant, I started using the Blue Magic Indian Hemp Hair Grease. I can't pledge for the grease yet but for a natural alternative I would recommend cold-pressed castor oil. (Not the black kind, its heated, also I find the smell strong and its thicker)"
Maysonturner,dg9a1d,"Hey! I would love to know how you styled your hair when you first became natural. What worked for you and what didn’t? I’m extremely camera shy, I’ve started posting short videos to try and help me with that.😫 Hopefully you’ll all see some improvement!&&&"
Maysonturner,dg8agg,"How to did you start loving your natural hair?&&&Hello Hello!

I started my own online store about a year ago. My online store exclusively sells type 4 natural hair extensions to encourage people or color to wear their hair natural. I often meet people who hate their hair texture or regret going natural. I recently put a picture of 4c hair texture on my Facebook page and a disappointing comment occurred.

I obviously used natural hair extensions to start wearing my hair out more and love my natural 4b hair. What are some ways you all have overcome the battle of thinking your natural hair was unattractive?"
moulinrouge77,dg8agg,"I started taking more care of it, and realized it couldn’t look worse when it was damaged. I think once there was the natural/curly hair movement I felt more comfortable and knowing how to style and take care of my curls was a huge difference. I’ve gotten a lot of compliments from my big hair and it used to make me uncomfortable but I’ve learned to appreciate and know that people are really fascinated by it in a good way especially ones that only know the generic straight hair. The only thing I envy now about straight hair and what i love about straightening my hair every once in a while is how easy it is to manage."
