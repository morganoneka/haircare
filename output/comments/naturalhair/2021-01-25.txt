IIIThreat,l9enjc,"Well, that depends on what you mean by “healthy”. I will say, in general, conditioners meant for damaged hair tend to have a lot of protein, which - if your hair doesn’t need it - will make your hair brittle, dry, and hard. Science has shown that Black hair is already pretty protein-heavy, so I’d opt for a moisturizing conditioner over a protein-heavy one. 

Now, your hair WILL need protein treatments every once in a while, but I’d do a ton of research before applying one to your hair to make sure that the product you’re getting is for your fabric of hair, and that you’re applying it at the right time. Your hair will let you know when you need one, though."

MissD34,l8yu85,"I shampoo and deep condition weekly and alternate between shampoo and co-wash every other week. As a “treat”, I deep condition with Aphogee’s Curlific Texture Treatment once per month. I moisturize nightly with [this](https://www.princessdgifts.com/products/aloe-rose-detangling-spray) and a whipped Shea butter mixture, and jojoba oil for the perimeter of my hair, then I put two Bantu knots in my hair and cover with a satin bonnet. I style a few times per week, depending on what I’m doing. Sometimes I’ll do a wash and go, or mini twists, twist/braid out, or a low/mid/high bun or ponytail (since the Bantu knots keep my hair stretched, so my hair hangs/flows down as if it’s been blow-dried/flat-ironed)."
WorthyLocks,l8yu85,"I wash and deep condition once a week.  This is also when I detangle and the only time I use a tool in my hair other than my hands.

Between wash day, I spritz with an aloe vera/water combination and manipulate my hair while damp.  I usually just pin it up in the shower but sometimes I put on a shower cap.  It's ok if it gets a little wet.  I just don't intentionally saturate it other than once a week.

If I've straightened it for the week, I don't use the spritz as much because it'll cause reverting.  I usually just spritz the scalp a bit and massage it in and then I follow with an oil I make just to help hydrate again.

Every day I spritz, I follow it with a sealing oil because I'm low porosity and I gotta seal in what little moisture I get."
corn247,l8yu85,"You probably need to deep condition and use heat/steam to open your hair shafts. Just wetting your hair daily does not moisturize it. 

I wash my hair once a week with a clarifying shampoo. Condition it, rinse, then add deep conditioner. Use a heat cap, steamer, or sit under a hooded dryer for 20-35 minutes. The non-direct heat will literally help the moisture into your hair. Then I rinse that out and style with a leave-in and creamer. 

Over the week, I stretch it with the banding method and may use jojoba oil to add shine back after 3 days. It Frizzes if I add anything else. Once I started deep conditioning with heat every week, my hair is FINALLY gone past my shoulders after plateaus there for years. Its a game changer."
flirtandflutter,l8yu85,"I wash my hair perhaps two or three times a week. In between those washes is only a couple days, so I just wear a shower cap."
junebugg15,l8yu85,"I shampoo and style every week. If I need to restyle my hair I use a co wash instead of shampoo and restyle. When I shower I just leave my buff on that I sleep in. If I wet my hair, it will mess up my style so nothing else goes in my hair until I'm ready to restyle which for me is 4 days after shampoo. No oils, no butters."
loveyouumore,l8yu85,"Basically in between washes I just do whatever my hair “needs”. I have very thick 4b/c hair, so if I need it stretched out, I twist my hair overnight(s) and then if I’m gonna go somewhere I just take the twists out and style however. So I guess I just put it in low maintenance styles until I need to actually style it. I’d say every 2/3 days I actually wet it and use my moisturizing butter, oils, and whatever else just to keep it moisturized. And then when my scalp starts looking crusty I wash again!"
my_baby_smurf,l8yu85,"What do you do with your hair between washes?&&&Hi, I'm new here. I have a question. There is one specificity of not washing hair that I can never find information on. I suspect that it's because it's a highly personal and varied thing.   


What do you do daily between washes? Specifically, what do you do with you hair in the shower?   


If you avoid getting it wet, do you put extra product in it? do you rebraid it? just pineapple? Do you leave your hair loose for the entire time you don't wash it? If so, how do you keep it from tangling?  


I wash my hair maybe about once per month or less. Typically, however, every day when I have a shower I run the water through my hair, massage my scalp under the water, and brush it out with a detangling brush. I make sure it's good and saturated, almost like I'm washing it but no shampoo. I might put some oil in it, either when I'm still in the shower or right when I get out, then i usually put it in a bun on top of my head. It will not grow past about bra strap length when stretched. I realize it's possible this is all the length I will ever get out of my hair but, what if it's not?  


I'm starting to get the sense that most people consider this daily routine of mine ""washing"". Recently I've started trying to only do this once every few days, then put my hair in braids and not touch it until next time. I don't really like how fuzzy it gets, though, and the satin scarf doesn't really make much difference. Anyways, all this to say, I'm curious about what other people do.  


What is your between-your-hair-care-routines routine?"
BoBoKaren2019,l8xru7,Good hair salons to get my 4a/b hair straightened in Atlanta?&&&&&&Thanks!&&&Who do you request? You can dm me if you want.
sqwzmahmeatybts,l8xru7,"I go to HiTexture in Lawrencville. They do an amazing job silk pressing my 4b hair, and the prices are reasonable. 

I hope more people chime in, and that you find what you're looking for!"
Bluecraft55,l8x3j6,"One last relaxer or just big chop?&&&So today I’m going to do my hair and I’m considering either relaxing or just do the chop. I have not been taking care of my hair especially my new growth natural hair so if I relax, I’m planning on changing my commitment to my hair since I do want healthy hair in the end. It’ll sort of be like a final reset.&&&Yeah I’ll probably do this!"
IIIThreat,l8x3j6,"What’s interesting is that relaxers work by REMOVING the moisture from our hair (which is why it requires all those oils and serums to stay healthy). If you’re thinking about doing a big-chop, you should go ahead, and do that. Even if you’ve been neglecting your natural new growth it’ll be easier to begin taking care of it, than relaxing again, causing more damage to your delicate new strands (and our hair is already SO delicate). 

As far as tools, just make sure to invest in a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, a humectant (moisture-loving) gel, and leave-in conditioner, and a twisting cream/custard. Keep it simple. Oh, and a good detangling brush is a MUST, and makes detangling WAY faster (as long as you take your time)."
Interesting_Onion_44,l8x3j6,if youre already planning on doing a big chop id say go for the relaxer just one last time and then you can do the big chop after!
WorthyLocks,l8x3j6,"If you're already open to chopping, I say chop.  But it's a personal choice.  Just make an informed decision.
