SailorTexas,do2lpe,"You may end up liking your hair shorter! I had long hair all my life before I went natural. Even after going natural I rocked a huge fro that got shorter and shorter over the years. Turned out, I love short hair! I would have never guessed it when I first went natural. Be adventurous with your hair! It'll grow back and you may find new hairstyles you love! It'll be better, anyway, to cut off the relaxed ends. You can do it!"
haireveryshare,do2lpe,"You‚Äôd be surprised, if you get a cute cut, it will look better than straight ends.  You have a nice face shape and if you feel insecure bucking conventional beauty standards with shorter hair, maybe lipstick or mascara to spice up a haircut and ‚Äòlevel up‚Äô the whole visage!"
jazzylicious1993,do2lpe,Getting rid or the relaxed ends will be great but soo hard I need that length....&&&&&&It‚Äôs been short like this for a while it used to be maybe bra length and even that‚Äôs too short ... I am very sure I don‚Äôt like it short I want sza type hair haha big fluffy curls with a deep side part and a lot of length&&&I usually do some light makeup  concealer bronzer blush highlight lipgloss and some mascara ....and I put my hair in a bun it‚Äôs too frizzy and undefined for me to want to show it off it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm insecure it‚Äôs just a I want it to be right when it‚Äôs down
winicia,dnyd01,Stop breakage and shedding using the products in the video&&&
MrCleanandShady,dns03d,"Can someone give me tips on how to grow my hair over my hairline?&&&I think my hair type is 4b with some 4c in it. I'm able to define my hair, especially on wash days and my hair is past eyebrow length to the top of my nose, but my hair awkwardly stops at my hairline.

Do I need to be getting a different cut? I have a high top fade, but should I change it near my hairline?"
GreenerHere,dnquyq,"It looks amazing

Spillllll"
Hopeforabettertaco,dnquyq,Those ringlets üòç I‚Äôm so happy you were able to find a routine that works so well for you.
Mafiya7,dnquyq,Share!!
Sophs_B,dnquyq,"Oooooh, that definition ü§©"
UniquelyElle97,dnquyq,"And it‚Äôs working, girl! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
jesssmeee,dnquyq,What did you do to get it coiled like that? Shingle?
ladyabercrombie,dnquyq,"What is your hair type and porosity? What is the routine, sis?"
soyeuxbaby,dnquyq,"After a decade of being natural, I think I finally found a solid routine that works for me!&&&&&&Wow, somehow I completely forgot to mention that part in my routine. You guessed right! For more definition and coils I‚Äôll add a little bit of gel mixed with olive oil and I‚Äôll shingle or I work a Denman D6 through small sections of hair. I find it delivers very similar results on my hair.&&&3C and medium porosity, although I think I‚Äôm leaning more towards high porosity. Routine is in the replies!&&&Current routine:

I separate my hair into four sections and wash my hair with the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen, Grow & Restore Shampoo. (I would like to incorporate some kind of pre poo treatment but haven‚Äôt found any succes with the ones I‚Äôve tried yet). Then I‚Äôll deep condition with the Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Masque. I‚Äôll follow up with a leave-in (I try new ones occasionally because I haven‚Äôt found a perfect fit yet) and the Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie. Finally I‚Äôll seal everything in with an oil. üíó

Still looking for the best ways to freshen my hair up throughout the week. I‚Äôm also looking to try to incorporate more protective styles since I‚Äôd like to see some more growth. 

& please ignore the alien-like hand. Idk what I was doing lol.&&&I posted my routine in the replies"
UniquelyElle97,dnlmi9,3C?
moxo1206,dnlmi9,"What hair texture am I?&&&&&&Thanks, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I am 3c or 4a or both"
dryernoodle,dnhv9f,We have the same kind of hair!! A looser texture in the front and coils in the back!
jesssmeee,dnhv9f,Definition on 1000000&&&&&&Sorry guys! It‚Äôs homecoming weekend so it‚Äôs been a busy time for me. For this look it‚Äôs a wash n go! I used the texture ID styling cream and the wet line extreme gel! I did the racking method then shingled the front because the front tries and act like it don‚Äôt have not a lick of sense sometimes lol
silenceherr,dnhv9f,I‚Äôd love to know how as well!!!
INUKYA,dnfxe1,"please help&&&so I‚Äôve been experiencing this problem for about two months now. my hair has been thinning and breaking off like crazy. whenever I put water on my hair it feels extremely dry and brittle, and it won‚Äôt take any moisturizing products that I add. the only thing that seems to moisturize it is my AsIAm jbco deep conditioner. my leave ins, styling creams, etc. don‚Äôt work anymore. whenever I detangle I get strands of hair coming out. I tried a protein treatment and my hair felt better for about a week, but now I‚Äôm back to the same old excessive shedding/breakage. if anyone happens to know what I might be experiencing please let me know, this has been such an emotional rollercoaster. 

I would like to add that I feel like i experienced this after taking liquid biotin (I no longer do as of now) and my ends feel disgusting. could this just be a sign that I need to do a big chop? I would like to avoid that at all costs, as I‚Äôve worked so hard to grow my hair, but if it‚Äôs inevitable then...sucks to be me. 
please help"
mimimindless,dndvc9,Natural since 2011 but my hair is a bit stagnant. What to do?&&&I would like to have longer hair. Right now my hair is a bit past my shoulders. I remember reading up on something on how once your hair grows to a certain length it just stays there . I wonder if it's true. I haven't had much growth in two years.
phoebelunalove,dndvc9,"How is your diet? I am sure you will get some great suggestions on things to do but that is the first area I would think about. Are your fingernails strong and grow quickly? That is a quick sign to go by. If they are not and your hair behaves the same way, nutrition may be an issue. When I was pregnant I met with a midwife who required an interview before she decided to take you on as a client. One of the things she was looking for during the interview was how my finger nails looked."
dizzyexplorer22,dn7ajb,"I learned on YouTube! It‚Äôll get tighter and neater the more you practice, good job!"
jwash1894,dn7ajb,"I‚Äôve finally learned how to cornrow my own hair! Perseverance definitely pays off. üíú&&&&&&I know how to French braid but braiding my hair in cornrows was a bit difficult. I‚Äôm so used to braiding over instead of under, but now I‚Äôve finally gotten the hang of it!

I can‚Äôt wait to practice more and then hopefully add in extensions one day, lol."
CoffeeB4Talkie,dn30u0,"Yeah, you can't repair damaged hair. You have to cut it. Whether that's via big chop or little by little...."
mahicho,dn30u0,"Help! Hair smells like burnt tire&&&So I got my hair straightened last week and ever since then, every time I exercise,  the sweat would make my hair smell weird. I decided to wash my hair and it smelled like burnt tire and even wore than that. I had washed it more tha. 4 times and my hair still looks like it's still straitened.  I'm scared it might be damaged. Any idea what I should do to get rid of the smell as well as get my curls back?&&&Oh my God!!!!"
DragonEra_,dmyfvc,"Alopecia Areata patch - hair regrowth advice&&&I have a head full of pretty long healthy/curly hair. The last few months have been stressful and I seem to have developed a bald patch from alopecia areata about the size of a quarter. The rest of my curls are long enough to cover it so nobody notices, but what can I use to help my hair regrow in that patch asap!? ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&&&Thank you!!!"
renesha03,dmyfvc,"Hey, you can try:

1. applying Castor oil or aloe Vera gel mixed with a few drops of essential oils like peppermint, lavender and tea tree to the area

2. Applying Hibiscus tea to the area using a cotton pad. 

3. Massaging the area regularly to improve blood flow and to stimulate follicles.

You would also need to deal with the stress, drink lots of water and workout. These things also help with hair growth.
Hope this helps."
renesha03,dmteww,What products do you use? I find that I'm able to control humidity firstly by ensuring my products have no or small amounts of humectants. And also by using a product that contains sealing oils/butters as my last product.
stephjory,dmteww,"The humidity‚Äã truly makes my hair a mix of waves and curl - does anyone have a way of controlling the frizz!!!!&&&&#x200B;
