Yaagetintoit,gub5mz,Quarantine boredom has led me to try more than a dusty dry puff&&&
byyouiamundone,gub5mz,"That’s funny, quarantine has led me to only try a dusty dry puff."
dymaxion_cheesecake,gub5mz,"Same.
Well, an extremely shrunken wash and go cause I'm too lazy for twistouts right now.

But OP, your hair look hella cute!"
electricheel,gub5mz,Lololol not the dusty dry puff! I love the styles you picked! That twist into the bun is PERFECT. So clean

michalemercedes,gu55hi,Tried finger coils for the first time! It’s cool to know that you don’t have to use heat to achieve certain looks!&&&&&&Ah thanks so much!&&&Yes I did my whole head and it took about 2 hours! And thank you!&&&Thanks so much!
miniursula13,gu55hi,Pretty!
mrcdsPOTTER,gu55hi,"Yah but what I gotta do to achieve that bone structure, girl!? 😍"
plantswithoutpants,gu55hi,That looks so gorgeous!! Finger coiling is awesome but it takes ages sometimes! Did you coil your whole head? How long did it take?
unicornjizzz,gu55hi,"They came out great, and your skin looks amazing!"
yoursuperher0,gu55hi,You’re right. Some looks create heat 🔥
nomoneyissues,gu4ul2,12 effective home remedies for Dry hair and scalp | Restore Lost Shine | Natural Remedies&&&
PrTYlaDY90,gu285w,I usually use it every other day with water to refresh my curls.
Urfavorganiccheeto,gu285w,"Yes. Most natural hair is really dry, so moisturizing with water & a leave in & sealing everyday can be highly beneficial to the hair. Especially the ends of hair since they are the oldest and most fragile of the hair."
VLonetaee,gu285w,Can you apply leave in conditioner daily?&&&I have cantu shea butter leave in cream. Just bought it yesterday can this be used daily for moisture?
livelaughrun--eh,gu285w,"With caution only because you could get overly oily if you get too much on your scalp, but yeah generally speaking thats fine i think, i do it when my hair needs a little extra something."
silky_link07,gu285w,I have that too! It’s very thicc. I usually twist with it and spray it with water a few days and then retwist with the leave in.
gtsmile,gtw1lj,#mirrorchallenge I tried&&&
Officerdeathwish747,gtm1si,You have such a cute smile!
gtsmile,gtm1si,Really check me out GTSMILE&&&
ohgeezyouagain,gtm1si,You look like Pharoah's wife from The Prince of Egypt!
wakanda5everr,gtm1si,So pretty!
apersonlmao,gtm0nm,Rice water&&&Do you think black or white rice is better for hair growth. Let me know. I’ve only used white rice before but I’ve heard good things about black rice to.&&&Oh maybe you have low porosity hair. I heard a lot of people with low porosity hair didn’t see much of a difference but my hair loves rice water since it’s high porosity.&&&Yeah that’s why I wondering was it better. I think I’m going to go ahead and try it out. My hair loves rice water so I think my hair would love black rice water.&&&Yeah rice water doesn’t work that well for low porosity. I do hope you found something for your hair that works!
pinpanponko,gtm0nm,black rice is higher in protein and iron but it's not necessarily clear if that protein is more likely to ferment into the water... but in that way it could be better than white rice!
veryblessedone,gtm0nm,"I been used rice water 2x, didn’t make a diff just wasted up my time"
CoffeeB4Talkie,gthhpq,"As I Am Double Butter Cream and....
Miche Beauty Twisting butter"
healymeans,gthhpq,"I recently started using water, Camille Rose Naturals - Curl Love Moisture Milk and Almond Jai Twisting Butter...moisture for days and days. For hold, I add the brand's Curl Maker curling jelly. Another butter I hear many people rave about is The Mane Choice - Doesn't Get Much Butter Than This daily hair dressing."
lonelyants,gthhpq,Hair butter recommendations?&&&
viraldigger4488,gtdye8,DO YOU USE A HAIR MASK BEFORE OR AFTER CONDITIONER?&&&
Sophs_B,gtdrsj,I think part of the difficulty is many people just don't know.
UniqueFarm,gtdrsj,I never posted my hair here. But I don't know my hair type or porosity because I don't care. I can still manage my hair without knowing that.
elliellielle,gtdrsj,"Is there any way we can make it a standard for those posting fabulous hair results to also include their hair type/porosity in the post or comments?&&&I love this sub, it’s inspiring my (potential) natural hair transition. It is awfully frustrating how often I see posts and someone asks for hair type and I never find out :( It would really help! <3&&&I see your point, but I struggle going from hair product to hair product with mediocre results. I would just like to know if having that information would help, I mean there’s a sticky on this sub that specifically addresses the question so it’s got to be important to some."
apple-pen,gt7ach,"For oil, switch to argan oil (100% argan), and for leave-in conditioner tgin Green Tea Super Moist Leave In Conditioner."
beingfake123,gt7ach,"Hair Products Ruining Skin&&&Hi! So my hair type is **4A** and I only recently realized that I have **low porosity** hair. I use the **SheaMoisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie** and the **SheaMoisture 100% Extra Virgin Coconut Oil** frequently. Last week however, I ran out of my products and it took me a while to buy a new supply. What I did notice in the mean time is that my skin cleared up significantly. I assume because of my low porosity hair, the product is not being absorbed and is instead running down my face, causing the breakouts. From anyone with a similar hair type or experience, what product do you recommend that I switch to (either a cream, an oil, or both) that would be much easily absorbed?"
chikn_nuggit,gt7ach,Coconut and nearly all of its byproducts are comedogenic and cause buildup in the skin which leads to acne and irritation. Do your best to keep those products away from your face as much as possible. It's also possible you might have a mild allergy to coconut oil and that's just how your skin reacts from that. I suggest discontinuing use of those products and avoid using ant product with coconut in the formula.
liteskinnedbeauty,gt7ach,"I too have low porosity hair, and it (and my skin) HATED Shea Moisture coconut hibiscus gelee and anything ""coconut"" period! That gelee is so greasy that it made my forehead and upper back breakout...so I had to stop using it."
Bokunoreddit11,gt6td4,I have different curl patterns too which also give my wash n go’s Dora vibes when I do a side part. Try switching to middle parts to make it look a little more even!
SetSailToTheStreets,gt6td4,"People with multiple hair types: do you treat your whole head the same way?&&&I've always assumed my hair type I was 90% kinky/4c, but after doing the maximum hydration method for a week, it made me notice that I have looser strands/4a (nape/hairline and outer edges probably around 15-20% of my hair), 4b (everywhere else around 40-45%), and kinky/coarse/4c (crown/back of the head around 35-40%) hair on varying parts of my head. Mostly medium porosity, my crown may be low porosity. This gives my wash-n-go's a very asymmetrical shape. (Like... Dora The Explorer 🙄)

I think I might start experimenting with the idea of treating my crown differently than the rest of my hair now that I've gathered this knowledge. Does anybody you use different products on your different types of hair? Does it work for you?

Here you can see my different types of curls and coils: [(this was day 3 or 4 if the MHM 85% dry with flaxseed gel.)](https://imgur.com/a/GMh4Wuy) I'm coming up on 3 years of growth this winter. With a few trims along the way and only applying heat once per year, my hair is now slightly past collarbone length when stretched.&&&I'll have to do some experimenting. I'll definitely have to set a price limit, haha.

Right now I've just been using natural/diy stuff on my hair.&&&It's nice to know someone else has this struggle. It's probably even more frustrating with looser curls. I can't imagine!

That's a good idea about trimming! I hate the unbalanced look my hair has in a wash and go but I don't think I wear them often enough for it to make me trim. I typically wear my hair in twist outs which I'll probably continue to do for the rest of my life, ugh.&&&I hate middle parts, I have a serious 5-head. I'll try it. Maybe I'll get some ""bangs"" going on."
Thestarthatfell,gt6td4,"I have 3c hair in the middle of my hair, with 2c in the front crown area, and 3b in the nape area and I mostly treat my hair the same.  I find that twist outs are the best bc they blend everything together but with wash n gos, I find that I have to spend different amounts of time on the different textures. For instance, the 3b pops with just water but the 2c needs a whole bunch of work bc it's frizzy and wavy. 

I think that treating your hair textures differently is a really good idea but can be costly in the end, especially if you're using multiple products."
alphagina,gt6td4,"I have 3 textures in my head and I treat them all differently 😂
Barley any product in back because it’s loose like a 2 b/c 
Top gets leave on oil and gel

Middle just gets curl cream 

I also cut the back of my hair more often because it is a looser texture. I have to cut it about every two months vs the top with can go about 4-6 months. 

It’s extra but whatever my hair looks good"
Defeat_your_past,gt3c9o,"Lookin great!

My sister just bought some of that leave in, I might have to try it out."
Yellagurl78,gt3c9o,Looks amazing!
prittykittysal95,gt3c9o,Love it! 👍
purpleflowers55,gt3c9o,Nice whats your hair type?
ssjenkss,gt3c9o,"Been focusing on twist outs with all this free time I have, recently purchased tgin green tea leave in after seeing it suggested on this sub, my hair loves it :)&&&"
CoffeeB4Talkie,gt2qko,Sulfur8
candierox,gt2qko,"I also have dry hair and dandruff that I'm working through but I recommend you use shampoos or leave in conditioners with tea tree oil! My hair didn't like ANYTHING else I was giving it until I started using Head n Shoulders (tea tree oil 2 in 1) and a leave in conditioner that has tea tree oil in it! (I don't remember the name). I haven't been using it long enough but my scalp feels better and it's not as bad and flakey as it used to be.
I think moisture also helps. Be sure to be moisturizing your hair every other day or so (depending on what your hair needs). Some water and a tiny bit of leave in seems to be doing the trick for me! It's super simple.

Also do what you gotta do for your hair. If you need to wash every 3 days, so be it. Halfway through the week, swap out shampoo with a conditioner only and do a cowash. That way your hair is getting the moisture it needs and you can help alleviate some of the itchiness."
chikn_nuggit,gt2qko,"I suggest washing your hair only once a week and oiling your scalp every three days with a thick oil like any kind of black castor oil. If your dandruff persists, try the Head and Shoulders Royal Oils collection. They have several products that help with flaking and dandruff that works on natural hair."
icejjfishleftnipple,gt2qko,Try using some selsun blue shampoo:)
kaeicorn,gt2qko,Dry scalp&&&Hello everyone! Recently (In the passed 2 years) my scalp has become extremely dry. Two days after wash day I get a lot of dandruff and itching. Does this happen to anyone else and what do you do to stop it? I’ve been washing  my hair every 3 days because of this issue and I keep seeing ppl say I should only wash once every week. Should I hold off on washing even if the dandruff and itching get bad? TIA&&&Thanks for all the advice guys! I’ll try out some things and see what works for my hair :)
vengefulhart,gt2qko,"You could try doing a tea rinse after you wash and condition your hair. I'm not exactly sure which tea but there are some which help with dandruff and dry scalp best to look it up on Google. You basically brew the tea in a cup beforehand let it cool and then after you wash out your conditioner you can either pour it on your hair and scalp or apply with a spritz bottle, massage it in a bit leave it on your hair for a few minutes, rinse and then style as you usually do.

Alternatively an acv rinse can help with scalp issues, you'd do it after you rinse out your conditioner as well, apply it, massage it in a bit, leave it for a few minutes then rinse it off and style as usual."
