corysilk,m58bob,"I usually get shine from my styling products.  If i wanna be extra I spray oil sheen.  

My routine is done twice a week.

*Shampoo with redken all soft mega. 
*Condition and detangle all soft mega. 
*Section hair and rinse out conditioner. 
*Apply gel to wet sections.                            
*Dip head back in shower and shake.           
*Dry hair for 20-30min.  

I do olaplex treatment on the 1st of the month.  I blow out my hair and trim every 3 months."
jordydannys,m58bob,"Tell me your monthly 4B routine!&&&Only people with 4B hair answer please ‚ù§ What is your monthly routine? I have been natural since 2017, and I don't wear braids, extensions, or wigs and I only straighten my hair about once a year. I wear my hair out, and sometimes in two buns. I feel like my natural curl pattern doesn't show as much or isn't as consistent throughout, and I can never manage to make my hair shiny and it always looks so dull. I have a satin pillow case and bonnet that I wear every night. I wash my hair about once a week or once every two weeks. On wash day, I will use rice water to saturate my hair and section it into for, and will finger-detangle my hair. After each section is done, i will put it into bantu knots (4 total) I will leave the rice water in for about 30 minutes, then go in the shower and saturate my hair with the shower water. I wash out the rice water, and shampoo and condition each section. I use the green Love Planet & Beauty bottles. After I'm done, I have my hair in four pony tails, scrunch the water out, and let it air dry (usually takes 8-12 hours to fully dry). After wash day, every morning I want to style my hair, I have to spray my hair with warm water  and use the green love planet and beauty bottle conditioner (it says it can be used as a leave in). However, my hair is never shiny or looks as good as everybody else's, and I feel dumb for having to do that every day just to manage how I want my hair to look. Once again, please only 4B hair people comment advice."
katsqaz,m58bob,"In my opinion, it sounds like rice water too often, likely too much protein? Also are you styling your hair everyday? Try to pick 1-2 styles that can last you the whole week. Maybe do clarifying shampoo, once a month. That usually helps define my curls 

Also If current products have coconut oil your can try not using products with coconut it for a month or 2 and see if that helps

Ok now to your question, my routine is Wash day every week (usually sometime Friday-Sunday). I do this mostly in the shower and my sure I use lots of water on my hair to help detangle and keep it moisturized 

- saturate my hair with water
-separate my hair into sections with clips
- shampoo
- apply deep conditioner and detangle with Felicia Leatherwood brush and lots of water 
Protein free I use TGIN honey miracle, if I need a little protein I use uniqurl or mielle babassu
- put on plastic bag or heat cap
- I leave it 10-30 mins(depends on how dry my hair is), then rinse out
- apply leave in/styling product to each section then twist or braid that section. If it's a wash and go I just let it air dry


I leave those braids in for a couple days then take them down and wear a braid out until my next wash day.

If it's looking rough mid week, I'll either do a puff or flat twist crown to last my until wash day"

Beefair38,m4qwc4,"If possible, try to buy it when it's on sale. Target had a 20% off sale the other day on all hair products."
IIIThreat,m4qwc4,"Everything I use is at least as expensive as this, if not more. This is a REALLY good product, and you pay for quality, so keep using it. What style do you typically wear, and how much of this leave-in do you typically use when you style?"
JohnyAlv,m4qwc4,"Does anyone know any leave-in conditioners that are similar to this leave-in conditioner? It does wonders for me, but it‚Äôs so expensive T-T&&&&&&Yeah I did some research and found our why this product works so good for me, because I have low porosity and most products that are good for low porosity hair are the same price, you‚Äôre right. I use about the size of a thumb per time. So it can last me a decent while&&&Thanks for the advice, I‚Äôll look for sales!"
ThatHerbalHippyGirl,m4qwc4,You should use the ThinkDirty app. It shows ingredients and even explains what they are and how good or bad they are. I scan the barcodes right in the store. Such a time saver!
TuffTitti,m4qwc4,"um it takes alot of trial and error - I always google the top 5-6 ingredients, there are many leave-in conditioners that are similar and cheaper but may or may not work for you.  Also Curls currently has a 40% off coupon code Try40...."

BlackStarBlues,m4p9s2,"It sounds like you need to shampoo more often or clarify once a month. I have low porosity hair and adding more product on top of product can make it feel dry. As a result, I use shampoo every two weeks at least and wash my hair squeaky clean.

Once you remove all the build up on your hair, I suggest that you warm your conditioner to raise the hair cuticle and allow the moisture to penetrate. For the same reason when you do your daily moisturizing, spritz your hair with very warm water before applying the moisturizer."
IIIThreat,m4p9s2,"I have fine, thin, very low porosity strands, so I‚Äôm going to speak from experience, but mainly from what my cosmetologist has told me, and what I‚Äôve been able to read from books by licensed professionals. In general, low porosity hair needs lighter products, so spray leave-ins are usually better for our hair. If you do use a cream leave-in, I‚Äôd make sure to only use a dime-sized amount over your WHOLE head (on wet hair). 

All of the leave-ins you mentioned are REALLY great products, but you may just be using too much of it for your fabric of hair. Remember that a leave-in is just a primer for your styler, not THE styler. A lot of YouTubers we tend to follow apply way too much leave-in in their tutorials, so we tend to follow suit. I‚Äôd use less, applying a tiny amount to your whole wet head, focusing on your ends. If you use a cream, make sure to emulsify it first between your hands to help distribute the product. With leave-in, a little should go a long way. 

I‚Äôd also make sure to have a good clarifying shampoo to use when needed since low porosity hair does tend to get buildup on it very easily; it‚Äôs just the nature of the fabric of low porosity hair. After clarifying, condition with a good, quality conditioner that will bring the pH of your hair back down before you apply your leave-in. I tend to follow up my clarifier with a more moisturizing shampoo as my second shampoo, then I condition - stepping down my pH gradually - but find what works for you."
PeachBlossomBee,m4p9s2,"Persistent Leave In Conditioner Residue‚ÄîSeveral Brands&&&Hey y‚Äôall. I‚Äôve always had short hair, but I‚Äôve been growing it out (4c, Low Porosity, 5-6 in without shrinkage) for a year now, and since this winter, leave ins have always left residue.

I have tried:

Mielle Pomegranate and Honey
Kinky Curly Knot Today
Mane Choice 3-in-1 (Original Formula)
Carol‚Äôs Daughter Curl Love Hair Milk

All of these leave residue. At this point it‚Äôs ridiculous... generally I apply when my hair is wet, and usually just putting it on worked, but I guess my hair is too long now and needs sectioning? I‚Äôm very new to this natural hair stuff. Please help!&&&I‚Äôve never heard of warming the conditioner. Is rubbing it in my hands okay or do I have to microwave it or something?

When I apply it‚Äôs after I leave the shower, so my hair is well soaked and warm&&&:/ a dime sized amount doesn‚Äôt last; that‚Äôs the catch :(

What spray leave ins would you recommend? I want to try and use up what I have since I did put a lot of money into it, but I want to know for future reference. Maybe Mielle White Peony?"
IIIThreat,m4m2bc,"Any time you alter your curl pattern - twist-out, perm rods, etc. - it isn‚Äôt YOUR curl pattern. You are setting the hair from wet, to dry, which changes the bonds of the hair to keep the shape you create with the help of your styler. Once you get your hair wet, the bonds of the styler are diluted, and the hair begins to release the pattern you created, and revert back to your natural pattern.

Now, you may have some curls that LOOK like a finished twist-out, and that is just how your hair grows. I have several different curl patterns in my hair, but my back hairs are the only ones they look like my finished twist-out; in this way, the twist-out is only enhancing my curl pattern. The rest of my hair lays in s-waves, so I‚Äôm altering my natural curl pattern with a twist-out. I primary wear my hair in twist-outs, but - on the occasion I do wear wash-and-go‚Äôs - my hair always reverts back to its natural pattern. 

I can‚Äôt think of any way to permanently change your natural curl pattern outside of permanent techniques (perms, relaxers, texturizers), so wearing twist-outs shouldn‚Äôt create permanent change. I mean, I WISH they did because that would make my wash-and-go‚Äôs look BOMB all over, haha, but - alas - I‚Äôll just deal with having three different curl patterns. ü•≤"
bdwgamer,m4m2bc,"Twist Out Questions&&&I think this is an important discussion -- for me at least. Isa twist-out really altering any kind of 4C, 4B, or 4A hair? I mean for me, when I first untwist the strands it looks like a very thick but loose pattern. I always split the two thicker strands. I keep subdividing them until it looks like a natural thickness. THAT is when I achieve a pattern that truly looks like my own. Is it? I've seen so many people say twists train curls or affect the natural pattern. Does my particular method alter them? Or does this only apply to the ones who do not subdivide the two larger twists?&&&I'm not talking about when people just leave the two thick strands that look like a thicker 3C or something. I keep subdividing the strands until they look more like I just put a curl defining cream or gel in my hair."

meh3191,m4dz8w,"DC hair salons?&&&Does anyone living in the DC area have a salon that they go to? I have shoulder-length 4b/c hair, and I‚Äôve had bad luck with stylists.

I‚Äôm glad I did!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you! Grays are hard in wash-and-go‚Äôs, so I avoided them until my cosmetologist turned me on to steam treatments. It gave my hair - especially the super-low porosity grays - the hydration they needed to actually uptake water. üôåüèø Plus, my styling technique SUCKED for wash-and-go‚Äôs until she taught me better. üòÖ&&&I have. Not a huge fan, but I‚Äôm still getting my wash-and-go technique down. This last time I broke out the denman, but decided to try using my fingers instead. I got decent separation, and clumping was better, but I think that may have more to do with the fact that I‚Äôve been using steam to help my grays get, and retain moisture better. I‚Äôm going to keep practicing, though. I have my monthly cosmetology appointment on Wednesday, and she‚Äôs going to go over my technique with me.

I can‚Äôt believe I find twist-outs easier to do than wash-and-go‚Äôs! üòÖ"
LaWondertwin,m4bvno,You do a nice job on both!
TiaNix,m4bvno,"I love your twist out! What products did you use? 

In the past I was intimidated by wash n go‚Äôs due the shrinkage, plus my technique sucked back in the day. Gave it another try recently and I love it!!! I‚Äôve embraced the shrinkage, grays and all. What I‚Äôve found with wash n go is there‚Äôs less manipulation. You set and forget it for at least 3 to 5 days (pineapple(s) at night, quick fluff etc in the morning). Once your hair adapt with the right products and technique...you can push your wash days further out. 

Twist out... I had to twist my hair literally every night to keep the definition I wanted for it to look right and to minimize the tangles. Is this the case for you?

Your hair looks good in both styles - but your twist out is on another level in the pics you‚Äôve provided üòÉ"
