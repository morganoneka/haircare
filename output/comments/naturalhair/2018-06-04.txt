WannabeBadGalRiri,8q0bb0,"Learning how to cornrow?&&&So for the life of me I can‚Äôt seem to grasp cornrowing my own hair. I‚Äôve tried many YT tutorials and I understand the process, but I can‚Äôt seen to implement it. I‚Äôve been flat twisting whenever I‚Äôm protective styling with a wig/crochet hair but I really want to learn how to cornrow since it doesn‚Äôt get loose as easily like flat twist. 

So does anyone have any advice/techniques on learning how to cornrow? Should I try practicing on a wig mannequin perhaps? Please share any ideas!&&&I'm saying lol. I can do regular braids and everything else BUT cornrowing!&&&Exactly! It‚Äôs like my hands don‚Äôt understand what to do whenever I try cornrowing. I always get so frustrated and give up but I might try practicing on a wig and maybe my hands/mind won‚Äôt get confused when I try on my own head lol&&&My hair is currently in crochet so when I take it out I'm going to try larger braids (I usually start off small so that may be my problem). Thank you for the advice!&&&See that‚Äôs why I refuse to pay for someone to braid my hair. My crochet right now is a mess underneath of flat twists and the bun method but no one can tell üòÇüòÇüòÇ. I‚Äôd rather have a free mess that no one will notice than spending money for someone to braid it lol&&&Hmm I‚Äôve never attempted a Dutch braid on my natural hair...I get the basic finger patterning down as I know how to braid and grab hair when flat twisting. For some reason I can‚Äôt seem to braid and grab the hair when cornrowing straight back. I was thinking of starting off larger and doing a crown like another user recommend and then work my way to doing smaller ones straight back. "
ashmgee,8q0bb0,I‚Äôve watched so many videos and had people try and teach me but I can‚Äôt for the life of me get it down. Do you know how much money I‚Äôd save if I could?!! $1500 a year I spend on getting my daughters hair braided üò©üò© that‚Äôs a damn vacation! 
deliriousmintii,8q0bb0,"The most I could ever do was one rough french braid on my Cabbage Patch Kids as a child. I too wish I could learn how to cornrow! It's such a dexterous skill, my fingers always feel clumsy, or I need a 3rd and 4th hand to be successful. "
feelingsavoider,8q0bb0,"This is going to sound crazy, but I did my first cornrow this past weekend just by like going for it and redoing until I get better. 

I started out with like a crown braid and then perfected that and then broke it down smaller and smaller to get to straight backs. 

Not sure if that will work for you but it helped me out a lot. "
gocereal,8q0bb0,"All I want is to be able to do some straight backs on my own hair when I don't feel like wearing it loose.  I don't even need a fancy style, just some basic cornrows.  I feel like, as a Black woman, I should have this skill automatically."
yellowpeach,8q0bb0,"What specifically are you having trouble with? Are you able to do a dutch braid/cornrow pigtail but having difficulty doing the straight back, or have you not gotten the basic finger patterning down yet?"
Danielanr123,8pplg5,"I‚Äôve used that same brand of dye! I don‚Äôt really experience too much dryness, but I‚Äôm under protective styles most of the time. I deep condition a lot when I can, and cowash rather than shampoo."
HowYouDoinz,8pplg5,"4c with color?&&&I'm 4c, I already suffer from dryness, and shedding but I want highlights because I am in love with this color. How do you take care of your color?

KittyWeston,8pplg5,"So I‚Äôve bleached and dyed my natural 4c mostly (some 4b/a too) since 2014. I‚Äôve been green, blue, red, and I‚Äôm rainbow right now. 

It‚Äôs difficult when you don‚Äôt already have a routine. My hair still grows but I am terrible at maintaining it. It‚Äôs great when I actually try taking care of it tho. 

I would say have a routine already, add a little more moisture. 
Side note: I‚Äôve only used boxed dye once and it really messed to my hair. I usually use other dyes and they are harmless"
h0p3n3ss,8pplg5,"Hey there!

I‚Äôve only used boxed dyes while natural. 

I‚Äôve found the Shea Moisture dyes to be pretty good on my hair. I‚Äôm super lazy, and don‚Äôt moisturize often outside of when I‚Äôm actually washing it on my wash days biweekly. The Shea moisture dye won‚Äôt lighten your hair as it would if you were bleaching it, but for my hair, the color works REALLY well. It doesn‚Äôt leave my hair dried out, and honestly it ends up feeling a lot softer after dying, so I‚Äôd definitely suggest it. 

The only downside is that with dark hair, it won‚Äôt lighten it to be the exact color on the box. 

I‚Äôve used the bright auburn when I had a longer taper cut and I‚Äôve used the medium chestnut brown with my shorter TWA. I believe they might have a color similar to the dye in your link. I can send you pictures of my hair with the dye in it for both colors once I find some that don‚Äôt have Instagram filters on them!"
JellyYumm,8pgpas,"Crochet Dreadlocks: What does 'Hot Water Activated' mean?&&&I recently bought a couple packs of natty goddess dreadlocks loose waves and I noticed they smell pretty bad. Im guessing ""hot water activated"" either means I should boil them, which should help with the smell, or dip the ends in hot water. I'm not sure which I should be doing and I can't find the answer anywhere.&&&Here's a picture of the [dreads](http://image.samsbeauty.com/common/productimages/25690614/B_Goddess_LooseWave_detail.jpg) I purchased. "
pmunkyandpals,8pgpas,"I'm not sure about the hot water, could you post a picture of the package and dreads? 

For the smell you can do this: Soak the hair in a 1:2 mixture of apple cider vinegar and lukewarm water for 20 mins. Squeeze and rinse, then hang to dry. "

Awakeat5amagain,8pcunz,"Great advice from all the replies / also look into ceramics oils like grape-seed or sunflower oil. Prepoo with oils high in ceramides and as a finishing oil have really helped me to retain moisture. 

Prepoo with ceramide oil
PH balanced shampoo
Protein treatment 
Deep moisturizer conditioner
Leave in / SCURL is my fav
Style 
Once dry apply little more ceramide oil"
PinkPurse12,8pcunz,I use grease and water and my hair stays moisturized and shiny for daaayss.
Trp_brie,8pcunz,"How do I do my hair????&&&I‚Äôve been natural for a year now and I just can‚Äôt figure out how to retain moisture and shine

When I do my hair I apply a leave in an oil and a gel on soaking wet hair and no matter what it dries looking crusty as ever

I go the whole process again on dry hair and it sticks for only a day then the next day I have to ‚Äúreactivate‚Äù the products with water then re stretch with a blow dryer.

Someone please help me I‚Äôm tired of buying new products and watching tons of tutorials waiting for something to work."
kissed_aRoosevelt,8pcunz,"You should be getting decent results with your routine so it might be the products that you are using. Would you mind letting us know the products and also your hair type? (Not your curl pattern, but porosity, density, etc.)"
whaddupgee,8pcunz,"Not entirely sure what your whole regimen looks like but the fact that you are using a blow dryer to stretch and re-stretch your hair is a big red flag! I used to blow dry my hair a lot because I love the stretch but it caused me dryness, breakage, and increased suffering.


I've replaced my blow dryer with the Q Redew hair steamer and banding. After washing + deep conditioning I add a leave-in + coconut oil and use the steamer to help detangle and stretch, then I set my hair in banded twists. This stretches my hair out as much as the blow drier used to and does not leave it damaged and brittle. 


Would love to learn more about your hair regimen like others have mentioned here because it's hard to say what else would help you since we don't really have a good idea of everything that you do to your hair on a weekly basis."
worldCitizen17,8pcunz,"It sounds like you may have high porosity type hair (I obviously don't know for sure..but it seems that way from your post).  Have you tried using a protein/deep conditioning treatment? You won't be able to grow your hair out or have it absorb moisture properly unless it is also deep conditioned. Meaning:  regularly apply a  treatment that has both moisturizing & strengthening properties to your hair under heat (either under a thermal Hot Head cap, hooded bonnet dryer, or even a shower cap with a towel on top). Do this for \~20\-45 minutes. This helps repair hair strands so that they can absorb & retain moisture better, else it just disappears. I really like Green Beauty's ""Real Protein Treatment"" that I tried a year ago. It saved my hair from feeling like straw. Aphogee also has a protein treatment which you can find at Sally's, though I have never tried it. SheaMoisture's ""Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque"" is also really nice (I've tried this myself and still use it). 

Lastly, you may be sensitive to coconut oil ( you didn't mention what oils you used). People who are sensitive to coconut oil can often use products with it, but not just by itself. 

Anyway, hope this helps!"
Jasmina095,8orxjj,"The 4C Hair Journey&&&Hi Everyone!! For the last 7 months, I have been trying to understand the unique texture that I have been born with. I search the internet for Advised sometimes finding something helpful...Others...well no likely, why? I have been seen so many negative comments about it that I was thinking if this is actually real, It wasn't I had hoped on my hair, I ditched social Media and Started to experiment on what is safe and what is not. and that's the way I started learning that my hair is not difficult at all it just needs extra care and love and absolutely natural products to use!!! "
jayemerald16,8orxjj,Im 4C. Right now I‚Äôm loving Jamaican black castor oil 
beautylit,8ohto8,I wrap my edges then put a bonnet over it 
bishhhwahhh,8ohto8,I found the really wide band bonnets that can be worn kinda low on the head don‚Äôt hurt my edges. 
etoileleciel1,8ohto8,I use a satin pillowcase instead of a bonnet. Or you can do what my sister did and make a huge bonnet. It could be the fact that your bonnet is too small and really tight.
manicmidori,8ohto8,"Bonnet might hurting my edges- headwrap suggestions?&&&How do you guys wrap your hair at night? can you link me to any products where the band doesn't press into your edges too badly? Also, any tips on preventing breakage along my edges? "
moonbvby,8ohto8,"It depends on the hairstyle, but usually, I just tie my scarf on it. The bonnet band sitting on my hairline hurts me, too. A lot of times I'll wrap my edges to keep them in place and put my bonnet over my puff. To prevent breakage, I stopped doing all that swoopty doopty edge stuff, stopped using a brush on them, and stopped wearing things that sit on them (eg bonnet, hats, even wigs for more than a day or two at a time). I also apply castor oil to them every day."
originalsoul,8ohto8,Saran wrap after oiling your edges works!
