MissD34,qf0zde,"Yes, essential oil benefits overlap each other; you just have to pick the ones your hair likes. A few basics are grapeseed, sweet almond, avocado, olive oil, and jojoba oil. Apply to your scalp or your hair, depending on your personal needs. Everything is trial and error and you need to give your hair time to react/adjust. Some can be used for sealing in moisture, as a prepoo, or just as hair “food”. You just have to experiment and research. There’s also folks out there that say oils aren’t needed/beneficial but again, try it and listen to how your hair responds."
SaltedOreo,qf0zde,"Benefits and Use Cases for Essential/Carrier Oils&&&I’m new to using natural hair products, and I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. Can someone explain the benefits and use cases for each essential oil and carrier oil? I’ve been looking online and it seems like there’s a lot of overlap between each oil. 

Furthermore, how do you know which one to use, where to apply it, how to apply it, and when to use it?"
etherealmeadows,qesngl,Leave in conditioners aren’t necessary search jenniferrosenyc on twitter for more information
jazzy6605,qesngl,Does it matter the type of leave in conditioner I put in my hair? If so what are good leave in conditioners&&&
Bumbum2k1,qekw0w,You need to wet and detangle your hair and use some product to see the texture usually. But I wouldn’t worry too much about typing your hair. Most people have multiple curl patterns on their head.  I usually just try to find people with hair that acts like mine and follow what they do lol
Educational_Ad_333,qekw0w,Type 4

DA5TUFF,qejq3o,"Braids question&&&Hey so, I recently braided my hair after growing it out for about 2 years, and it’s finally long enough to braid. It’s sort of looks like Unknown T’s braids. However, when I sleep, it gets all bent out of shape and looks messy in the morning. What should I wear on my head before I go to sleep to prevent that from happening?  I tried wrapping a bandana on my head before sleeping, and it works but it eventually falls off in my sleep lol. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated 🙏🏾"
Raeleenah,qejq3o,"I rub in a good amount of mousse then tie on a satin scarf/durag. If i think it's not secure enough, I put on a regular scarf on top. If it isn't silk or satin, it is likely catching on little hairs and moving them out of place."
kolorsofthewind,qejq3o,Personally I put my braids in a loose low ponytail and use a long wide scarf to wrap my hair. A bandana is probably too small for the job. I would get a scarf at least large enough to do a head wrap. They also make bonnets that are big enough to hold braids that could be another option.
IndaraNaturals,qeje1q,"I’m also type 4 with a lot of hair. I apply my products in the shower on soaking wet hair and I don’t shingle. 

Twisting my sections hasn’t worked for me. I feel like my results just end up looking like a twist out. Maybe I should try making the sections bigger. 

I also don’t add any oil as I feel like it makes my hair feel dry. 

My fastest wash and go takes 30 minutes and I let it air dry. 

I only use a leave in and gel as my styling products."
blakchat,qeje1q,"A few tips I’ve picked up for WnGs&&&For context, I’ve got type 4 hair, and a lot of it. As much as I want to “embrace the frizz” and have a super easy-breezy wng, that just ain’t happening lol. 

For whatever reason, my hair does not hold its curl easily! But this last year I’ve really been working on my technique for this style. I had never been able to do it without literally using 8 oz of gel, 1k+ hours shingling, and days drying, and even then it wouldn’t last 2 days. Braid outs were just my thing.

But this year, I said it’s time. WnG are a skill, and I will master it! It helped that this was the year of the hair detox. While I didn’t do it like the people who made it up wanted you to do, I did focus more on shampooing properly, and that gels  shouldn’t be drying because they are hydrophilic. Even the cheap ones act like humectants, if they don’t contain too much alcohol!

I definitely prefer a “flat” wng (super defined, as little volume as possible). It just gets too big too soon if it’s not defined, and doesn’t last as long.

I just wanted to share with you some things I’ve learned to get a soft, defined, and moisturized wng:

-you’re hair doesn’t have to last two weeks or more. Most natural hair influencers have low porosity hair, so their main after one week looks like after 3-4 days. Sometimes I will do my hair 2x/week if it’s just too dry (I live in a desert)

-every step of your routine should be doing something. That means every product you use should make your hair softer, add some slip, add structure, etc. I don’t prepoo, takes too long, but I do use two different shampoos now. A cheaper Pantene one to get the gunk off, and a moisturizing one to start detangling. Design essentials is the first shampoo I’ve tried that makes my hair feel soft, like I used conditioner or something. Lots of other great ones out there, I just saw it on sale and decided to try it. A good shampoo is life-changing.

-if youre cleaning your strands effectively, you don’t need to deep condition every time. Let’s be honest, you’re natural oils will probably never coat your hair, so there’s no need to be afraid of shampoo stripping them. You do, however, need to remove the oils, silicones, etc that you put on it so that the hair can be rehydrated (which just means replenishing the water in the hair), and then add more oils and silicones to keep it in there for a bit lol.

-scrunch ends of hair while rinsing. My hair struggles to stay defined, so this definitely helps my wash n go’s.

-apply leave-in while hair is soaking wet. Apply a little of your styler too before hopping out of the shower to apply more.

-apply leave in and styler in sections! Keep the sections twisted, and cover sections with a plastic cap when you aren’t working on them. I clean up the shower before I finish styling in front of the mirror 

-add an oil or silicon serum on top of the gel. Focus it on the ends. Helps with moisture loss, which should help prevent breakage, fairy knots, and fairy knots in the long run. Not too sure about this, but I’m testing it out as well. Definitely makes my ends feel nice though.

-no need to shingle! Massage and rake products through hair, then twist up the sections. Cover with a plastic cap or two, then a scarf and go to sleep lol. Let the product marinate. You can probably do this in a shorter time, I just wash my hair at night because of my schedule.

-now, just dry!
Jk, this is usually the longest part. I tie a scarf over my head for at least 20 minutes to reduce fly always before removing it. In good weather or summer, I’ll just take a walk for 20-60 minutes and the ends are dry. Usually, I’ll just let it air dry, maybe diffuse the roots. Occasionally I would just blow dry, but I felt like it ruined all that work I did to get moisturized, defined hair and would feel dry and frizzy.

Lately, it’s been way colder, so I’d rather not air dry. I have been putting a scarf on my head and using the hooded dryer attachment. I’ll tie my mail down, like I’m going to sleep and focus the dryer on my roots , not even putting my ends inside for most of the time. I’ll switch around the position of the scarf and dryer every 15 minutes or so, and I’ve had great results doing this! Took 90 minutes to get 90% dry on medium heat and speed, but it feels like I air dried the last 2 days, soft and juicy lol 

So this seems like a lot, but I can wash, set angle, style, AND clean the bathroom in 90 minutes after some practice. The longest part is the overnight bit and drying, which can probably still be shortened. Still experimenting.

But yeah, what are your tips for a bomb wng? And I hope mine help anyone struggling with theirs!&&&Interesting!  I wish I could do my hair in 30 minutes 🥲 maybe I still need to work on it.

Idk what’s up with my hair, but it really doesn’t hold onto moisture that well. Keeping it in twists just keeps it from drying out too quickly. And maybe you’re right, they could be too big to really set into a twist out. I don’t try to dry it like that though, that might also help.

I only use a leave in, cheap gel, and serum (now) to style, too. Since I’m blow drying now, the serum really helps keep some moisture in my hair."
Angelinapatina,qegcij,"Girl if I did what you did, I would have hydral fatigue lol. You said you condition in the shower, and then you shampoo, and then you deep condition. So you don’t use regular conditioner again after this right?

Edit: Also cold water works if you have high porosity hair, but warm water is best for low porosity. Water temp depends on porosity."
IndaraNaturals,qegcij,Use low heat and don’t do it too often. Once a month or less.
IsabelleDruant,qegcij,"Any tips on blowing out the hair without damaging it too much?&&&&&&Ohh okay, thank you!&&&I didn’t know, thank you for telling me!&&&I’m going to check the website out. Thank you for the information!&&&Okay, thank you!!&&&Wow, thank you for the information! I’m going to try it out!! I’m also going to check the person out from ANTM."
Monasgma,qegcij,You have beautiful hair. Blow drying is quick and simple with REVAIR.  It it a bit pricey as hair dryers go but it’s worth it. It suctions hair. Check out the video on REVAIR.com. Great for our hair. Of course use heat protection.&&&Game changer.
Numerous_Algae_493,qegcij,"Blow drying shouldn’t cause major damage. Just be mindful of the heat setting & make sure you section your hair, so it’s detangled.

My hairstylist actually rips through the hair carelessly, like I’ve seen most people do. I just go for the quarterly trims."
Ok-Strawberry-8770,qegcij,"Make sure your hair is deep conditioned and moisturized first and foremost. 
Keep it braided overnight and let it dry a bit first. 
When you first start blow drying, use the tension method with cool heat. 
Then you can use a styling brush to stretch it more at a higher heat."
Other-Yogurtcloset81,qegcij,"I like the way it looks as a style. 
My sister, does a great Senegalese African Threading 🧵. Yas 👏, you can achieve a blow-out look without using heat 🔥,
using the above method also. 

I like to stretch my hair with: “Curl Formers (Spiral.)”&&&u/IsabelleDurant

⚠️ Word Wall ⚠️ 


Get your 🍿 

I never needed to blow-out my hair with heat. 
I mostly Wash (clean/no co-wash) my hair, Deep Condition. I use the “Wet” blow-dry brush for the detangling. 

I use a Detangler called Slip-and-slide, Refreshing Spray and/or  Leave-inConditioner spray from, and a very light moisturizing cream from “Soultanicals”

Add in products, detangle the clean hair. 

I would 2 strand twist my hair then, bandtu knot my hair.

I might use rubber bands to secure the hair in place.

Don on a Silk or Satin bonnet.
Let hair dry 100%


Next day I wound take my twisted down with, Pre-oiled (less friszz during take down) hands.

I also wear Nitrate gloves causes less frizz.

My hair kinda looks just like yours the next day minuses styling the hair. 

*I love 💕 the bed head look.*

I honestly don’t think it’s a texture thing.

I feel like every texture can achieve this look without heat if they want it, to it’s just a learning curve. 


I, personally don’t like heat on my hair. 

That’s a personal preference and that doesn’t mean that I haven’t put heat on my hair, 

or that I’m against others who use heat on their hair.
To each it’s own period.t

I just wanted to let you know that are “Alternatives”

Try-it out!

PS: I know Ya/Ya from ANTM. 
Would use stretching methods,to make her hair have the appearance of a blow-out.

People would always say that she was blow-drying her hair or it was a Tex-lax. 

she chimed in to say: “I know how to take care of my hair etc.”

 I just wish she would’ve explained to people how-to but it was just a flippant remark because people were being mean. Some folks just wanted to know.

I detangle in the shower with a conditioner and then I would add shampoo rinse and deep Condition. 


Please! After you rinse your hair apply 2 Tablespoons of 🍎ACV in a bottle with 4 .oz of pure water. Apply solution to hair and rinse out with warm water.  Your hair will be sooooo soft.

Also I would invest in a shower filter or a whole house water filtration system. 

I don’t know if that is feasible.

Please Do NOT use cold water on our hair texture. That’s not for us.

TegridyFarmsSalesRep,qectxs,"Keep it, the contrast looks cool. I have heard of people putting hair paint wax on their braids but it doesnt seem worth it."
dreamytealuv,qectxs,"It's kinda late now but next time go to a braider with the ability to tuck your hair. 

Adding mousse will atleast stop your dyed hair from sticking outside of your braids."
Wertyasda,qe9dx5,"Mini vent: Afro Hair shops in England - Can’t stand them.&&&I should be able to go into a hair shop &amp; leisurely BROWSE in the same way I would if I went to Zara, H&M or even Ikea..

I walk in the store, you STARE at every damn thing I do, it’s already an awkward, shitty & uncomfortable feeling.

I should be allowed to take as many photos of the styles I like so I can go back home, decide & then come back to purchase. 

You stare at me… watch me take my photos and THEN tell me ‘You can’t take photos because you may set up your own business’. 
Why didn’t you tell me at the start? 

Afro hair stores make you feel like criminals & I hate every aspect of the experience. 

You can tell the staff expect you to step in, pick up any old random item, PAY then leave. G-d forbid you stay longer than 5 minutes.., you come across as EVEN more ‘suspicious’ than your presence in the store alone was already deemed.

I would love to browse in a hair shop untill kingdom come, but even this sense of freedom is a luxury. 

To clarify: The Indian guy who said I couldn’t take photos wasn’t a bad guy, but him &amp; his colleagues constantly staring PLUS his sudden ‘rule’ & his reasonings he told me too late PLUS the repeated hostile dynamic you experience year after year in multiple Afro-hair shops across London, puts me off all together from wanting to shop. HATE IT"
privacypolicy1996,qe9dx5,I thought this was just a thing where I’m from.  The black hair stores here have the same hostile experience. You walk in and all the girls that work there stare and you and they have an attitude lol
M_Sia,qe8zfm,Knotless braids do not hurt and I when I braid my hair in plaits it doesn’t hurt. Twists with my own hair doesn’t hurt as well.
Savageho3,qe8zfm,Tension matters so how tight are you making these styles?
Timtayy69,qe8zfm,"I'm in the same boat, two strand twists with natural hair may be the solution especially if your natural hair is short enough to have it not tied up.
If you do knotless braids tie your up at the top of your head, not at the back. There's less tension as it's resting atop your head not pulling down due to gravity"
happyhippoking,qe8zfm,"I don't have any solutions, but I feel you. Protective styles give me headaches and even my own natural hair gives me headaches in a wash n go (the weight of the water and gel combined with length and density). I like doing my own twists and I don't have any problems with that."
la_1999,qe8zfm,"How can I go natural with being prone to headaches?&&&I have been relaxed all my life, and I’d like to try going natural. My natural curl pattern is most likely 4C. My biggest hurdle is what hairstyle I can do while transitioning/when I’m natural. 


All my life I’ve been prone to headaches, most hairstyles give me one. Braids most of the time give me a headache except when I do knotless ones by myself. If I leave those down they’re fine and my head doesn’t hurt, but the problem is when I put them in a ponytail after an hour or two I get a headache, and my job requires me to tie my hair back for at least 8 hours a day. Wigs are the worst, I get a headache within an hour, and I also sweat a lot at work because it’s quite physical so it would be really uncomfortable to wear one. I’ve tried so many different ones but they all end with headaches. 


The only thing that doesn’t give me a headache is a weave with leaveout, even when I tie it into a ponytail. Weirdly even tying my own relaxed hair into a ponytail will give me headache after about 2 hours. The weave with leave out is easy because my hair is relaxed, and I straighten the leave out only about once a month, but if I was natural I think I would have to do it more frequently which would give me heat damage. 


My only option seems to be to cut my hair short and just wear it out, but I live in Canada where it gets really cold in Winter so I’m not sure that would be sustainable. 

Are there any other options I’m not thinking of? I hope it doesn’t seem like I’m making excuses, but I just don’t want to take the plunge yet without having a plan for how I’ll be able to deal with my headaches. Thanks so much for any advice!&&&Not tight at all. That’s why I do my braids myself - so I can control the tensions. When I put my hair into a ponytail, even if I loosen it to the point where if I shake my head it’ll fall off, the headache won’t go away till I take it out.&&&They don’t hurt for me either, it’s when I have to tie them back that there’s a problem after a couple hours. Maybe I’ll try twisting my hair&&&Thank you, I can’t for the life of me figure out how to do a bun on the top of my head without it being uncomfortable, even with knotless braids. But maybe I’ll try that again, you’re right that the problem could be the position of the bun&&&Thank you! It seems like twists may be the way to go"
Adept_Atmosphere_414,qe6tqb,"When do you try detangle your hair?
How are you detangling your hair?
With what are you detangling it with?
With what are you deep conditioning with?
Do you need a trim 

What does detangled hair mean to you? Because if in the natural state, a comb is never going to glide through like your hair is straight.

Start from the ends and work your way up to the root slowly and insure your hair is damp or moisturised (not dripping wet) When you hit a snag while detangling start from the bottom again. Try detangling when you are moisturizing.

I wish you the best with your hair.🤗&&&Another problem may be how you're washing and deep conditioning, if it's all loose and out and your are vigorously shampooing and scrunching your hair around you are making the knots worse. If you constantly wear your hair in it's natural state and not a stretched state you are asking for more knots and greater difficulty"
Angelinapatina,qe6tqb,Possibly hydral fatigue
Lacasadelmango,qe6tqb,I detangle BEFORE shampooing and conditioning. I use the African Pride pre-poo and detangle in 4-6 sections. I then wash and condition my hair in those sections so it doesn't get tangled again.
Maleficent-Tip2749,qe6tqb,This! The best prepoo I ever used. The slip is crazy!
Missgenius44,qe6tqb,When was the last time you trimmed your hair? Also part your hair before going into the shower
NuBoston,qe6tqb,It might be damaged or you may have split ends.
copperbutton,qe6tqb,Can you be more specific about how you are trying to detangle?  I normally apply a leave-in detangler while my hair is still dripping wet from my final rinse.   I work from he bottom up with a Tangle-Teezer while still in the shower.   No towel drying of any kind until that's done.
httpantwon,qe6tqb,Why won’t my 4b hair detangle at all after shampooing and deep conditioning?&&&
justfloating_,qe6tqb,"Is your shampoo really harsh, sometimes after using a shampoo that’s too harsh It can mess with a pH of hair and even if you use a conditioner  afterwards it still may be hard to detangle. So I will check your shampoo as even though some shampoo say moisturising they are actually quite clarifying and affect the pH"
nile_breaker,qe6tqb,"Lots of great answers and questions so far - I want to add one. Are you using heat during conditioning? I use a hothead bonnet for 30 minutes, a world of difference and a time saver when detangling. I also use a large toothed comb and Leatherwood detangling brush! Best of luck!"
olybiggie,qe6tqb,Also use your hands most of the time to detangle.Our fingers are the best wide tooth comb when it comes to detangling.when you can run your whole fingers from the roots to the tips of your hair then you can introduce a wide tooth comb and this must be done in sections
