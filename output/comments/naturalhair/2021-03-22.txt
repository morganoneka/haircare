Forgivenlight,mf4iz9,"Does it have to be done when your hair is long or short, because my barber said he needed to make my hair short to do it and instead of a tapered hairline, he gave me a receded hairline"
OmegaFoxFire,mf4iz9,"Do I need a tapered hairline for twists?&&&I want to do two strand twists on myself as both a protective style and a new look. I previously wanted to do cornrows and read that you should taper your hairline so the braids don’t pull it back. Does the same thing apply for twists? While I don’t mind tapering my hairline, I just moved and don’t yet trust my barber with something that important."
Red-Print,mf4iz9,"I’ve tapered my hairline twice. It definitely is not necessary, but you aren’t mistaken—tapering the hairline will help prevent over-manipulating and pulling out hairs in the front. It will also help to keep a clean lineup without possibly cutting the hair you are trying to grow out. I have mine tapered since I do twists around once a month (4c, low porosity), but you don’t have to!"
JellyBiafra54321,mewv2n,Absolutely amazing! You and your hair are Gorgeous!
MeetTheBrewers,mewv2n,"My hair completely stretched back in 2016 VS my hair shrunken in a wash and go 2021. (My hair shrinks about 90% of it’s length when wet, I have 4c hair.) When you think you’re not making any progress just take a look back at your old photos for motivation. 🙌&&&"
SoloMuffin,mewv2n,That is a lot of growth.  BTW your skin is glowing.
astraeoth,mewv2n,"That hair must be like 2 feet long or more. You look amazing. When it doesn't feel like it has grown at all, just tug on a strand and physically see the growth."
