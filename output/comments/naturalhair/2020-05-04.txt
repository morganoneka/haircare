Ashleyjasmine,ghavbd,I swear by the kera care silken seal heat protectant! I’ve had a few a hair stylists use it on me before silk presses  so I tried it out for myself. Literally makes the hair feel like silk and you don’t need a lot. I blow dry my hair fairly frequently and I haven’t gotten damage or breakage. It has water soluble silicones in it.
schemagirl,ghavbd,"best heat protectant for low porosity, type 4 hair?&&&i am buying a revlon one step hair dryer and brush that i plan on using to help stretch my hair. what is the best heat protectant i could use for this, considering my hair type? preferably something i can buy in store because i will be picking up my hair dryer tomorrow, thank you!"
MaryOutside,ghauxo,Good hair day? Great hair day! What's your routine?
UrDadsFave,ghauxo,Oh you're about to have a fun time! What you gonna name him?
byyouiamundone,ghauxo,Bruh I just Awwww’d so loud. What a cutie! And such lovely hair
drinkinghatorade,ghauxo,"Good hair day and a new pup!&&&&&&His name is Enzo! If you have any puppy training tips, by all means throw them my way!&&&Thank you! He looks like a little Teddy Bear!&&&Thank you! I think he already knows he’s cute?&&&Thank you so much! I wash and condition w Pantene gold series, then do the repairing mask for 30 mins, then rinse out. Then i use a butter, oil and a LITTLE bit of curling pudding to do a twist out, which i leave in for about 32 hrs, then i take it out & pick it out! I do 2 pineapples at night so the style can last for like 3 days before i do twists to make it last another couple days. 
- i can achieve a very similar look without twisting my hair (obviously tighter curls that is shorter), but it never lasts more than a day, because my curls get hella flat and stringy so i do this approach because it just holds for so much longer&&&Thank you so much! He’s adorable!&&&Thank you! I felt like we kinda matched haha&&&Thank you so much! 🥰"
findingmymelanin,ghauxo,Yorkie's are my fave! You both look beautiful!
got2luvcakes,ghauxo,I love your hair and your new pup! He is so cute!

pineapplejuice6667,ghauxo,You’re literally stunning
CoffeeB4Talkie,ghanh6,"A mask is a deep conditioner..... Or am I missing something?

I wouldn't suggest applying it daily."
lavasca,ghanh6,"Hydrating mask on ends daily?&&&&&&Thankyou.  😎&&&I have little discipline for time consuming routines.  My quarantine style is a twist/sisterloc deal.

I must cleanse my scalp every 2-3 days or I’ll
get a rash. I thought I bought deep conditioner— for which I also have no patience — but instead I have two hydrating masks.  Why not just put the masks on my ends daily, if not every other day?  Then,  I can just coconut oil the ends to seal the moisture. That, or shea butter?

Any suggestions or opinions?"
montero19,ghanh6,"Weekly maybe but I wouldn’t do it daily, you want to avoid hydra fatigue"
ClutchinMyPearls,gh8s0p,"My phases since 2018&&&&&&Left is my taper cute June 2018. Top right is blowout and trim from last month and bottom right is last Sunday, freshly washed with no product yet.

Edit: The title should be June 2018 and Current since I didn't show any pics of growth progress😁"
aka209,gh8s0p,Thanks for sharing! Would love more pics I like that you showed what your hair looked like when it was short and long I recently cut my hair and rn it’s between twa and shoulder length so it’s really awkward. I’ve been scouring the internet for ppl with similar textures so that I can see how my curls will look when long. The only thing keeping me going 🙄
Muncamunca,gh7vmo,"Can I use color 1b extensions instead of color 2?&&&I'm looking for hair extensions for twists and I'm a color 2. 1b is a lot easier to find and it's cheaper but I'm scared that it won't be my color. Color 2 is perfect for my hair (I cannot stress this), but my wallet doesn't like how expensive it can be compared to getting 1b. Anyways, can I use 1b?"
elitedisplayE,gh7vmo,"this is going to sound strange, but i think it might depend on whether it's human extensions or synthetic.  For crochet braids, cornrows, 2 matches my hair and 1b is too black.  For human hair extensions, 2 is too brown and 1b or ""natural color"" is perfect."
SleepieSheepie8,gh2pmp,"Maybe tea tree oil or peppermint oil. I find that they have a very cool touch when used. Also maybe finding a dermatologist to help you. Relaxers are extremely damaging to the hair follicle and if used on the scalp for long periods of time, I imagine it can make it highly irritable."
UnclearGarden,gh2pmp,"I second the comments saying relaxing your hair can make your scalp more sensitive - plus it also damages the hair shaft, making the hair actually more prone to tangling and more difficult to detangle than healthy natural hair.

Relaxing (like bleaching) is controlled damage to the hair shaft to change its physical properties - in both cases it weakens the bonds in the hair shaft, which raises the cuticles along the length and makes it easier for the individual strands to interlock and tangle. 

I don't say that to judge, as I myself have bleached hair and used to relax it, just as a reminder that sometimes straighter hair doesn't necessarily mean easier to detangle :) Healthy, moisturized hair is easier to deal with!

Detangling can also be less of a hassle with the right tools and products! Ie the ones that work for you - look for conditioners with a ton of slip and the right detangling brush. There's one conditioner from Shea moisture that did nothing particularly interesting for my hair but to this day is the best detangler I've ever used - the brush would just glide through when I used it! It was the 10-in-one multi benefit hair masque (again, I personally only saw one benefit and it was that detangling was done in about minute and a half). 

Good luck!"
formyfrog,gh2pmp,"I'm at a crossroad! What are some ways to deal with tender headedness? (Details in comments).&&&&&&Thanks for the information! I really didn't recognize all the damage relaxers can do, since my hair isn't a horror story and I've never really had problems maintaining it (other than scalp tenderness). I really like having length so when I do the BC, I'll definitely want to be prepared to deal with long curly hair. I'm gonna have to look into that hair masque too. Thank you for your suggestion!&&&I am debating on getting the big chop because shops are closed and no one can relax my hair. I have been relaxed for 17 years now, that pic was last month. (I know this isn't a relaxed hair forum but hear me out). 

I have 4c hair and the only reason I relax my hair is because I am tender headed. I'm terrified to go natural for that reason. I STILL cry when detangling my relaxed hair, so I'm worried on how to handle detangling when it's no longer straight. What are some ways you deal with kinky hair when you're severely tender headed?&&&That makes sense, I'll look into it. Thanks for the input!"
AnalTattoo,ggylfz,Beautiful!
Dreadindian,ggylfz,Happy MOTHERS DAY mama♥️ Her Locs are fake but smile is real. Keep Smiling:))&&&
KindResist0,ggylfz,Happy Mother’s Day to her!!! If I may ask; where mama get her locs from? 🤔

nicococo6785,ggw3sp,"Should I cut all my hair off and start again?&&&Hello my natural brothers and sister, I hope you are all well!

I have 4c hair but I suffer from a lot of breakage especially when taking down braids. My hair has never grown past my mid neck and I would love to see it flourish and get thicker. Does anyone have any advice on how they fixed breakage and hair loss when it comes to 4c hair.

Thanks guys x"
tacothetacotaco,ggw3sp,"I'm having the same conundrum. My hair has grown about 1 inch in the 9 years since I stopped pressing every 2 weeks. Almost a decade of protective styles and trying a million products and barely any growth to show for it. I'm not cutting off all my hair, but I'll probably cut at least half of it off and try to change up my routine a little while it (hopefully) grows back. Good luck."
the-wifi-is-broken,ggw3sp,"It’s up to you if you wanna cut and restart but give braids a rest and wear your hair out for a while, and make sure you moisturize your hair while in braids, not maintaining it is probably what causes the breakage"
AnalTattoo,ggsuyo,Very lovely!

the-wifi-is-broken,ggsuyo,"I got my hair tapered and I am really feeling it&&&&&&The first time I went natural and big chopped I hated my short hair so much and couldn’t wait till I had length... now that I had to take care of shoulder length+ hair (and mine is thick as fuck)... tapered doesn’t sound too bad tbh lolll

I can’t wait to style her myself, I’m vibing with a rod set the stylist did&&&My sister had it made when she was in her honeymoon in Tanzania🤗"
wooweeitszea,ggsuyo,Adorable!
Bluestreetlightss,ggsswm,"What can I do about my hair after deva curl?&&&I’ve been using deva curl for a few months now but I don’t use it very consistently. I’ve estimate used it about 8 times all together? I’ve finished a 3oz deep conditioner and used a quarter of an 8oz deep conditioner(I have one other devacurl product I haven’t opened yet.) I’ve noticed my curl pattern has changed even with my limited use (I remember googling if deep conditioner can change your pattern because my curls changed from 3c/4a to appearing wavy when dry. I’m not sure what to do at this point. Can my hair recover from this? And I don’t know what products to switch to. After this, i don’t plan to use any products on my hair (other than natural oils) except for shampoo and deep conditioner. Are shea moisture products okay?&&&Thank you for the recommendation. Do you know if Camille Rose is also good?"
atctia,ggsswm,"Shea Moisture us okay, but I prefer Mielle and TGIN products. The Mane Choice is also a good brand. Also, you still want to make sure you have a good moisturizer for your hair. All the brands I mentioned have really good leave in conditioners"
chikn_nuggit,ggsswm,"My favorite brands are Shea Moisture, Cantu, Head and Shoulders, and African Pride."

expiredcornbread,ggp688,"Question: This is the deep conditioner that I use. Would it be okay if I added peppermint oil to it and let it sit in my hair? And if I did add it in, would it fine to use under heat?&&&&&&Do you mean using this deep conditioner + peppermint oil should be used every few months? Why?"
wormymcwormyworm,ggp688,This is something that should be used once every few months (2-3 months) not weekly.
askenned8,gglkv6,"I use vegetable glycerin for moisture and it works pretty well. I spray my hair with a mix of water, jojoba oil, and knot today then work the glycerin through. It does nothing for detangling/styling though"
lovelylj,gglkv6,"4c low porosity, freshly washed - looking for - best advice for retaining moisture? Best products. And styles for this length? Is there anyone with hair like mine who've been successful? I'm trying to create a routine&&&&&&I think I have some vegetable glycerin so I can try that. I'm out of knot today and jojoba oil (I'm gonna have to order, I haven't been going out)&&&I used the aloe juice before but I think I needed to mix it with oil it made my hair hard (it could be our water too, today is hopefully our last day with hard water we are getting a water filtration system installed)&&&I've been trying to protective style it (flat twists) but I've been getting these massive headaches, I end up taking them out&&&I always forget about hot oil. I'll add that to the routine too."
tamoki30,gglkv6,"HOT OIL TREATMENT!!! Every couple of days. Also, protective styling. Crochet braids/ wigs/ as long as it’s tucked away and safe so it can keep flourishing."
xoNaria,gglkv6,"Aloe vera juice has been working well for me in terms of moisture. I love twists at all lengths, but that's just me :)"

UrDadsFave,gghd97,"I used to do everything with my hair twisted. Wash, condition, rinse, slide my little product in. Let it dry and boom, twist out was cracking."
hyperhoshiko,gghd97,Can I use a tea treatment on my twist 🤔?&&&I’m washing my hair today and I’m gonna try doing it in twists. They’re not to big and not to small. I already watched some videos on how to wash and deep condition my hair in twists but I’m wondering if the same applies to using a tea rinse. If I have to unravel my hair it’s not that big a deal but I would rather not lol
mecraziiiii,gghd97,Yes of course just rinse throughly
