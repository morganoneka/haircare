PacifisticHypocrite,7r6oid,"How to tell if your hair is damaged ?&&&Heyy , mobile so please forgive formating issues .

I'm M with 4c and for the last 18 and a half years I've never really paid my hair much mind.(rarely moisturized or greased it and picked it out dry no or soaked in water)

For the last couple months I've been making a effort to get it healthy for it to start growing again . It doesn't seem to hold moisture for a full day nor grow past a certain point and for a 19 year old I have 2-3 bald spots (thankfully they're only visible no it isn't picked out)

My sister said it may be damaged but she's not sure and that it make be better to cut it all off and start fresh so all my hair will grow and be healthy .

Is there anyway to tell for sure ?

Tl;dr: hair no grow , bald spots , how to tell if damaged beyond repair ?&&&Liquid oil and cream
Water black castor oil and curl enhancing smoothie or afican pride olive miracle

Every day sometimes every other day&&&I'll try that . Think that over deep conditioner ? I think damage , my dad doesn't have any ."
TheYellowRose,7r6oid,"If your hair isn't growing longer, it is breaking off. Black hair tends to do that. You need to find products that your hair actually absorbs. I leave my conditioner on for over an hour and it helps a lot. Are the bald spots due to damage or just natural balding?"
nightmooth,7r6oid,">It doesn't seem to hold moisture for a full day 

What is your routine ?

BoxedBoobs,7r3qrf,THANK YOU! It seems like all of the posts recently are someone promoting their video that no one asked for. 
Crushed1ce,7r3qrf,So I was hoping to find a place where people can share pics of their cool styles and transformations into Natural. Is there a place for that?

Sauce45,7qsio9,"Is wearing a haiRclip okay for my Transitioning hair?&&&I’m trying to transition and my curls look like a mess. So I thought while transitioning, I’ll just wear my hair in a side parted  pony tail however I always have pieces of hair sticking out, so I use 2-3 hair clips to keep them in place. Are hair clips ok for transitioning? Like I hope it doesn’t create damage to my hair that I want to grow longer. 

This is the type of hair clip I use

gliitterfraps,7qsio9,"I don't think hair clips will damage the hair unless you feel the clips pulling on the hair. Then you know its adding stress to the hair. I have 4c hair. While I was transitioning I did the halo bread a lot. My halo was't as thick and chunky as someone with longer hair but it was still cute. And I used bobby pins, you know, the bigger ones to keep my hair in place."
draizetrain,7qju6i,"So cute. I tried this after my big chop and just couldn’t get it to lay down for the life of me! Did what you’re doing, even tried wrapping it, no luck. But this looks so cute"
xshanaeo,7qju6i,"See how I slicked down my short afro! New favourite hairstyle! <3 <3&&&&&&Awww thank you so much and thanks for watching! Was your hair completely cleared out? You have to make sure that your hair is completely detangled the whole time so that it can lay down flat. Also, I used Eco Styler gel but I know what works for one person's hair might not work for another's. So maybe you should find the right gel that works for you. Some persons use Snots like Gorilla snot for example (but there are different brands out there) or even mousse. I'm not sure if your hair is still short for this style, but if it is, keep trying! Thanks again for watching and please subscribe! I post videos weekly :-)"
