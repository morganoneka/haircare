Bbdino8,a8yvix,"Be patient and experiment. Try different things to see what could be causing breakage. 
Take pictures too. Because I always swear my hair isn't growing but then I look back and see it has. "
BombshellElle,a8yvix,"Fuck them popular kids. 
They sound like douchebags. Ik HS is hard..but you are NOT your hair...watch some YouTube tutorials..moisterize...and experiment to find something that works for YOU. I LOVE how afro puffs look..maybe even buy some fake puffs to attach to your own!"
MisSinterpreter123,a8yvix,"Awww dear, I want you to look in the mirror right now and tell yourself you're beautiful.

I can sit here and tell you how everyone is insecure and you should have to be you, say some cliche trope about how your season is coming and to be patient but you don't want to hear that. That won't help you right now. What will help you is to somehow get your self esteem up. 

Kids can be cruel, that has never changed. I can't tell you to not listen to them because I understand those words can be etched in your memory, but you have to be strong. You have to know you are so worthy and you are so beautiful. 

You have to know that it does not matter how many tips we give you to retain length, the issue isn't the hair, it's your self esteem. Your hair is the way it's supposed to be. Often times we look to people who have something we want (in this case longer hair) and think how better our life would be if we got it, but we don't know if we can handle it. We compare our behind the scenes to someone else's highlight reel. If you had longer/looser curled hair, you may find it too cumbersome. 

TL;DR: The hair isn't the issue, work on your mental health and figure out what's the root behind this feeling of inadequacy."
Spy_cut_eye,a8yvix,"First of all, I am sorry you are feeling this way. I have been natural for 10+ years and my hair doesn't grow quickly either. It is very frustrating when every one around you has these big fluffy 'fros. You can work on your hair care regimen which may or may not lead to long hair, but in the meantime, you have to deal with the hair you have right now.

I say wear the braids if you are happier with the braids.  There is nothing wrong with them. 

Consider styles like crochet braids which can be friendlier and cause less breakage.  As others have said, you need to take care of the hair even when it is in braids (moisturizing, not causing stress) and make sure you change out the braids regularly so that you don't get matting which can cause more breakage.  In between braids, baby your hear with deep conditioning, moisturizing, carefully detangling. 

I am sure you are doing this already, but find youtubes of people with hair like yours - looking at people with hair that isn't like yours can make you more dissatisfied.  

If you see someone with hair like yours in real life and you like what they have done, ask them for help!  Ask about products, hair stylists, regimens, what struggles they have had...Nobody got this right on the first try. The struggle is real! I guarantee they will do their best to help you. 

Lastly, there are a lot of cute short styles that you can cut your hair into, even for round faces.   Look on youtube, pinterest, instagram. "
a-midnight-flight,a8yvix,"Believe it or not... Everyone is insecure in High School. So they always project their insecurities on others that they know have been a target previously by others. Navigating the school years are tough, but they aren't forever. 

&#x200B;

It took me years to learn that after graduating and even still today (11 years ago) I still have some left over feelings about things that were said to me during High School and my younger years. Your hair doesn't make you nor does it devalue your beauty and self worth.   


There is no such thing as ugly hair in my eyes. Only healthy and unhealthy hair. I suggest you start with owning the length of your natural hair. Look at all the wonderful hair styles with women with short hair or completely shaven. Wear hair scarfs or other accessories to accent it. I actually challenge you to avoid doing braids. Don't let one hairstyle be your safety net out of insecurities others are trying to force you to develop.   


Also braiding your hair too tight and too much without letting it rest for a while can also damage your hair as well. Another reason to switch up your hairstyles some. "
emmdubb22,a8yvix,"Seriously, just wear the braids if you feel most comfortable with them. Braids can be very versatile. However, remember to care for your hair underneath. Oil and massage your scalp, deep condition often and remember to trim your hair. I get trims twice a year. Also, since you do get braids, perhaps you get them too tight? That could be a reason why you aren’t seeing growth as well. A huge factor is what you are eating on a regular basis, you must eat nutrient dense foods. "
lavasca,a8yvix,"I agree.&&&1. Forget those jerks. They aren’t being raised right and don’t have kind personalities.

2. I feel for you but once you graduate you won’t have to see them again.

3. Eat healthy. Continuously research this even if it means asking the health teacher more and following the meal prep and whole foods subs.

4. Keep your braids. Make sure they aren’t too tight though."
love-ya-lots,a8yvix,"I hate my natural hair/ hair growth tips&&&So, I really really hate my natural hair. I honestly feel ashamed to wear it out because it is short. Stretched, it barely reaches my shoulders. When I was in middle school I wasn’t really that insecure about it but now that I’m in high school and I guess kinda popular people call me bald headed. And my hair just won’t grow. I want to keep my hair in braids and tucked away at allll times. I don’t even loook right with short hair my head is too big. The only time I feel confident is when I’m wearing braids. Without them I feel ugly...
I see girls with longer natural hair and I wish my hair could be there length. At least long enough to put my hair into a bun... sometimes I cry at night because I wish I could have longer hair and that I had a different cute curl pattern. My hair makes me ugly and I don’t know what to do. All I want is long hair 
&&&It’s just that on me I look ugly. I look much better with longer hair &&&What are some examples of dense foods ?&&&Yeah I think I will just stick with braids. Love if my hair will hopefully come with length "
radgyal,a8yvix,I can relate so much omg
tangerineprincess,a8yvix,"first and foremost, **you are not ugly.** remember that! retain that! repeat it to yourself as often as you need, but *know it* because it's true. the reality is that there's always going to be someone to compare ourselves to, and we'll always want for something about ourselves to be different, but that kind of mindset isn't sustainable and you deserve much better for yourself.

&#x200B;

as far as those kids, pay no mind to them. i know it's easier said than done, but nothing outside of you should ever affect how you feel about yourself and how you present to the world. trust me when i say that i went through something very similar as a kid/teenager, and it affected me so negatively that i did things to my hair that were seriously damaging trying to live up to someone else's standard of what was pretty. ultimately, it doesn't matter what they think and it should never color the way you see yourself - you're beautiful, you have hair that you can say is absolutely unlike anyone else's (one of the many magical things about natural hair) and even if it takes some time and active work on your part, you will get to a point where appreciating that hair is second nature and when that time comes, you'll wonder how you ever could've wished to change anything about yourself. i promise.

&#x200B;

(that said - if the braids make you comfortable? then go for it. do what makes you happy right now and what makes you feel confident. just know that with or without, you're stunning and nobody else's opinion can diminish that.) 🌻"
cindysandjo,a8xy57,How to remove hair beads from braids - Super Entertaining Tutorial&&&[removed]
AdamantiumFoil,a8vgrk,"Sure. Water by itself is a moisturizer. But you'll still need to seal in that moisture with an oil or butter/cream, or both, depending on what your hair likes."
BadMouthBarbie,a8vgrk,"Yes. I used to use aloe by itself as a moisturizer after I went natural. Back the. We didn’t have the range of products we have now and I didn’t have many options. I think you would need a sealant on top to help ‘lock’ the moisture in. I used to use olive olive oil, but there are lots of occlusives that could work - jojoba, Rose hip seed, coconut oil, shea butter, cocoa butter, etc. 

If you just use aloe alone, a lot of that moisture will evaporate pretty quickly. You need a sealant on top to keep it locked in. "
Gabbaby,a8vgrk,"Can aloe Vera juice mixed with water be a moisturizer?&&&Generally speaking, could it be a staple moisturizer in a routine? Rather than say your typical moisturizing creams  etc? &&&Thank you! What do you use now, if you don’t mind sharing? &&&How often do you use it? &&&Do you also use an oil or anything after?&&&I haven’t used only aloe Vera and water yet, but I would spray my hair with the bottles type. I don’t have any oil that I use regularly lol. Though, I use a butter, if that counts as a sealant? "
Port64,a8vgrk,"How do you use it, in a spray bottle or do you mix it in a jar? Do you use a fresh aloe leaf (for lack of a better word) or do you buy a good quality bottled type like Lily of the Valley?  How do you incorporate the oils, put it on top after you’ve added the aloe and water or add the oil into the mixture?  "
SweetTNWhiskey,a8vgrk,"Yes, that my go to leave in"
_CoachMcGuirk,a8vgrk,absolutely. that's what i use.
hexaneandheels_,a8vgrk,Yes! It works extremely well for me. 
kikkai,a8vgrk,I use the aloe vera juice in a spray bottle. It is a organic bottled type. I use oils after applying the aloe vera juice to my hair in sections.
ladyAnder,a8vgrk,"Yes. I used to use aloe quite a bit when I lived out in the middle of no-where and the stores around me didn't have a wide selection. 

Of course it was more like an aloe, water, and oil. However, there were some days where I would take a slice of an aloe leaf and just rub in my hair without the water. "
nezustih,a8vgrk,Be careful of it spoiling though. I would keep it refrigerated if you do.
King-of-the-Sky,a8le9r,"Does it matter what type of rice you use. Originally, I got long grain white rice, but I was thinking about getting Jasmine rice for my next batch."
_CoachMcGuirk,a8le9r,Does it work meaning what?
babykcm,a8le9r,I heard that it’s like a protein treatment because it’s a lot of protein in it so if you have low porosity hair don’t do it 
luckyseaturtle,a8le9r,"I've done it a few times, so has my mom.  My most recent was because I accidentally gave myself a bald spot. She does it for her edges. So far, we've gotten nothing but good results. I saw growth in my bald spot in about 3 days and her edges have come back a bit too. I must stress that this is like a protein treatment, so it will dry out your hair if you use it too often. Here's the method I use from a woman on YouTube named Dr. Debbie:

1 cup of rice to 1 cup of water (Make sure the water is purified. I use the water from my fridge)

Rinse the rice well and place into a container with your purified water. Let this sit for 12-24 hours.

Wash your hair with a sulfate free shampoo, condition, then pour the rice water onto your head. Make sure to cover roots to tips. 

Place a shower cap on your head and let the water sit for 30-60 minutes. After this time, rinse. 

After this, I'll either condition my hair again, or put in my leave in. It depends on whether or not I'm willing to sit with conditioner on one more time, lol. 

Mind you, results do vary from person to person. "
nigerianity,a8le9r,Rice water on natural hair ?&&&I thought about getting into this trend but does it actually work as a means to strengthen and grow hair ? What methods in preparing the rice give better results? &&&OMG THANKS ! &&&If you do it too much right ? &&&Sorry I was rambling. I’ll edit it. 
sqoorelfreend,a8le9r, I've heard some people say it dries their hair out 
babykcm,a8dzpp,"Go to YouTube 🙂! that’s how I find most of my products . Some good ones are : Viv hair therapy,
NickyBnatural, Fusionofcultures( I love her😊😊), olive chels, kaice Alea, Curly proverbs, efikzara, green beauty, shanuque buntyn & Therra Tasha ZA. Yeah . These girls recommend products & do reviews to help you find great products for your hair & what to avoid for your hair. None of these girls have 3C hair but they all have low porosity hair . Low porosity hair is low porosity hair no matter what hair type so hope this help good luck 😁"
clare_bear88,a8dzpp,Also 3c/ 4a low porosity. My hair hates Shea moisture. I love Oyin products. They're a black owned company from Baltimore. I love their hair dew. It's light but moisturizing. I use it for my braid outs daily and I get good results. I usually order their large bottle online but depending where you live you might be able to find them at CVS.
latisha05,a8dzpp,Low Porosity Hair&&&So I recently did the hair strand test in water and it seems that my hair is low porosity. I have 3c/4a hair.  I have to admit I am a product junkie and now I want to try different products to see if there is a big difference. I usually like to wear my hair in a pineapple.  I am thinking about trying the Kinky Curly brand or Curls brand. I am not a fan of most Shea Moisture products as they seem to just sit on my hair. What products does your low porosity hair love?
shayprice,a8dzpp,"Honey, olive oil, black novex are things that work for me. Try to heat your deepco’s and use hot oil treatments. Heat is your friend. I have low porosity and got medium to thick hair strands. "
unwaveringwish,a8dzpp,"Heat is definitely your friend! Warm up products in a hot water bath and use warm water on hair. Deep condition with heat. Etc etc&&&As I Am, Camille Rose, and Mane Choice are the best! "
BrieAlysse,a88pg2,Yes as the person said above a trim. You don’t have to trim on a certain schedule (every 3 months or something) but trim when needed. This is a sign of needing a trim and once you do get a trim make sure you baby your ends by giving them extra care. 
PBlacks,a88pg2,"Knotting ends&&&My ends keep knotting up really badly and I have no idea why, or how to prevent or fix it. I finger-detangle carefully but am inevitably left with a moderately-sized ball of knotted hair danglng on the end of a tiny section. Does anyone have any tips? &&&Possibly a year ago?&&&Update: I trimmed the ends with hair shears and it's been tangling FAR less! Thanks for the advice, folks!"
ThePastJack,a88pg2,"I comb my hair from the tips and work my way up to the scalp, and then add a bit of oil to the ends. That might help your hair or like the other comments said trim the knots out."
babykcm,a88pg2,They need a trim or they’re very dry . Try to trim them first and if nothing change try applying products mostly to the ends during your hair care routine 🙂 and make sure your using very moisturizing products 🙂
fiery_mergoat,a88pg2,When was the last time you had a trim?
plumgum,a88pg2,"Yeah as the other commenter said, this usually means that you have split ends and need a trim. I literally only learnt this like last week when i went to the salon to get a silk press. She was like “errrrr ... whens the last time you had a trim?” And i was like “never” lol. Then she told me that its really important to get regular trims because split ends travel up the hair! They don’t just fall out they make your hair worse and prevent growth! So now i’m going to be trimming my own ends every month or so. Just thought i’d pass on the great advice i got! Good luck"
EScafeme,a85k6u,"How soft should my hair be?&&&For context: I'm a guy with ~8 in 4b/c hair

My hair is really soft (think like velvet, but curly) and I wonder if this is normal or if it is because I wash it too often. 

I wouldn't say my hair is immaculate or anything, like I don't even follow a set regime, but I do get a lot of comments from women (sister, mom, lady friends) who play in my hair that it's really soft. I've dated a few natural hair folk with looser and better curls, who have real hair regimes, but their hair always feels much rougher and resilient than mine.

I let my hair get wet everyday in the shower because I like the way it curls up, but I wash once a week and condition twice a week. I've been wondering about this for a little bit as it concerns the health of my hair. Should I switch anything up? "
tabby_whiskers,a85k6u,"Sounds like you're doing something right. The only thing that concerns me is whether it tangles when you get it wet, which would lead to breakage, but you have some length so it seems to be fine. Other than that, there's no ""should"" when it comes to softness. Everyone's hair is different and everyone needs to find what works right for them!"
BooBootheFool22222,a7pgjs,"can you see flakes on your scalp? if it's the scalp i probably wouldn't wash every week. 

i've used cantu leave in for a few years now and it's never flaked on me but i have 4b/c hair."
MisSinterpreter123,a7pgjs,"First, forget hair type. That means NOTHING. 

Figure out what your porosity and density are so you can figure out if a product works for you. 

Regarding the flaking, if you're only using a leave in, not sure why you're flaking. If you want to know if a product will flake in your hair, mix the products in your hand and if you see white beads, it will flake. 

Use the shampoo, conditioner and rinse out in cold water then wait about 10 minutes and see what happens. If your hair doesn't flake, go forward with the leave in in a SMALL section of the hair and wait 5-10 minutes. If you don't see any flaking, good, if you do, you know the cause. "
Orbitzz1,a7pgjs,"Help!&&&I’m a male with 3c hair type. It may be 4a I’m not sure, it’s pretty thick. 

Anyways to the problem, I’m currently using Carols Daughter sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and Cantu leave in. I’m not sure which product it is or if it’s just dry scalp. I wash my hair 1 time a week, but I still will have flaking and it’s really annoying. Any tips on how to prevent this? &&&Thanks! I suspected it to be that.  Any recommended product?&&&Thanks! This was very informative.

Just a question how do you find out porosity and density? I’m sure I can YouTube it lol 

After closer examination, It’s not really flaking. It look more like build up. Kind of waxy later near the root of my hair. "
afrotina,a7pgjs,"Definitely get rid of the Cantu. Cantu has been found to contain alcohol, which is very drying. "
rosemarygirl2456,a7pgjs,I would try switching out the cantu.  I had the same issue and I have 3c/4a hair.
tangerineprincess,a7pgjs,"ugh, cantu absolutely killed my hair - i'm kinda between 3c/4a as well. one line that's worked wonders for me has been shea moisture, specifically the one in the dark reddish bottle with the gold label. i think it's manuka honey? that and the product line with the yellow label and the jamaican black castor oil are my two favorites and have worked wonders for me, especially with retaining moisture and keeping my texture defined."
BeefJerkyFan90,a7fqeh,"Seborrheic dermatitis more present when natural?&&&I have Seborrheic dermatitis. My scalp gets very itchy and even bleeds if I scratch too much, especially at the nape of my neck. I've gone back and forth between relaxers and natural hair for the past 7 years or so. Right now I'm almost 5 months into my transition back to natural hair, and I've noticed that my scalp issues have returned, considering the fact that I have some new growth now. I didn't have this issue when I had relaxers. Does anyone know why my Seborrheic dermatitis would act up more when my hair is natural compared to when my hair is relaxed?&&&I used Head and Shoulders clinical strength shampoo. I will probably have to go back to using that shampoo, and shampooing twice a week or so.&&&I have heard of black soap and used it to treat my son's eczema, but never thought to use it to treat my scalp issues! Ulta Beauty has this acv scalp scrub that I want to try.&&&I've used so many different products within the past 7 years, but currently I'm using pink oil lotion and ORS carrot oil hair dressing cream because it's what I have on hand."
Dahliacid,a7fqeh,I use black soap or acv to wash my hair and I use aloe Vera mixed with water and castor oil mixed with tea tree and vitamin e  to help treat mine. 
Darth_Blazer9418,a7fqeh,"Yeah this happens to me too. It gets unbearable sometimes. I’ve used T-gel, prescription strength and non prescription strength Ketoconazole, and dog dandruff shampoo and conditioner. The best thing was probably the prescription strength ketoconazole shampoo, but it was a tedious process and required hair washing daily. "
MisSinterpreter123,a7fqeh,"I've has seborrehic dermatitis my whole life, I've been natural for 3 years in March. Get a dermatologist, you'll probably be prescribed an oil or shampoo. 

Stop scratching your head, if it's bleeding that's a serious issue and you want to make sure you haven't caused damage.

Also, try scalp exfoliatation once a week. I use ManeKrush Skrubb but you can make your own scalp scrub mixture. 

Good luck."
Purpleroyalty68,a7fqeh,Has anyone ever used Emuaid Max for Seborrheic dermatitis ? My baby has scaly flaky scalp with some bald patches..have been to dermatologist and tried everything . Works for a while then it comes back.
Sailor_Moonie,a7fqeh,"Mine gets really bad and scabby. If you want to remain natural it may be trial and error, but some things that helped me. Washing in warm water. I’ve washed my hair in really hot water for as long as I can remember, this helped me so much. Use a brush that can reach your scalp. I use this denman brush, not the regular one but a round brush with boar AND nylon bristles. Buy the large if you have very dense/thick hair. It helps distribute the oil and improve circulation to your scalp. This won’t eliminate your problems but it will hopefully help. I also use a sulfate free shampoo."
TuffTitti,a7fqeh,I noticed the same thing - I think chemicals fry the bacteria on the scalp. And adding natural oils to the hair exacerbate the problem. I use a lot of tea tree oil & use petroleum products which the bacteria on the scalp can't grow in
Worstmodonreddit,a7fqeh,What products are you using? I'm my experience switching products makes a HUGE difference
knight_ofdoriath,a7fqeh,"Actually, the reason I went natural is because the perms were irritating my scalp. I used Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo and it helps a great deal. And I went to the dermatologist to get a lotion to rub on my scalp. Never get the shampoo! It broke my damn hair off something terrible. "
ladyvamplips,a7fqeh,I used to struggle with the same thing during the 2 years I was natural. Almost immediately after starting wash and goes it would get horrible. After I shaved my head 6 months ago I never had a flare up again. I'm assuming the reason why is because the oils on our scalps cant travel very well on oily hair and the dead skin and oils builds up so much easier on the scalp. 
lavasca,a7fqeh,"It maybe worth it to consult both a hairdresser and a dermatologist.  The hairdresser can possibly also describe the situation better to the doctor. Yes, the doctor can see your scalp but the hairdresser may be able to explain the both the relaxed and natural states and typical chemicals in a way a lay person cannot."
midnightslip,a7fqeh,"I had this and I started shampooing with selsun blue once a week and it went away. Anytime I feel my scalp getting itchy again, I bring out the selsun blue. It really helps"
MisSinterpreter123,a7fkbl,"You need a trim. Go to a professional, there are so many different types of shears and you don't want to get the wrong one and end up doing more damage with a DIY cut "
Thicc-Pea,a7fkbl,"Ends of my hair knotting and falling out?&&&Lately I've noticed that if I run my hands through my hair, I'll feel thick balls of hair which I can easily pull out. Does anyone else experience this?&&&You're probably right. I haven't gotten my hair cut in years 😬"
blackmagickchick,a7fkbl,"I'll maybe get little fairy knots, not thick balls of hair. Are you thoroughly detangling your hair and keeping it moisturized?"
cocolanoire,a7fkbl,You need a trim. Either from a professional or using professional shears. 
HumbleAbbreviations,a7dwbk,Not for me.  I have an oily scalp which I find disturbing.
NebraZebra,a7dwbk,*sulfates
solexchnage96,a7dwbk,Do not use shampoos with sulfur it causes your hair to become extremely dry.&&&
LadyLAJ,a7dvap,I custom make African Print bonnets. Any  and all sizes. 
Not_A_MadScientist,a7dvap,Thanks I needed this I have a scarf I will start to use I am starting my locks and this frustrating.
blackmagickchick,a7dvap,Make sure to get a big enough bonnet to fit your locs and maybe also double up with a silk scarf to be sure.
dunndundun0601,a7dvap,I either put my bonnet on then tie a scarf around the edges for the baby hairs or do a scarf then a bonnet. I haven’t had time to get a bigger bonnet

ARenee123,a74bz7,"If I’m straightening it like an hour, if I’m rocking it curly like 1.5-2 hrs "
Aaaandiiii,a74bz7,"I've managed to shorten it since I've mastered the wash and go. About 15 minutes for wash and detangling conditioning. Then it's about 30 minutes of detangling. I'll deep condition for maybe 30 minutes or just whenever... After that is the styling. If I do a wash and go, it's like 15 minutes of working with the gel followed by an hour of blow-drying where it don't get dry.

Twists however are easily an hour of devotion. I'm grateful that it's cold and I can appreciate a bird's nest on my head."
Ace_Turnip,a74bz7,"Longer than it should but thats probably because idk what kind of products my hair actually likes. 

Detangle with conditioner, shampoo, deep condition, twist. "

My twists take forever lol &&&I wash in twists too and deep condition! People think I’m crazy lol 
MsTreme,a74bz7,"Too damn long😭

Yesterday was wash day for me: shampoo, condition, oil, leave-in creme and twist.

I started at 530pm and finished at 740ish. My hair is super thick and I don’t usually do twist-outs. Wash n gos are my go-to for that exact reason😭"
TheYellowRose,a74bz7,"An hour or two.

 Wash with shampoo, add conditioner, finger detangle, add hair mask or deep conditioner.  Actually bathe while that sets in or get out and put a shower cap on.  Rinse with cool water, then dry with microfiber towel and add curl cream and air dry."
_CoachMcGuirk,a74bz7,"a little under an hour

-aloe vera pre poo, usually the night before (KOzPcXaNN80)

-wash with African black soap shampoo (zr9D0LNVZwc) or co-wash with watered down Trader Joes tea tree tingle conditioner 

-detailed wash routine (uSe_rmjxYT4) with the following notes:

- i usually detangle with Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist and don't deep condition out of the shower besides that Aussie DC
- i use the same watered down TTT as my leave in
- i don't rinse anything off
- i have more sections cause my hair is shorter

-after step 6 I use this Mango Cupuacu Butter Hair Cream (BChInQf9TeU) then flax seed gel (os0gI1vx1tw) **edit** mixed with the green eco styler, probably 1:1, ish

Then I shake my head back and forth and side to side like a dog to remove any excess and then wash my body. I don't dry my hair unless I'm doing this before work and it's winter. I try to just do it early enough where it air dries.

*Since this sub doesn't allow youtube links if you search what's in the parenthesis on Youtube you can find the recipes/videos, all from Naptural85.

and then what sucks is it looks fantastic the day I do it but cause I sleep on my back the morning after it's a fucking wreck and since I spray with aloe/water at least 1x a day and then seal with more mango butter hair cream at day 3 it's just....a sad memory of how it used to look :( I think if your hair is longer it can be so much easier to work with/stay cuter longer but I don't have the length yet, and it's just a huge Catch-22

*the first line"
beautyandbrains26,a74bz7,Usually about 2 hours including an hour of deep conditioning.
carmieeee,a74bz7,I wear blowouts mostly and do braidouts on that because I have high AF porosity hair (4b/c) so it shrinks like 50+%. It takes me about 2-2.5 hours to do my hair on wash days because detangling is a hassle and I deep condition for as long as I can push it. 
etoileleciel1,a74bz7,"About 4 hours. If I’m rushing, about 2 hours. My hair takes 2 days to completely dry. I have really thick hair and I make sure it stays at shoulder length/upper chest length because any longer would be more work.

lazycupcakee,a74bz7,"3-5 hours altogether because I'm lazy af and tired when I usually do my hair. I do it on a Friday night after school/work. Do the majority on at night and finish in the morning.

shampoo - takes anywhere from 10 to 30 to prevent scalp build-up

conditioner - if I do this quickly and how I'm supposed to, it takes 20-30 minutes under a steaming cap. It always takes me around 10-15 minutes to wash it all out and apply my deep conditioner/mask. 

deep conditioner - 20-30 under the steamer, but most of the time I usually let it sit in my hair overnight then wash it out once I get up. 

optional: give my hair a break.

Style: Leave In + Oil. I usually band it, so it only takes me 30-45 minutes. Then leave it dry for the rest of the day. "
originalsoul,a74bz7,I do wash days with my hair still in twists. I only detangle when my hair is stretched otherwise it feels like I'm detangling forever. 
tallulahbelly14,a74bz7,"About an hour and 15 mins, sometimes less.  I suspect I do a few things that are no-no’s for natural hair, but I can’t justify spending lots of time on my hair. 

For me it’s two rounds of co-wash conditioner, then a quick deep treatment or masque while I wash the rest of me / shave or whatever. Then quick towel dry and section hair into eight or ten. Each section gets some oil (argan or jojoba) and a cream or butter (whatever smells nice), a quick detangle with a Denman brush, and then twisted or braided. 

The next morning I untwist and style - it’s only 80% dry by then but I usually have to get to work. 

If I have a bit more time I’ll put on a shower cap after the treatment stuff and sit under the hood dryer for about 30 mins. Then wash off and twist. That would bring my time up to about two hours.

yourbestbudz,a74bz7,This is also how I do my wash routine. I have cut down my 2 hour process to 45 minutes by doing everything in the shower. 
BrieAlysse,a73a1m,Some people have gotten damage from a steamer. I just stick to my handy dandy heated cap and call it a day. 
Sharbubbles972,a73a1m,Is steamer better than a heat cap for deep conditioning&&&A lot of people keep talking about steamers. Just curious if this is the way to go instead. &&&Ahhh okay. I will definitely just get the heat cap then! Thanks!&&&I'm convinced :) Thank you for your help. Opting for the heat cap!
SuperAwesomeUN,a73a1m,"I used a steamer for about a year,  and honestly didn't see much difference between that and a shower cap with the edges wrapped by a scarf.

I think for the steamer may be more useful for hot oil treatments or oil- based deep conditions."
