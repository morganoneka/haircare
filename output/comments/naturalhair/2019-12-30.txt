ACAB520,eknr1u,"It’s a pain to keep it healthy too. Every night I have to do two strand twists, then wrap my hair to keep it from getting single strand knots."
AlarmingSorbet,eknr1u,Yes! I have lupus so some days I have the energy and some days I’m in too much pain and need help just to get to the bathroom. You do what you can with what you got.
Ample-sauce,eknr1u,I keep my hair in protective styles because I prefer to not have to style and maintain on a daily or almost daily basis.
Disturbia8081,eknr1u,I feel this rn. My hair look like crap and is dry so back to a twist out.
DrkWht,eknr1u,I have my hair in twists on most days or a low bun. I only bother with wearing wash n go’s on the weekend
FirstSliceofPi,eknr1u,"I’m feeling it too 😪. My hair is finally past my shoulders and I love that it’s longer, but the upkeep!! It’s so frustrating! Sometimes I just keep it in a bun or a beret for weeks. You look gorgeous, and your curls look so juicy!!!"
Glutton4Glitter,eknr1u,You're not the only one. I end up just wearing my hair in a low bun almost every day just so I don't have to deal with it lol. 2020 goal is to try a little more. You look lovely btw :)
Jeptic,eknr1u,Yup yup yup. Everyone has to pay attention to their hair type though. 4c and 3a have different journeys. I find youtube has been especially helpful in not just health for hair but style advice. Plunk in your hair type and see what's out there.
Khunte99,eknr1u,I put my hair in protective styles 95% of the time because of this... yeah... out here surviving not thriving🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
MinPadThai,eknr1u,"I feel this all the time. When it gets bad, I’ll put my hair into plaits so I can feel less stressed about it"
Shawanna88,eknr1u,Not alone but once you get the hang of things its golden! Good luck on your journey.
SqueakyCog,eknr1u,"I like using a moisturizing cream in order to get that semi-curly look but life is SO much easier once I started to like my hair in its drier state. Afros all day, everyday."
TasteOxygen,eknr1u,"I love my natural hair, but the struggles of keeping it looking good daily; is too much to handle at times. Am I the only one that get stressed out over this?&&&&&&4c and 3a are just basic categories of a bigger plot. There are billions of different 4c and 3a types of hair for example. Your hair is like your fingerprints. No 2 hair patters are alike.&&&I totally feel you and that’s why I am constantly at the barber 🤦🏽‍♀️&&&What a stress OMG&&&Stay strong girl."
favangryblkgirl,eknr1u,You are definitely not alone... my hair is in braids about 98% of the time
kwiyomikat,eknr1u,"/Looks in ""I do my mom's hair.""/"
notgugubela,eknr1u,You’re definitely not alone! Most days my hair is in jumbo braids under a scarf 🤷🏾‍♀️
DamaDeGatos,ekl4k9,"I completed the survey, only to see that the group will be hosted on Instagram, which I don't use. Meh. I hope this develops into a great resource, though!"
HereticalBlackGirl,ekl4k9,This is incredible! I can't wait to see what this will do in the near future! ❤❤ Best of luck~
redefinebeauty,ekl4k9,Join a curly hair focus group&&&[removed]&&&Ofc! Thanks for your help 😊&&&OMG! About to hit 40 responses! thanks everyone!!&&&I think about ideas I’m interested in (typically not related to CS) and figure out how I can use Cs to fill gaps in the market. Huge opportunity in beauty and Hair space where tech is rarely applied. If you wanna chat more dm me 🙂&&&We’ll be actually hosting it on fb. Would that be better for you?
tenoasis,ekl4k9,Wow I’m a computer science graduate. Great idea! How do you come up with ideas for projects? I have so many interests but find it difficult to relate to programming/creating a project
vintagepop,ekl4k9,"I’m excited to try this! Ty for putting the time and effort into it.

Edit: Just tried it and I think it's amazing! I hope I get added into it."
satan_little_helper,ekiyd4,"I think there's two ways to look at this. 

At a certain point, it is a preference. Some people just don't like their hair curly or coily because they think it makes their face look wide, big, etc. Natural hair is just another aspect of wearing your hair. That ""natural"" coily state is no different than wanting your hair to be blue. Societally, yes, but if she think it's fine when other people wear it, but don't like it on her, then I don't really think there's anything wrong with that. 

I'd rather my hair in a puff than an afro. I'd also rather my hair black/its natural colour rather than dyeing the ends, but I do like how it looks on other people. My friend (she is black), on the other hand, likes her hair straight and hates having her hair curly. She just doesn't like how it looks on her, and that's perfectly fine. 

I think summing something down to the racial/societal contexts without also looking at how the person feels is unfair. Yes, some people are impacted by it, but there are also some people that aren't. As long as she's not judging you or anyone else for wearing their hair natural, then that's perfectly fine."
sugarblocks218,ekiyd4,"My friend told me she didn’t feel pretty with her natural hair&&&One of my really good friends relaxed her hair a while back; she had been natural for a year and a half or so. She’s gorgeous regardless, but she said that the main reason she relaxed her hair was that she didn’t feel pretty with her natural hair. It kinda made me sad, because like I said, she gorgeous! She can pull off any look as far as I’m concerned, so it was very surprising to hear her say that. (Disclaimer: she doesn’t think she’s ugly or anything, nor does she think girls who wear their hair natural are ugly. I just felt that it was important to clarify)&&&Oh no! I wasn’t trying to imply that it bothered me. I just thought it was interesting to hear her perspective on it. Sorry 😅"
MadamCookie,ekeap9,I love doing 6 flat twists going back and putting the ends in two little buns with scrunchies. You can decorate them with golden or silver clasps and other accessories!
Zaylyn5355,ekeap9,I do wash and go's ( a mousse/foam works great for me). I pineapple at night and then unpineapple in the morning. Shake and fluff then I'm out the door. Lasting over a week for me but I like to wash my hair once a week
azuredemure,ekeap9,I usually do two flat twists (middle or side part) and either do buns at the end or cris cross them and pin them up.
chocolatequickk,ekeap9,mini twist! they take a while but definitely worth it depending on your hair you can wear them for weeks in a style or if you just want to wear them in a bun. definitely recommend.&&&or passion twists thats what i’m about to put in my hair rn!
cutieangelfish,ekeap9,That sounds super cute! Do you have a picture? I’m trying to do something like this’
fabaquoquevanilla,ekeap9,"you can also do mini loose twists. they're easier on the hands, take less time to do, and they look like loose hair."
queen_jo_,ekeap9,"Cute Protective Styles?&&&can anyone please recommend me cute protective hairstyles to wear so i don’t have to fuss with my hair every day? ones that i can wear for days at a time, and that are actually flattering. tbh i find many to be either/or on me. my braiding sucks but i’ll make it work lol. thanks :-)&&&omg so cute! and sounds doable lol. thank you :-)&&&how do you keep it defined? all my definition only shows when my hair is wet and goes away as soon as i comb it in even a little :/"
rnountdiablo,ekeap9,"I've been doing mini twists in my hair since 2016, everything is way easier"
OrangeIvyy,ekdx9v,I blow dry my hair twice a week and it’s healthy. I sometimes blow dry when wet but I usually blow dry about 24 hours after my hair has been washed and it’s dry. I wouldn’t worry about heat damage through blow drying. Blow on warm heat and inspect your hair thoroughly each time after washing for heat damage.
Zaylyn5355,ekdx9v,Have you thought of a no heat stretch? Why are you blow drying your hair?
britt151,ekdx9v,"Not sure if this helps but I heard that blow drying wet hair actually is very damaging as it sucks all the moister out. I blow dry my hair pretty often and now I wash the first day, section hair into 4 ponytails and braid it with heat protectant, sleep and blow dry the next day. It may help with the damage you’re experiencing. Do you add a lot of product? Could that be why your scalp feels like it needs to be washed? Maybe add peppermint essential oil to your shampoo? It makes my scalp feel really cool and fresh even days after washing. Good luck with your blow drying regimen!"
tauruspiscescancer,ekdx9v,"Blow drying regimen for natural hair?&&&Hi everyone! 

Does anyone here follow a blow-dry regimen for their natural hair? I’m trying to decide whether or not I want to full commit to having one. 

At face value, my hair is a mix of 4b and 4c strands, with some random 4a at the back of my head. My hair is low-porosity and suffers greatly from fairy knots (or single-strand knots). I’ve always found that when I get my hair professionally straightened, the knots practically disappear from my hair. In addition, my hair seems to retain moisture better in a heat-stretched state. However, after suffering from heat damage almost a year and a half ago, I am scared to be tackling my hair with heat consistently in fear of reoccurring heat damage. 

I washed a blow-dried my hair about 2 weeks ago and currently, my scalp is screaming to be washed again. Is blow-drying every 2 weeks too often? Should I go into protective styling mode after this wash? 

Can anyone give me tips on how I can approach this or if you are a blow-dry natural, how does yours regimen look?&&&okay thanks for this advice!&&&I do add lots of product, but only to my strands and only on wash day. Throughout the week, I try to use light oils and maybe just water to keep my hair moisturized because I am prone to product buildup. 

I have a shampoo that has peppermint, eucalyptus, and tea tree oil in it that I love! But I’ve discovered that my scalp needs to be cleaned every 2 weeks because that’s when I start getting really bad dandruff and dryness on my scalp.&&&My hair doesn’t quite like heatless stretching. It still finds a way to knot and tangle even after thoroughly detangling. This is because I have very tight curls. When I use heat, my straighter strands have less opportunity to tangle and knot."
saucy_pudding,ekdx73,"Anyone know where I can get this product?&&&Product: 

Dark and Lovely Healthy Gloss 5 Moisture Hair Creme with Satin Oil


This has been the only product to keep my hair from drying out overnight or when in harsh conditions. And make it manageable period. 

I'm pretty sure the company discontinued the 6 oz size cuz I can only get it if I buy the perm. Ugh!

My hope was that someone here might know of a site that is still selling leftover stock. (I've already checked Amazon and Ebay.)

I still see the original Sunsilk being sold at insane prices by people on ebay. So, I thought just maybe I could find this product."
Ashleyjasmine,ek7yij,You can use a good old plastic bag
CoffeeB4Talkie,ek7yij,"No. I don't own a heat cap. 

I apply my DC, put on my conditioning cap, put my hair turban towel over that, then put a bonnet on over that. 

Then I let my scalps natural heat do it's thing."
ElectricWordLife,ek7yij,You could also throw a towel in the dryer for a minute. Then put on a plastic cap and wrap your head withe the warmed towel.
LoveBeauty24,ek7yij,"I think it is helpful, especially in the winter months when the air is cold... I find that heat caps help the conditioner penetrate better into my hair. If it’s possible, I would get one."
Syuba_Kagate,ek7yij,Yes i use the hot head deep conditioning cap
haireveryshare,ek7yij,"Heat helps, I find that the heat from my head is plenty if it is wrapped and insulated well.  

Natural Heat from the head is why wrapping your straight/stretched hair at night smooths it and adds shine, it’s not just the flatness but flatness+heat."
myvibeiztremendous,ek7yij,"No. You can apply the conditioner or mask and put on a shower cap. Then wrap a dry towel or headwrap around your head and proceed about business as usual for however long you want. Once you are ready to rinse it out, remove all layers and rinse. 

You could also double up on your shower caps/plastic bags and take a hot shower. The steam from your head & the shower will have the same effect."
xRA05,ek7yij,"Quick question- Do you have to use a heat cap when you deep condition, because I bought a deep conditioner and it says leave it in heat and I don't own one?&&&&&&Alright, how much do they usually cost?&&&Lol I'll probably give that a go for now&&&Okay I'll definitely try it, thanks"
Gridza,ek6p2s,How can you fight the dryness of natural 4C Hair&&&
Blergh_MaGerks,ek18ct,"My hair is a lot like yours. It's shoulder length, with bangs like yours, and I'm currently growing it longer. I trim and shape mine myself. I only do wash n gos (any tension on my scalp = migraine).

I wash my hair with Curlsmith conditioning wash, and style with their oil-in-cream and their curl souffle. Then I sit under my hooded dryer (you can get them for less than a fancy hand held dryer, like $88 at Sally's). My entire shower, style and set takes an hour. Also be sure to have good shears on hand. Not crappy scissors. Shears hold the hair in place and cut quickly, anything dull will damage your ends and make them prone to splitting.

After my curls are set how I like them, I'll trim them. I do not stretch or pull at them before cutting. That helps me guarantee that they'll lay how I want when it's styled. Even if I decide to stretch my curls after the fact, they'll maintain the overall shape I cut in the first place.

I hope this helps!

Tl;Dr: cut it after you style it to make sure the curls sit how you like them."
Onelittleleaf,ek18ct,I would say have your hair cut while it's dry. Cut curl by curl in certain spots.
Peanut0131,ek18ct,I use bobby pins too put it at the length I want.
WhildChild,ek18ct,I don’t have advice but girl them lashes though!!! 💕
campbelly_,ek18ct,"No advice sorry, but ur curlsss be popping ‼️"
fivetenash,ek18ct,"Seriously, please tell us about those lashes!"
iknowke,ek18ct,Fingercoils help for me. The different curl patterns are not so glaring then. But I do large ones then separate when dry otherwise detangling is a headache after smaller ones.
mumbojumbocandy,ek18ct,"Hey guys! Does anyone have any advice on hair cutting/styling? The curls in the front of my head are at that 4a area while my crown is 4b with some looser curls in the back. Due to my different curl pattern it makes it look like my hair is different lengths, how do I counteract that?&&&&&&Haha thanks! These are actually dollar tree accent lashes for like 4 dollars! They’re great for a college girl like me on a budget 😂&&&Thank you!! I’ll try this the next time I do a wash and go, I’ll also have to buy that dryer&&&They’re the ardell accent lashes!"
sugarwater28,ek18ct,"I would say go to a deva curl place or somewhere where they specialize in cutting curly hair dry. I also have like three different curl patterns and for the first time in my life, my hair finally all appears to be one length after I went to a place hat specialized in curly hair. Good luck!"
ElectricWordLife,ejzs2j,"It might be the way you are blowdrying it. If you are combing or brushing while drying,  you might be over manipulating it and causing split ends.

I have 4b/c hair that is a few inches below waist length.  I keep it stretched to avoid single strand knots too.

I blow dry it by rolling it in large rollers and drying it on cool with a bonnet dryer. I don't use a comb or brush because they are too rough on my hair. I just comb it carefully with my fingers before rolling it.  I think it helps to protect my ends and prevent split ends.

I also go through my hair and cut off individual split ends when I find them so they don't get out of control.

Edit: This wasn't completely without heat, but if you want, you can also just let the rollers air dry."
flplyr200,ejzs2j,"Trying to find a compromise between single strand knots and split ends&&&I have 4c hair that seems to be prone to both split ends and single strand knots. I’ve found that when I blow dry after washing (making sure my ends are straight) my hair is much easier to detangle and I have less single strand knots because my ends aren’t getting caught on each other. 

I feel like the heat and blow drying process might be contributing to split ends. I usually have box braids but lately I have been braiding/ twisting my own hair without extensions, so I don’t blow dry super often, probably 2 weeks to two months between each blow dry depending on what style I have in. Does anyone have a similar problem/ tips for how to keep my ends from tangling without heat?"
haireveryshare,ejzs2j,"I have long, fine, very dense type 3 hair, Which I think is similar difficulty level to, at least shorter or mid length type 4 hair.  because of the total number of curls x statistical opportunity for tangles & dry ends. 

I have absolutely gone the way of stretching and avoiding single strand knots.  I also constantly trim any splits I see.  I also keep it stretched for 2-5weeks.

Personally I think knots are more damaging because they involved multiple hairs, usually daily or every other day, and they tear the hair high up.  Whereas splits at the ends can/will get trimmed. 
 
I eventually got my hair blunt and it makes monitoring the ends for splits easy."
Subparwoman,ejpghv,"Personally, I would do shampoo > rinse > hair masque > rinse > leave in > curling cream > coconut oil. Some people have found that switching the order of the cream and oil works better for them so you'll have to experiment."
xRA05,ejpghv,"What do I do after shampooing my hair.&&& Hello guys, my products just arrived today. I got Shea Moisture JBCO hair masque  (deep conditioner), Shea Moisture leave in conditioner, Cantu curling cream and some coconut oil. What should put in order after shampooing, and are there any more products  I need?&&&Appreciate the quick reply. So is that LCO? I heard LCO is better than LOC&&&And how long do I leave the masque in. I'm not using any heat btw"

Cressi,ejge4d,"Progress after close to four years of being natural&&&&&&I honestly don't really have one. I'm guilty of neglecting my hair more often than not. Lately I have been trying to take better care of it though. 

The closest thing I have to a routine at the moment is: I use Tresemee shampoo and conditioner every two weeks. After washing my hair I split it into 6-8 sections and detangle each one with a wide tooth comb. I apply the LottaBody cream moisturizer and rub it in then add Africa's Best Herbal Oil to it and plait it up. When all the sections are done I let my hair air dry for a while and when I'm ready for bed I tie it down with a scarf. I only use heat on my hair maybe once or twice a year."
lcamp2006,ejge4d,What is your hair care routine&&&Ok I have to get a semi routine because I been doing natural for a little over a yr and my hair is shedding really bad
Jayeky,ejg9is,Prob 2 years
bazboozled,ejg9is,How long do you think it would take to grow my hair to this length with my hair currently at 2.5-3 inches rn?&&&
haireveryshare,ejg9is,"1.5 to 2 years

this are great styles.  Good reference for the guys asking for new male style ideas."

pearbear22,ejfcsc,I am in love with your hair!!!! It’s the curls I always wanted.
sugarwater28,ejfcsc,After years of pretending to have short hair in the mirror (with Bobby pins and clips) I finally just cut my hair and I love the new me 💕&&&&&&I always thought my hair was too curly to look good short and was always too embarrassed to go into a salon and ask for a curly hairstyle (as opposed to getting a blow out) but I left the salon feeling like a Princess after getting this cut! ☺️&&&Thank you!!&&&Oh you’re sweet! 😊&&&I’m in love with it too!!! And tbh I never even knew I had these curls lol ☺️&&&Ikr and thank you! I really didn’t think it’d suit me so I said whatever and finally cut it (:&&&Thank you!
