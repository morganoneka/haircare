doots,e19b4y,Killin' it
melissafaith,e19b4y,Love it! My mom used to do my hair like that when I was a kid and I always found myself making sure to tun my head/ sway so that the beads would clack lmaooo it got me into trouble at times
visolana7,e19b4y,I put in some simple braids as a protective style and added some cute beads ♥️ (my 1st time ever wearing beads in my hair)&&&&&&I'm clacking all over the place 😂 so much fun&&&Thank you doll
BLACMAJIC26,e1889g,"Help! Best gel available in Aussie stores&&&Not sure if there are many Aussies in here but is someone able to suggest a good hair gel? I tried Eco Styler Gel which I love but it cost me $20 and I really don’t want to spend that much again 🤦🏾‍♀️ I also tried using the one by John Frieda and it left my hair feeling very tacky. 
(I don’t mind if I have to order online. It seems a lot of curly hair products here are only available online.)"
511lonette,e17h3z,You sure did!  Lovely!
Mynotredditaccount,e17h3z,"I had a good fro day and wanted to share! 😁&&&&&&Awww! You're so sweet! Thank you very much you lovely human 🥰&&&Thank you! Crazy thing is, I didn't even do anything particularly special it lol&&&It's all about picking and shaping with your hands. I also dusted my ends a few weeks ago. You can't tell from the picture but my hair is not as even as I would like it to be 😅&&&Thanks! 🥰🥰🥰"
imnotajeep,e17h3z,Why don’t my fros ever look neat and shapely?
ineverhadyourbabytom,e17h3z,Good fro AND good looking I see you sis!
sqwzmahmeatybts,e17h3z,"You've blessed me, and I am grateful. Thank your gorgeous!!"
CoffeeB4Talkie,e15e3y,"Shea Moisture products. The exception is the Manuka Honey and Yogurt protein treatment. - I tried so many of their lines and my hair did not like it. Even when they seemed to work, I realized I had so much build up."
Enfpization,e15e3y,"Which product do you HATE and why?&&&Hello my natural sisters! 

I just wondered which product you really really hated and why you hate it so much! Why it seemed so magical at first and you had been so disappointed afterwards? 

Tell us about the product you won't recommend, ever!  😄&&&I didn't expect to see Cantu here lol, what kind of porosity do you have ?&&&How much did you spent on those? Because I know Shea Moisture is quite expensive 🧐&&&Hey I was about to buy this product there is so much good reviews about it so I'm quite surprised. Which one do you use instead?"
Syuba_Kagate,e15e3y,"The sheamoisture raw shea butter masque is awful. It made my hair tangle, i love their JBCO and Manuka Honey masques though."
boopalooo,e15e3y,"I’ve had SEVERAL. These are the only ones I can think of right off the bat. 
* The Mane Choice Heavenly Oil + Lotion moisturizer thing. It felt really gross on my hair and refused to cooperate with gel. I mean I guess oil and gel doesn’t mix but the results were horrid. 
* The Mane Choice Biotin edge control and gel for curls: it flaked they fuck up. Soooo much. 
* Shea Moisture line that’s red? I don’t remember it’s name but the main purpose was to elongate curls and everything. It didn’t do anything at all for my hair, didn’t have good slip and didn’t define or elongate anything at all."
brainsweeties,e15e3y,"Eden Coconut Oil Deep Conditioner, well I think it was the coconut one. Turns my hair into a rats nest every time."
iridescentleandra,e15e3y,The Cantu leave in conditioner. I used it because I was being cheap but finally went back to shea moistures JBCO leave in. the Cantu leave in has glycerin in its first 5 or so ingredients and I realized it's not great for my hair at all.&&&I hate it! it made my hair soft but immediately put it into moisture overload because there was no protein in it
DeeDee2015,e11tal,"3"" is certainly long enough for cornrows. Twists work as well. Make sure you deep condition and moisturize to minimize breakage."
UrDadsFave,e11tal,"Twists  or braids. Same styles that work for women work for men. A lot of basketball players are doing protective styles.  Trevor Ariza (although I think he's starting locs so of course you would take yours down every couple weeks), Westbrook (before he big chopped a couple weeks ago)."
chocolatequickk,e11tal,mini twist
montero19,e11tal,Are their any protective hairstyles that I (M) can do to prevent breakage and get hair retention?&&&My hair is currently 2-3” and i don’t want to pick out my hair everyday because I heard low maintenance is best. And i feel like I’m loosing a lot of hair because of it. Also what are better ways to keep my hair From matting but not build up. (Low porosity) i have a video if anyone wants to see
UrDadsFave,e10qa2,"Too close. I just came in to say keep you some cute ass scarves for when the experiments leave you looking like Angelica's doll Cynthia.  So many days I took my lil knots and twists down just to look in the mirror like, ""soooooo I can't call out of work today so they gonna get this scarf today.""🤣"
WhildChild,e10qa2,When my hair was shorter I had to do more Bantu knots for them to cooperate. To be honest even with armpit length hair now 2 Bantu knots wouldn’t work for me. Lol. I also have a big head though sooo…
blakppuch,e10qa2,Tried doing Bantu knots...it looks more like Shrek baby’s ears lol 😬. Also one side is gel’d and flaking 😅 The struggle is real.&&&&&&😂😂&&&Haha lol no I do not do YouTube.
byyouiamundone,e10qa2,UNRELATED BUT my sister is convinced  she “knows you” because of this picture 😂 Do you make YouTube videos?
npbm2008,e10qa2,"Yeah, when I want two sections, that’s when afro puffs work. 

Bantu knots mean lots and lots of sections for me."
onlysolsol,e10qa2,"This hits too close to home, my condolences 😔"
montero19,e0y4w2,Are there any protective styles that i can do at this point that won’t stress my hair? If not what length can i start to. Currently 2-3 inches&&&
Schapman90,e0tzwr,How I hydrate my Afro&&&
AdamantiumFoil,e0tk9i,"I'd like to start with saying that shrinkage is a good thing! Only healthy hair keeps your natural curl pattern tight, so congrats on that!

I have had luck with stretching wash and gos by banding the top 2 inches or so, or twisting or braiding the two inches closest to my scalp (how well that blends will depend on your curl pattern). Stretching is really the only way to get a bit more length out of it. I tend to always wear my hair in twists or twist-outs, and it has the added bonus of stretched hair being easier to detangle..."
AngieGoesWest,e0tk9i,"Any suggestions&&&I have had my hair natural for 6+ years now and it seems to always struggle with shrinkage especially in the back of my head. It’s like my hair will never go past the top of my shoulders but is definitely longer than that. It’s a bit annoying, and am really not sure what to do at this moment. Open to suggestions, do others have the same issue?&&&Yeah, I feel like my hair is just so weird at times. I see all of these amazing videos/pictures of curls and I’m like there is not way my hair is doing that or even the next day is going to look like that. I don’t like adding too much product to my hair as is. More like leave in conditioner and water. I don’t wash it as often, every 4-5 days sometimes more. Struggles."
PigmentedLady,e0s5wp,"Both. 

I can emphasize, because it's not implanted in young afro women on how to maintain thick, coarse to fine, hair. However I would look at it from a health standpoint and not from a ""I don't want to do this."" ""This is too much, I'm going back to perms..."" standpoint. 


I can't give any advise because I grew up with my natural hair. My mom made sure I loved it. I remember asking for a perm just because I was following the crowd. She preached and lectured me about my hair lol and so I never gave up. 

But I can say, I have long hair but I also have thick, coarse, dense, and multi textured hair. Most women would say it looks good, and they want my length or whatever. But in reality if that was to happen they'd kill it and shorten the growth, if they were to have my hair. My hair is hard work to others. So I always try to make sure I tell a woman be grateful with what you have. 

It's rare to see women with my hair structure but when I do... I'll sympathize and emphasize even more."
PinkMelaunin,e0s5wp,If they're rlly used to that lifestyle then I wouldn't blame them. Life is hard and natural hair is harder.
SleepieSheepie8,e0s5wp,"I think you could understand if you’ve ever spent a whole 24 hours doing your hair. Washing it, Detangling it, Deep Conditioning it, Styling it, Waiting for it to dry AND THEN do that every week for the rest of your natural life....

Oh? You want to straighten it? Change it up a bit?WAIT THERE’S MORE. You have to Clarify and strip your hair so you get your hair squeaky clean!😊...

Wait, did you say strip your hair? HAHA! You now have to put that moisture back into your hair by Deep Conditioning! And we all know how long that take, hey hey!😊 Cool! Now that that’s done, I’ll just straighten my hair. 

GIRL HOLD IT. You’ll damage your hair that way! You have to BLOW-DRY your futhermuckin’ hair hunney! And don’t forget to use HEAT PROTECTANT because you’ll be bald-headed tomorrow if not.😊

... Finally... I straightened my hair... I think it looks really nice :)....

Sweetheart... you need a futhermuckin’ TRIM. CUT THOSE DEAD ENDS OFF. Then you’ll proceed to cut off all 2 inches of hair growth you’ve experienced in the last 3 years.😊

There you have it Ladies and Gentleman... natural hair. Don’t want to be doing all that? Understandable. Do you hunney."
haireveryshare,e0s5wp,"None.  I cut off my relaxed ends in my bathroom 17 years ago, wavered now and then thinking straight hair was prettier.  Went through my twenties and didn’t so much as blow dry for a 7 year stretch because social politics.  Now I straighten for a few weeks at a time multiple times a year AND my hair is the healthiest it’s ever been.  

I enjoy my hair straightened now and then because I like long hair- it looks longer straight & because it is fairly long it is a major break from detangling.   I don’t even like the flatness or straight hair, it’s boring.  My ideal hair would be my natural texture, long and self washing ;) I do me and let’s others do themselves."
hellokimm,e0s5wp,I would just assume their arms were tired
riri87,e0s5wp,"You do you! As long as your hair is healthy and happy, there is nothing wrong with straightening your hair! The natural journey can be taxing and hard on people!"
ticia-mori,e0s5wp,"What would be your judgement on someone who's got back on straightening?&&&Basically, what do you think about people who give up on natural hair? Are they still blinded by European standards or is it just how they feel better?&&&It's just that as a Brazilian woman things are a bit different culturally speaking. Here we do what could be called perm but maybe Brazilian straightening for you. which means there's no turning back. I have 3a/3b curls and sometimes I think about getting it permanently straight again because my life's so crazy that I don't have time to wear my hair the way a want to. Also, people say that natural hair is easier than straightening it, like: just wash and go. Noooo bitch m it doesn't work that way. The Truth is that a fear judgment even though I know I shouldn't."
Nrvanaaa,e0mry2,No way to know from just this pic...maybe look up natural hair Youtubers and compare
otherboyy,e0mry2,Can anyone tell me my hair type please?&&&
trevinia,e0mry2,Maybe 3b or 3c
Brinaken,e0gza7,"Your hair journey is cool, nice curls. stay with it."
HotCacao,e0gza7,"Curls looking righteous.
Also- you are soo pretty"
Voodoochiiild11,e0gza7,So beautiful!
annonimusone,e0gza7,What did you do differently?
bemusingmusings,e0gza7,Seconded
keepingholdtillmay,e0gza7,"Can you drop your hair routine? Lol, my hair is stuck in the awkward phase and stopped growing."
quality-bun,e0gza7,"February 2019 vs November 2019!!&&&&&&Thank you!!&&&Thank you!!&&&Thanks !&&&Honestly nothing I just left it alone and moisturized it ! My hair was just super super dry back then all it needed was like...water 😭&&&Sure though y’know everyone’s different 

But rn it’s basically just weekly or once every other week I wash with a cowash (asiam coconut cowash) and deep condition (TGIN honey miracle + olive oil) and I section it off into 6 and stretch them using the banding method and go to bed. then the next day I do mini twists on the dry hair using aunt Jackie’s quench, asiam double butter, and aunt Jackie’s don’t shrink and that’ll last me 1-2 weeks depending on if I decide I care about frizz. That and a lot of headscarves."
Myaxmyax,e0g6d6,"Need some hair ideas&&&Soooo I have fine curly hair. My curls are loose like in between 3a/3b. I’m trying to find more protective styles, and I’m really struggling to do so. I have a bad habit of washing my hair three times a week because it can get oily, and I’m trying to break out of that habit. I recently got braids for the first time, and fell in love but experienced a bunch of hair loss. Any ideas are greatly appreciated!!"
quality-bun,e0g6d6,Mini twists are my favorite because they look good with minimal manipulation
