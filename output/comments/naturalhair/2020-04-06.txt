Determined2Succeed,g06v90,"Help Me Grow My Super Fine Hair&&&My hair is extremely fine, and it’s been thinning since I have issues with my hormones. I also lost my super wavy and curly hair texture. What can I do to lengthen my hair and add volume? I literally can’t do anything with it except for throw it on top of my head because I don’t have enough hair anymore."
azuredemure,g06v90,Rice water helps hair grow. Biotin helps too.

AsiaTheRuler,g00qh0,"I put oil on my scalp and around the top everytime I wash my hair, followed by a leave in. Every day between washes I retouch with leave in and oil again. I know oil just seals, but I feel like out hair type can get really tangled and break very easily, especially if its dry. I feel like the oil helps to keep it less tangled. If my hair feels too greasy or frizzy I wrap it up for they day so I'm not touching it and breaking it."
BasicBrownQueen,g00qh0,Gosh my hair does exactly this!!! If anyone has solutions please post more of them. The part at the top- middle of my hair is always a little frizzy the second day after washing.
DreadfulLove,g00qh0,"Your hair looks so much like mine I had to scroll up to see if I had posted on here and forgot about it!

I’m currently trying to find out the same answer to your question for myself. My gf gave me the idea to apply all my products while in the shower and hair drenched so that it doesn’t even begin to dry without all your resources already in it. I’m going to try on my next wash. Good luck"
haireveryshare,g00qh0,"Yes, it’s totally normal.  Even people with straight or wavy hair have somewhat curlier and more brittle hair at the crown.  Behind the ears also, in my observations.

I have given up trying to keep it as healthy as the rest, but I do basically treat it like ends, extra CO."
kamicami,g00qh0,"3c hair ladies, do you ever experience extremely dry/weak hair around the top-middle of your head? How do you keep it moisturized throughout the day?&&&"
peachesandlily,g00qh0,"Coconut oil has really helped me, I also have 3c hair and very dry skin/dry scalp. I’ve been massaging the oil into my scalp, really focusing on the top of my head as that’s where my skin and hair seem to be the driest. It’s made a huge difference, I do it every three days, no more dandruff and no more frizz.

I’ve heard horror stories too though about coconut oil, so it doesn’t work for everyone. But if you have dry skin/hair it’s worth a shot!"
silenceherr,g00qh0,"You’re probably gonna have to deep condition, or do a moisturizing hair mask and allow that moisture to penetrate your hair for a good minute before you wash it out. Ofcourse it’s not a one time thing but if you’re consistent, you will see progress."
angelD0ve,fzydos,"Trimming Ends&&&I have low porosity hair, not really sure what my hair type is though (i.e. 3a). I haven’t had a trim in quite some time, maybe like a year. It’s evident I need a trim and I have attempted to start to trim my ends using the two strand twist method but I am concerned because when I trim what I think I should be trimming it’s like my hair goes flat, dead, or straight at the end of the shaft. Is this normal? Am I trimming too much or not enough? Also, my two strand twist are a bit frizzy. I only used leave in conditioner because I was going to style it after my trim and that’s when I will add my oil. Is that frizziness due to no oil or is that an implication of further damage? 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated."
EastMetal,fzm0py,"I have a mix of 3b/3c/4a curls and been natural for around seven years (ish). For reference, I cut my hair to just below my ears about 4 years ago and it is now just above my belly button. I've tried the CGM, using sulfates/silicones, using only natural products, etc, etc, etc. and the only thing that seems to work for me is looking my hair at its most natural state and then learning what it is lacking. I only deep condition if I feel like my hair needs it, and with that, I have a deep conditioner for when I think my hair needs a boost of moisture and another one for if it needs protein. 

I also only used to shampoo my hair once per week, but noticed that my hair and scalp actually liked it when I shampooed more often. I now wash my hair whenever I think it needs a good wash.

I also started cutting my own hair a few years ago, since I live in NYC and curly haircuts are so damn expensive. Because of this, I am now able to cut any pieces that seem frayed, which has really helped with my growth.

Since you're stuck at home anyways, this is a wonderful time to get to know your hair and what it needs/is lacking. There are some wonderful YouTube videos and blogs that can help you understand what hair that needs moisture/protein looks like.

One thing that I can say has DEFINITELY shown me more growth, though, is using a shampoo brush. I got mine from Sephora for about $10 and use it on my scalp whenever I shampoo my hair, I bet you can find one on Amazon too, though. Best of luck on your curly journey!"
Timbo2010,fzm0py,"Is the best way to grow your hair weekly deep conditioning?&&&Hello!

I’m focusing on my hair regimen during the Rona virus quarantine. 

Do you guys follow the weekly deep conditioning regimen? 

I’ve heard weekly deep conditioning. Shampoo once a week. Cowash to refresh. 

Right now I’m using curl smith/TGIN. I’m mostly a 4b/4a. 

Getting away from using eco right now since it dries my hair tf out lol

Natural 2.5 years. 1 year I used protective styles for length.&&&Thank you for this! I’m going to play around with cowash 1x and shampoo 1x! I think this Rona is a great time. I’m also trying to get used to my wash and go regimen."
HersheyKissesPooh,fzlf8e,Looks good
IIBVGBXRTHV,fzlf8e,I tried a rope two strand twist & styled them myself. Then cut my own hair with a wahl clipper kit. Not bad for it only being my second time cutting my hair lol. What y’all think?🙂&&&&&&Thank youuuu :)
Mspixel,fzlf8e,That looks really good :)
MuffinPuff,fzlf8e,Good job sis

Liyahloo,fzl9w2,"Spontaneously cut 4 inches off of my hair after years of straightening due to insecurities💪🏾. I am not sure of my hair type and if there is a way a can keep the curls I have when my hair is wet? Any help will be appreciated ☺️&&&&&&I use the Shea moisture curl pudding, but I don't think it's right for my texture, it leaves my hair overly sticky&&&I comb it in through my fingers.  My hairs very poros though so it tends to eat up product and I end up wasting money.

I'll deffo try the scrunch thing, thanks 🥰I tend to pull my hair into a high ponytail after washing so it doesn't drip everywhere and add product after its dried a bit but that doesn't help my definition 😭"
SugarsDimples,fzl9w2,Have you tried or considered curl defining or boosting styling products?
knbubba,fzl9w2,"Also I got some mouse for curly hair from the beauty supply store and after I put product in I do the upside down scrunch thing in my hair and I think it does a good job of keeping my curl pattern similar to when wet.

Also the way you apply product has a lot bigger impact than one would think on how your hair looks when dry. How do you apply yours ?"
AnalTattoo,fzbz5u,I wish I'd stayed natural my entire life! Dark & Lovely ruined me for years.
Art-And-Ether,fzbz5u,"Here is a little length check💕. This is blow dried hair and I've been natural my whole life(20yrs)&&&&&&Yeah my mom was a hair stylist and after administering a lot of relaxers she wanted her children to have completely natural hair👏&&&Yeah if you find a good routine and stick with it your hair will flourish! Good luck on your Growth Journey 💖&&&Thank you! I got to this length by just packing on the moisturizers, I wear a lot of head wraps too."
ibelieveintadcooper,fzbz5u,I’m so jealous. I’ve just started growing my hair out a few months ago and it has a long ways to go.
minicyrie,fzbz5u,Looks nice!! Been natural my entire life as well... but my hair is not that long haha
Dylanspencer13,fza36y,Also give onion juice a try. GreenBeauty on YouTube has a great recipe.
Lukasmom,fza36y,I've heard rice water works?
lapsrrodgers,fza36y,"Anyone ever salvage edges before?&&&My edges were already thin, but, since the quarantine, I neglected my hair for a few weeks and now they're even worse (mainly the left side). And I mean nearly balding. Is it too late?&&&Thank you&&&Thank you!"
tiffanyliv,fz75pp,"leave in recommendations?&&&I’ve been using the shea moisture black castor oil leave in for the past few weeks and even though it moisturizes my hair, i always have to do the LCO method the next day. I have normal to high porosity hair and the leave in is very water based. Should I get something thicker? I’m content with what I have right now, but it is a little annoying that I have to do the LCO method daily or twice a day to keep my hair moisturized."
pinpanponko,fz73xm,"Transitioning hair is when you grow out your natural hair without relaxing/pressing/heating it in order to grow healthy curls. About every month, people who are transitioning will trim 1/8-1/2 an inch of hair. Doing this is to avoid a ""big chop""-- usually so that you can have long hair while transitioning to natural instead of shaving/cutting most of it and growing it out.   


I highly highly highly recommend doing your box braids yourself (or the much easier two-strand twists). If I'm honest, most hairdressers are not gentle with other people's heads and don't respond well to feedback about being gentle. You don't want tension alopecia and the best way to get a protective style that isn't hurting your scalp and is just right for you is to do it on yourself.  


You're gonna wanna learn about the wash-and-go, two-strand twists, and test out a LOT of products during this process. Wigs, weaves, and extensions are also good protective styles. I hope this helped a bit?"
toppingoffabadnigh2,fz73xm,"Help for Very Damaged Hair?&&&My hair is pretty damaged at the moment, mostly from heat damage and pulling when I was young. There's a lot of breakage in the front and in the back, mainly from all the buns I used to do. My mom never really taught me how to care for my natural hair because I've operated on routine silk presses for years. I'm sure I've encountered heat damage from that or bad hair care on my mom's part and thus my own in the past. So yeah, heat damage and breakage leave me with virtually no healthy hair. I would love just to shave it but my all knowing mom forbade me until I'm 18 which is only in a few months. Recently however I got my second set of box braids ever in my life and they were really tight but my mom once again knowing all told me it'll be fine and loosen up eventually. It didn't however so now I'm using a specific shampoo and ointment to reduce pain and crap but it has genuinely scared me. I've pulled in the past and I have a compulsion to touch and manipulate my hair a lot so I'm scared my hair won't grow so shaving's, in the meantime, is off the table. I want to transition and have watched a few videos but I'm still mostly in the dark... any tips and pointers or am I out of luck?&&&This helped so much! I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to caring for my hair so anything really helps. Thank you so much!"
themomfriendofthemom,fz6r24,It causes really bad break outs for a lot of people. I can only use it when deep conditioning
tiffanyliv,fz6r24,"“problem” with coconut oil&&&For those that don’t like coconut oil, is it because of your hair porosity type? I’ve seen a lot of people say it’s not for them, but it seems to work for me and I have normal/high porosity hair.&&&Do you use it in a diy deep conditioner?"
Kcvexo,fz5rau,"Anywhere from 2days-2weeks. 

1 week usually though."
rose-wilson,fz5rau,Installation time&&&How long have you personally waited to install braids/twists after taking them down?
