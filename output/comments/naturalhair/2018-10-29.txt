BigTittiedMathBitch,9u5znp,"Your diet is also an important factor, do some google searches to see what foods are best for hair growth and make sure you‚Äôre drinking enough water daily. "
Moya1509,9u5znp,"If you have hair on your head it is growing. Hair has life cycles, so it isn‚Äôt possible for it to just not grow for its entire life cycle, unless it is falling out. You said your hair is thick so it is probably not falling out. 

The only logical explanation is breakage.  Either from lack of moisturizing, you are going too long without washing your scalp ( product buildup can cause breakage), you are Not trimming (hair is splitting all the way up to roots and causing hair to break off), you have breakage from coloring your hair, lack of moisturizing/conditioning while the protective styles are in, leaving protective styles in too long. or rough handling when your natural hair is out. "
alienvomit,9u5znp,"I hope what I'm about to say helps, I had a protective style catastrophe 2 years sgo

My sister gave me Goddess Breads last year. Tenderheaded. Eventually, I took them out and the breakage on my hair was extremely bad. Not only that, my hair kept falling out.

I did my research and found some products;

Palmer's Root Spray, Hair Lotion, Shampoo and Conditioner. /That healed the problem.

Maintenance, I invested in oils; Vitamin E, Coconut, Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Olive Oil. I applied these to my scalp and edges as much as I felt necessary.

Now I use: Shea Moisture Shampoo & Conditioner, Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Palmer's Olive Oil Gro Therapy. 

Now my hair is extra moisturized (I wash once a month), healthy and growing. 

Also, let your hair breathe. Have a couple days to a week where you just wear it out. "
bbcreampapapa,9u5znp,"It could be that you‚Äôre not washing it enough. At one point I was protective styling with wigs for almost a whole year but I was shampooing and deep conditioning weekly. I experienced a ton of hair growth, "
evolasaj,9u5znp,"I keep my hair in protective styling basically year round & I haven‚Äôt seen any growth.&&&I‚Äôve got 4B/C hair (the B exists in the very back for some reason). I keep it in box braids or crochets maybe 75% or the time, and the rest of the time I‚Äôm a natural gal. A big puff, two cornrows or a twist out is my go to.

My hair is pretty full & thick but it isn‚Äôt crazy long and I‚Äôve noticed over the past 3-4 years that I haven‚Äôt seen any increase in length (it‚Äôs about shoulder length when straight). When I was young, like less than 10, I developed alopecia & the majority of my hair fell out. It did grow back really nicely but my mom thinks it never regained its full form (I‚Äôm 24 now). 

In terms of maintenance, I keep my scalp oiled. I use tea tree, either diluted with water as a spray (daily, or directly on my scalp (twice a week). I wash it maybe every 4-5 weeks using my natural hair routine (double shampoo, hot oil treatment & deep condition under the dryer). When I take my braids down, I moisturize & detangle. 

I have a couple theories surrounding my lack of growth but I wanted some insight as to why my hair won‚Äôt grow & any suggestions on how to remedy this. I do believe the alopecia played a role. I also colored my hair (before I went natural) and wore it like that for a few months. Lastly, I don‚Äôt use human/high quality hair in my protective styles. Since I keep braids in, I generally buy synthetic braiding hair - nothing fancy. But I‚Äôm wondering if this has anything to do with my no/slow growth. 

All feedback is appreciated. Thanks for reading!&&&The thing is, I don‚Äôt see breakage. When I take my protective styles out, the amount of hair that comes out isn‚Äôt alarming.

Yes, I typically wash every 4-5 weeks to do my whole routine, including deep condition. &&&Did you feel like your styles lasted shorter since you washed it? Like braids tend to frizz up in a shorter amount of time when you‚Äôre constantly in them. &&&I drink a ton of water but I didn‚Äôt consider diet. Thanks! &&&I was gonna respond to you after I had bought said products. I‚Äôve got coconut, tea tree & castor oil. 

I currently use Shea moisture shrinkage reduction because I didn‚Äôt like how the castle oil line made my hair feel. 

I think I‚Äôll try to incorporate them more into my protective styles routine as well. "
omojos,9u5znp,"How much breakage are you seeing?

Are you waiting 4-5 weeks to wash your hair or just to shampoo? What kind of moisturizer are you using after you wash? Do you o LT deep condition after shampooing every 5 weeks or do you regularly condition.

Your hair could be extremely dry if it goes 4-5 weeks without any real moisture."
ChocolateGlamazon27,9u5n76,"I'd actually suggest you go away from IG. There is a lot of competition right now for natural hair pages on Instagram making it hard to stand out from the crowd. 

Create your website first, invest in Facebook groups + Twitter, use Instagram as a natural hair mood board. People are more likely to buy off the bat from ecommerce compared to just a natural hair page. 

It's more professional this way. Good luck!"

Dr_Feeble,9tyvhf,"I do sometimes or I might do lose braids and wash it that way. It all depends on how dirty it is. It makes detangling a lot easier and aftercare a lot more manageable. I tend not to do this if I have a lot of product in my hair. I‚Äôve found that if I do, my hair is not as clean after. "
LordAsbel,9tyvhf,"Does anybody here wash their hair in twist?&&&If you do, what are the steps you take when you do it? Do you ever unravel your twist? I did this last night, and what I did was this.

1. I pre-pooed/detangled my hair with water and a conditioner, twisting as I go by section

2. I washed my hair and scalp with shampoo and conditioner, leaving the twist in

3. I went by section and unraveled the twist to put in my deep conditioner, and retwisted then when I was done (this actually didn‚Äôt take that long)

4. I washed the deep conditioner out. After that I waited about half an hour for my hair to get damp instead of soaking wet.

5. I properly twisted my hair, instead of doing those chunky twist I washed in.



Is this what y‚Äôall do or am I making this harder than it has to be? I loved the results when I did this because I got 500% less breakage and tangling  than when wash my hair without doing this."
omojos,9tyvhf,"I don‚Äôt like twisting and untwisting, so I stopped. Plus I have to detangled to get into the twists so I just detangle when I style into the twists after washing.

If it works for you, you should stick to it. Edit- I want to try it if I can reduce breakage, but I need to get the patience back."
originalsoul,9tyvhf,I pretty much always wash my hair in twists. It cuts down detangling so much. 
qrtrlifecrysis,9tyvhf,"I wash/condition and detangle  in (untwisted) sections (4 on both sides, 8 total) and then do the twists by sections. It‚Äôs much faster for me personally."
yourbestbudz,9tyvhf,I use to wash in twists but I would still have to retwist afterwards. Wash day was like a 2 hour process. Now I wash and do final twist in shower. I‚Äôll oil it after the shower. 30 minutes top doing this.

The frank and honest advice is to make new friends who won't judge you for being natural. Your family won't care as much as you think. 

Good luck. "
lavasca,9tkyu9,"I would recommend this now that you‚Äôre a few months in:


Get a natural looking weave of similar length for the next 3-6 months.

WHY:  You still look like you. People get used to seeing you with natural hair. If you‚Äôre not big chopping you can be gentle with the area of yout hair where natural and relaxed meet.

It gives you the opportunity to practice natural hair care without making a huge transistoon at once. 

Gradually trim away the relaxed hair.

This will likelu help keep your hair healthy and keep both your mom and grandma quiet!  


Also, cutting your hair can be traumatic.  Long to short people treat me very differently.  I can‚Äôt deal with wearing my hair short.  I tried a weave once that was actually shorter than my hair but showed my length MAJOR difference in how people treated me. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether my hair is relaxed or natural as long as it is longer.


TLDR - Use a weave while transitioning to get mom & grandma off your back and ease the change. You can condition and protect your hair simultaneously."
spycegyal96100,9tkyu9,"Tips for transitioning to natural hair and dealing with reaction from family and friends?&&&I'm 22 and I've decided that I want to transition to my natural hair. My mom relaxed my hair when I was 7 so I've had relaxed hair for the majority of my life. My relaxed hair has always been long (about bra strap length) and healthy. My last relaxer was in August so it's been about almost 3 months post relaxer. The longest I've gone was 4 months post relaxer because I was studying abroad and my hair was still fairly manageable. I want to transition for 2 years and I've been thinking of getting Senegalese twists or box braids as protective hairstyles.

The one thing I'm worried about is my reaction to my natural hair and protective styles from family and friends. My grandmother has relaxed her hair for at least 50 years (!!!) and my mom is relaxed too. When I told my mom about going natural she was okay with it but made comments saying that as a natural I will never have long hair again. My grandmother kept asking about why I want to go natural. My dad is fine with it and said to do whatever makes me happy.

I'm more concerned about my friends though. The majority of people in my friend group are white or non-black POC and I find that some of my non-black POC friends may make nasty comments about my natural hair. One of my friends who's asian said to not get braids or twists because people that get that hairstyle always end up looking half bald (a dumb comment). Considering they only know me with relaxed hair I'm scared that I'll be faced with weird comments and questions or treated like an animal in a zoo because of my hair.

&#x200B;

Anyway, does anyone have tips for a 2 year transition to natural hair and comments from friends/family?"
sqwzmahmeatybts,9tkyu9,"It's scary, and it's foreign, and it's stressful but it's worth it, I promise.

Embarrassed_Cow,9ti7xi,Worry about your edges&&&So when I was a little girl my mom pulled my hair too tight and I lost my edges pretty quick. I dont actually remember ever having them. My whole family seems to think that theyll grow back one day but I'm 26 now and they are what they are. I keep my hair really healthy. I cant put it up obviously because of the edges and Ive been natural since I moved out of  the house. I spend a majority of my time and money in making sure its the best it can be. Its still pretty short because of the chemicals my mom put in my hair my whole life as well.  I dont have a question or anything. I just wanted to remind people that its not always the persons fault when it comes to edges. Parents make a lot of decisons that can end up doing irraparable damage. I now have to think of new and creative ways to style my hair and I have to wear bandanas to cover it if I want wear it up and most of those cute youtube styles cant apply to me. I just want to remind parents to be careful and love their childs hair. Ive had self esteme issues my whole life because of it.&&&Hmmm maybe my diet is apart of the problem. A long with a bit of life stress making it fallout. Otherwise i keep it hydrated and dont touch it.&&&Yea when ivd gotten them done ill tell them a million times to chill on the edges that i have and everytime they still do them to tight. I cant tell while theyre doing them cause i cant feel it but then i get home and just end up taking them out and doing them myself. Its rediculous.

lottikey,9ti7xi,"True, also I just want to add, if you're someone that does baby hair and gels their edges often, that leads to breakage.  A lot of these edge control products are like two steps away from glue and they should be washed/removed daily so our hair don't break off.  "
n_kaye,9ti7xi,"I had absolutely no edges for the longest time. My hair was permed without my consent, and my mom didn‚Äôt know what to do with my hair once my new growth really started coming in. I wore ponytails pretty much every day for almost 15 years, and as a result of that my edges were snatched. 

The first year I was natural, I did castor oil on my edges every morning and wild growth every night. I didn‚Äôt manipulate my TWA into any style that would cause tension around the edges. I prayed over these lil baby hairs üòÇ They‚Äôre still nowhere near where I want them, but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm finally seeing results almost 3 years after the big chop. "

No, please don't. 

Now I've been known to experiment with different substances such as oils, teas, herbs, and essential oils but I do draw a line at this sort of thing.

It isn't made for your scalp. "
omojos,9tay8v,"I remember about 10 years ago a lot of women posting online raved about putting Monistat on their scalp and claimed positive results. The biggest problem they constantly complained of is getting headaches from using it, which is one of many signs to me it shouldn‚Äôt have been used on the scalp in the first place. Keep in mind what the cream is for. It reduces yeast. I believe the whole point is it is anti-fungal. You can get the same results from using products that are actually okay for long term application to your skin, instead of vaginal medicine.

Tea tree oil does the same thing. Also keeping your hair from being suffocated or dirty helps. Jamaican Black Castor oil also helped a small balding spot in my edges grow in stronger without breaking off."

danysiggy,9t17om,"Did they get bought out recently? That‚Äôs what happened with Shea Moisture, right?"
mochigoodness,9t17om,"I hope not.  I really like her like a lot, I've actually stopped checking out other lines, I've turned into a Camille Rose junkie.  

I do wish she sold sample packs of her line, I really didn't like her Lavender collection, (which I bought in it's entirely), it was not a good lavender smell, IMO.  

The Leave-in trio though, wow.  The smell is awesome and this morning, after using the honey hydrate/latte/tea trio, my hair was amazing.  The honey hydrate in particular, smelled soooo good and really felt good on my hair. Very moisturizing. 12 hours later, no where near as defined :(  But for the first part of the day, glorious defined curls.  

I'm actually beginning to wonder if I should give up wearing my hair out.  Maybe I should look at more updos.  Or adding a gel on top of the trio.  "
musaab1996,9t17om,I use the leave in and the shit literally completely dries out my hair. Lol 
omojos,9t17om,"When the founders sell out and make their product ‚Äúmainstream.‚Äù They alter ingredients and advertising to appeal to white and other non-black women with looser textures and less kinky hair. They abandon what worked for the black people who made them rich in the first place, and we have to find something else while white women rave about products that have the same ingredients they can get in most other brands that already existed."
