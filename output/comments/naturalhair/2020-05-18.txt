Cerikeyo,gq27gp,"I got 2 keratin treatments done a couple of years ago by two different stylist. The first time my hair reverted after a few months but the second time, it did not and I had to completely restart my hair journey."
ScrubDaGround,gq27gp,Keratin treatment removal?&&&Is it possible to get a keratin treatment removed or will I have to do a big chop? I got it done back in March and my hair is still straight... I just want my natural texture back.
TurtleDive1234,gq27gp,"Sodium chloride will strip the treatment from your hair. Saltwater in  s spray bottle then use a clarifying shampoo with sulfates. 

It might take a few times. Be sure to deep condition afterwards."
devonmoray,gq27gp,"I've had the Brazilian blowout treatment done, I know it's not exactly the same but if I'm correct the Brazilian is actually a bit longer lasting than a keratin. With time it should we wash out. But to get the process moving a little quicker try a Bentonite clay with apple cider vinegar mask, sulfate shampoo, or baking soda! It should lift the product from your cuticles. Definitely deep condition after and only do that maybe biweekly at most."
-deejay-,gq22fe,In not sure is the leave in. I've been using it for years and never had flakes. What other products did you use?
ReilaReborn,gq22fe,I had that same problem! I was trying to pair it with Naptural85's hair cream and Tgin products. Needed up just taking it out of my routine all together. Now I use TGIN leave in and butter cream. My hair stays moisturized until wash day or refresh day (I wash twice a week) and is flake free and seems happy
crunchybags,gq22fe,"Definitely had this same problem too! I used to use Cantu leave-in conditioning cream and curl activation cream, and it had great effects on defining my curls and smelled so good, but it just didn’t mix well with my hair for some reason no matter when I tried it, so I ended up switching to other product lines. Currently use Shea moisture and Carol’s daughter, which I have no problems with."
likehopeandpain,gq22fe,"cantu leave in conditioner flakes&&&so i think i have 4c hair and i hate taking care of it but i’m trying lol so whenever i use cantu leave in conditioner, it leaves white flakes. is that normal or should i be trying to find another brand to use?&&&when i wash it, i usually use the shea moisture jamaican black castor oil shampoo and conditioner and then the cantu leave in."

AfriendCalledFive,gpy14p,"Is it safe to use a flat iron after blow drying with flaxseed gel?&&&

I blow dry with homemade flaxseed gel and a heat protectant. Flaxseed oil has a low smoke point (225°F). 

Would this coating fry under the flat iron (350-380°F)?"
Ashleyjasmine,gpy14p,"More than anything it would probably just leave your hair looking stiff. I’ve never heard of using a gel to heat style hair. 

A high smoke point doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good heat protectant though unless it actually slows down the transfer of heat your hair."
chikn_nuggit,gpy14p,More than likely. It's best to use something like olive oil or an oil that has a smoke point above 400°F.
raina6006,gpy14p,It’s safe but it won’t protect your hair from heat damage
HispanicShovel,gps9jn,What Is My Hair Type?&&&
caryn123,gps9jn,4c
cslrc,gps9jn,"Imo 4c doesn't always equal undefined, but I'd say 4c based on your very narrow coil diameter"
honey-molasses1,gps9jn,4c??
princesajojo,gps9jn,"Is this what your hair looks like moisturized?&&&If so I'd say 4c. If not, wet it/moisturize and it might be different."
Thestarthatfell,gpp6r6,"You can use a blow-dryer at your roots and gently pull to stretch it or you can use no heat and band it. I use around three scrunchies for each section. I wrap it twice at my roots, and do the same to the middle and ends of my hair and leave it overnight. Both should work. Hope this helps!"
itz___lili,gpp6r6,Help!&&&Does anyone have any tips on how to stretch hair after a wash and go?&&&Since I've tried this method before I wad doubtful thay it would work this time as I've tried it many times. It didn't work again😔&&&Thanks

moldrixx,gpmrp6,"What would you recommend for someone learning to braid.&&&I was born to a white mum and black dad. Neither amazing art managing my hair and I never really had braided styles unless an auntie did them. Now that I'm looking to protect my hair with braids and I have no idea where to start to teach myself. 

If anyone's able to provide any tips I'd greatly appreciate it."
redditaccount_1234,gpmrp6,"I use YouTube,  just search for whatever style you want or protective style in general then look for one with your hair type and length"
Haleysierra96,gpecl2,Can someone tell me my hair type?&&&
KalikaLightenShadow,gpecl2,4b 🙂
Softinleaked,gpecl2,Best way to tell your hair type is if it’s wet. Looks like 4a/b. But you can tell from how your hair looks just after shampooing and conditioning
caryn123,gpecl2,4b
Urfavorganiccheeto,gpbdbo,When I had a twa my holy grail product for detangling and moisture was the shea moisture shea butter detangler. Try it out & see if ur hair likes it :)
montero19,gpbdbo,"How do you keep your type 4 TWA from tangling after you wash it?&&&So right after I wash my hair even after I had detangled it before hand always gets retangled. My hair currently isn’t long enough to fully twist and section in the shower, it’s ranges from 3 1\2 - 4 1/2 in. I just need to keep it detangled long enough for me to twist\ braid it up"
