Interesting_Win_9434,tizfxd,"i was yesterday years old when i found out my 4c ass could get head lice. üòµ‚Äçüí´&&&smh.&&&thank you sisüíó and yeah i literally would not have known had i not taken a magnifying glass app to my head to look for ‚Äúflea‚Äù bites. i thought my cat had given me fleas. whole time i‚Äôm the one with lice for god knows how long.  any itching i felt i assumed was just dryness!&&&yeah i suppose it is. medical racism is real. where are you from?

i have that same experience of being exempt from lice checks, smh.

thank you for your suggestions though i def will get the treatment and continue cleaning vigourously&&&thank you so much !!&&&fuck‚Ä¶i used olive oil and seran wrapped my hair last night. now i‚Äôm going over every piece with coconut oil and scratching out the nits.

hopefully this helps‚Ä¶ 

can i ask what the topical treatment was?

i have a funny feeling i got it in highschool as well, i always thought my hair was just tangling in itself. i also dealt with anemic symptoms due to all the blood loss‚Ä¶

i also washed prrrty much any and everything i own üò≠&&&you know what it‚Äôs not that bad, definitely less stressful after taking the time to nit pick every piece of hair and suffocate the hair. 

the good thing is, they‚Äôre not dangerous, or majorly harmful. more of an annoying pest.

i thought the small black things i saw were fleas or ticks! that would have been worse for sure.&&&a palm coloured person, no doubt. not sure how, who, what or when or how long. but treatment is going well!!"
PittaPasserine,tizfxd,"Lice live off the blood within the hair strand, so the more product you have on your hair, the less they‚Äôre able to latch on/find you desirable to eat. So, it‚Äôs not so much about strand types or dirty hair, lice love clean hair. One of the reasons why you don‚Äôt see a lot of lice in the black community is because of the abundance of products used and hair styles that make it difficult for lice to hide and latch on. 

I used to work at a lice salon that only used natural products because we worked predominantly with kids. Neem oil is a natural pesticide that suffocates and kills them. They also dislike most essential oils, but adding peppermint oil to a leave in conditioner that you spray on your hair multiple times a day will also deter them from latching on.

The tough part about getting rid of lice is fighting against their life cycle. By the time you have visible adults, they‚Äôve already laid several eggs you can‚Äôt see or comb out for the next generation, but don‚Äôt be discouraged!

Removal happens in stages that can take weeks/months depending on the severity and whether or not natural or chemical products are used. Our routine was the initial wash to remove any live lice, saturating with neem oil and combing out mature eggs, then allowing a week go by so the remaining eggs mature enough to be picked up with the comb. Saturating and doing a thorough comb through happens weekly until they‚Äôre gone all while changing/washing your bedding daily and using a natural lice shampoo/conditioner + peppermint oil spray.

The most effective thing you can do is continuously comb with a lice comb in sections after saturating your hair with the oil of your choice."
Shannonball513,tizfxd,I just cussed out loud! I hope you get treated and are free from lice very soon.
books_n_food,tizfxd,"I looked this up awhile ago... apparently the prevailing theory is that lice in North America adapted to grasp round hair shafts better (straight hair has rounder shafts) and curly/AA hair has oval shafts. 

In West Africa some lice have adapted to grasp oval shafts more.

I can't find a really great source, but here's a [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-african-americans-get-lice#signs-and-symptoms) article that has links to CDC and British Journal of Medicine studies within it...

I started looking into it because I had never gotten lice even when everyone around me did and thought it was peculiar. OP, sorry you made your way into the 0.5% of African Americans who get lice :("
excelzombie,tizfxd,Oh no! That sounds like it would keep me up with anxiety. Good luck!!!!
godlywinter,tizfxd,Welcome fellow 4c girl with lice! Nobody believes me when I say I got it in high school. I make sure to correct people think saying ‚Äúat least I can‚Äôt get lice‚Äù as a comeback. Not only can we get lice but it‚Äôs wayyyy harder to get rid of them. I had to get a topical prescription
jclassic100,tizfxd,How the hell did u get it is the question
lillonb,tizfxd,"This interesting‚Ä¶. Is this an American/ North American thing ?  
My friends were telling me  about this too this week‚Ä¶..Apparently during elementary school, they were exempt for head lice check because of their hair type.  I was so confused as I had never heard of this before and know for a fact that 4C hair do get lice. Some schools in some countries have adopted white shirt uniforms to be able to spot lice on students. 
You  will need to clean your bedding,bed, clothing, all combs/ hairbrushes. If you believe you got it from school then clean your backpack‚Ä¶. Go with the the medical treatment that way you know for sure that every lice /eggs were killed."
mochigoodness,tizfxd,"I grew up with my mom telling me that black people didn't get lice.  Maybe it was the hair grease we used, or that hot comb, lol, but growing up, no one I knew ever got it.  

Lice now are super bugs, they'll infest anyones head."
annoyedenby,tiyolm,"it‚Äôs not embarrassing at all, personally took me more than three years and you still always keep learning. there‚Äôs always gonna be split ends and knots (knots especially if you wear your hair out like wash n gos or twist/braid outs), that‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt prevent and you‚Äôll always have to trim every 3-6 months but there are ways to protect your ends more of course. for me twists are a great way to prevent fairy knots, wash n gos give me many fairy knots so i don‚Äôt keep doing them for more than a month before i go back to low manipulation styles. you can reduce split ends with low manipulation styles as well but also handling your hair gentler with better tools, especially when you detangle. a good, flexible wetbrush with a lot of conditioner, a few sections and a lot of patience goes a long way when you detangle, i spend most of my wash day on detangling since i noticed my hair splitting a lot less when i detangle gently. and of course protect your hair at night, don‚Äôt touch it too much, and dont manipulate it too often in a week. but again, at the end of the day split ends and fairy knots always come back but the gentler you are with your hair, the less damage you‚Äôll cause."
esedotexe,tiyolm,"Just snipped off two of the ugliest split ends I‚Äôve ever had&&&Most of my hair is fine but I do get split ends and fairy knots here and there. I usually just snip those off individually. The last trim I did on my entire hair was in December.

How else can I prevent splits and knots? This is kind of embarrassing to admit but after over a year and a half of my big chop I still don‚Äôt fully understand how best to take care of my hair.&&&I‚Äôm trying my best to. I‚Äôve found that the longer I go without washing my hair, the drier and itchier it gets. So I‚Äôve made a routine to wash it each weekend&&&Thank you for the tips. My hair also tangles more when I attempt a wash n go (emphasis on ‚Äúattempt‚Äù) so my go to style is two strand twists. I‚Äôll try to trim more often, take my time, and be more gentle with my hair. My main issue is patience so I need to work on that"
kittennn3,tiyolm,Keep u hair moisturized
quantumishz,tiycb9,"help&&&What type of haircut do I ask for if i want to do high top two strand twists? I can‚Äôt find a really good visual on the internet, so any response would be greatly appreciated."
UsefulLab1298,tiw900,"Oil reccomendations?&&&When I was still transitioning, coconut oil seemed to work well but after a big chop, it would dry out my hair pretty bad. Since then I've tried olive oil, argan oil, and black castor oil, but none of them have felt right. The black castor oil felt very heavy, the olive oil left a film, and the argan oil was almost like it wasn't there at all. I'm trying jojoba now but would like more suggestions.&&&Today is my first time using it so I'm not sure yet. So far I haven't had any issues. Thank you, if this oil doesn't work out ill definitely try those as well.&&&I try to use oil to seal in moisture. My hair takes a while to soak up water and dries quickly so it can get a bit dry even with me regularly attending to it. I don't use gels often as they've really weighed down my hair in the past but I'm open to trying it for sealing in moisture."
ontariodwarf,tiw900,"What are you using the oil for? I think the chances are high that you can find a well-formulated product for the same purpose you‚Äôre using an oil for, but it‚Äôll work better. I occasionally use oil for a scalp massage, in which case I prefer a store bought blend of almond, olive, jojoba, and castor oil; or straight castor oil; or the wild growth oil (such a gimmick but I bought it on a whim when I was really into scalp massages). If you‚Äôre using an oil to seal, you might be better off using a good gel. If you‚Äôre using it to moisturize, you should look for a good leave-in instead. I think coconut oil is effective in that it can penetrate the hair strand and make it so that your strands don‚Äôt soak up too much water when you wet it, but you need to make sure you‚Äôre washing your hair thoroughly. Most other oils will not do anything to moisturize your hair and over time will just make your hair feel drier if you‚Äôre not washing them off well (i.e., using a cleansing enough shampoo and washing often enough)"
radvhf,tiw900,"Avocado oil and grape seed oil are two that I‚Äôve used. Grapeseed oil is thinner than avocado oil. But jojoba is the lightest one I know of, how are you finding it?"

ChrissyChrissyPie,tivksb,"How do you tuck your braids for crochet styles, thick, longish hair&&&&&&Sorry, my question didn't come through.  I can't figure out how to put up the end of my braids.  I have 8 cornrows going back,  and that part works out OK (I do have a big head,  so I could do 10).

The excess length of the braids just gets in the way.  I don't know how to hide them.&&&It seems like the text part of this post did not come through. I'm looking for what to do with the hanging parts of my cornrows. I have tried crocheting them backup through their own braids, and it makes my braids tight and really big. I try putting them together at the back of my head, and I end up with a couple of big dookie braids. They sit like lumps under the crochet hair&&&I have to look that up.

Different-Push-5593,tivksb,I have long thick hair and I usually just sew the ends down with thick weaving thread and a curved needle.
Independent_Ad8963,tivksb,"It would of been better if you had a bit more cornrows but try the teasing method.

https://youtu.be/0vwUxcRWtcE"
Infinite-Swordfish97,tivksb,I think you need to feed the ends of each cornrow into the middle of the next cornrow like they do with a weave base. You‚Äôd have to redo them but that‚Äôs what I do with my hair when it‚Äôs crocheted and it‚Äôll lay flat and stay tucked.

Infinite-Swordfish97,tirbc7,"Nope, it‚Äôs fine."
M_Aku,tirbc7,I'm type 4c and blow dry my hair about that often. My hair hasn't been heat damaged yet. I use a blow dryer with a comb attachment and medium heat.
cmrobinson96,tirbc7,How often can I safely blow dry my hair? I‚Äôm a male and 2 strands are my got to right now. But my hair SHRINKS. I prefer to get as much length as possible.

xopeachh,tiok7o,"What the most you‚Äôve spent on braids?&&&Stitch braids, box braids, Fulani braids, feed ins, etc."
AffectionateAnarchy,tinxvy,"Ive never asked but have tried to google on my own, I wanna know where to start to get my hair at its best self because Im not tryina spend $$$ on products that dont work. And obviously even if I find my hair pattern it doesnt guarantee what worked for one will work for me but it's somewhere to start rather than going in blind. Ive beeb natural for a long time but most of that was spent in locs or a fade and when I did have loose hair I had no idea how to take care of it which was kind of fine at 19 but not so much at almost 40 lol"
ChemicalReturn1522,tinxvy,"It definitely helped me at first. But with people changing formulas and not saying anything, people lying saying they have 4c hair because I guess that's popular now, people lying about processed hair or having hair extensions in and claiming it's all natural it's not the same anymore. Some channels I followed made my hair worse, so it's honestly best to just look stuff up and see what works. Especially since many people have multiple curl patterns. Mine ranges from essentially straight in the front to super tight coils in the back."
ChickenDumpli,tinxvy,"I've found that most people have different 'types,' over their entire head, it doesn't have to be just one type.  You might have 4a or 3c in the front and 4b in the back. Or 4 b in the back and 4c in the front - any combination of things. So I just kind of look for videos where there are some similarities, but I also watch all kinds of hair videos because I learn from them all and find them interesting.

Also, here's the other thing...

Black people are mixed period.  If you've been in North America, South/Central America, the Islands, etc., in this hemisphere for centuries, that's just going to be the case. 

No need to say biracial this or mixed that, or my grandmama was this or that -- unless you're speaking of an experience where a white parent/or grandma didn't know what to do with your hair.  

Other than that, there's no such thing as a 'biracial,' hair texture.  

Lenny Kravitz is biracial with 4C and Russell Wilson is not biracial and has 3A.&&&It's not just the folks with kinks and tight coils.  In fact, I see more 4A/3B wanting to know, 'But what type am I?' It gets tiring.  Because IMO it does stem from insecurities and special snowflake syndrome, or sumpin'."
Disastrous_Can4962,tinxvy,"bc we want to look like our hair grows out like a wash and go. in reality it is kinky/coily/curly all in one. 

look at boosie the rapper. that's type 4c hair. it's not a wash and go design. just saying."
External-Dare6365,tinxvy,"It‚Äôs so annoying. It‚Äôs like 90% of the questions in this thread. Most of these people are only asking because it‚Äôs a trend, they don‚Äôt really want to know anything further than that."
Fabulousness13,tinxvy,Mostly it‚Äôs a trend.  Your hair is either ‚Äú kinky or curly/ coiled‚Äù.  It‚Äôs a word gimmick to sell products that took off by these hair companies.. And if you do your research on how it really got started you‚Äôll stop worrying about it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
FictionalDudeWanted,tinxvy,"I wish I could follow 4C hair care instructions but it doesn't work for me.  I'm a 3b 3c (both my parents are black and I'm not light skinned) and I don't know what my crown is.  I noticed over the years that if I don't follow hair care instructions of someone with my hair type....my whole hair type, then I have problems.

Ppl are hung up on curl pattern as if it's so easy and bc they think curls are better.  I don't care about any of that.  God put this hair on my head and all I wanna know is how the F%$# can I detangle under an hour.  How can I keep it moisturized bc I'm a High Porosity that seems to have a drinking problem, meaning my hair is never moisture satisfied?  Why can't I use combs, picks or brushes?  Is there a detangling brush out there that won't rip my hair out?  Why can't I pick my roots like most naturals?

Why does my hair tangle while I'm detangling it...it wraps around ANYTHING like it's holding on for dear life, strangling each other. Why does product sit on top of my crown section?

How would a type 4 be able to help me with any of this?"
Lvicren,tinxvy,"I always grew up not understanding my hair because my mom constantly put treatment in it. It wasn‚Äôt until a few years ago that I was able to recognize that my hair actually was curly in its natural state.

I usually ask to know what hair products or styles work best for me because ultimately, all hair stylists don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, especially if they only work on one specific hair type. Or some that do know what they‚Äôre doing want to charge extra if your hair is ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. I just wanted to learn how to save my own money and the possibility of getting hair damage from someone who isn‚Äôt capable or willing to deal with my hair."
M_Sia,tinxvy,"I used to agree with this but the longer I stay on this sub it‚Äôs annoying for a lot of the posts to be what is my hair type when you can easily look at old posts, YouTube, and on the internet.

Misisme20,tinxvy,Gives you insight on how styles might turn out.
SevereDifficulty843,tinxvy,"Right?? You wanna look for products for your porosity, not your curl pattern."
Star_Grouchy,tinxvy,"I feel like the hair type thing is just another way to divide and shame others for a curl pattern. I've had to get onto my own mom about this because that's the main reason she went natural so she could shame my curls vs her curls. I have 3 different curio patterns to her one and she assumed my hair is dry because of the hair type I have.  It annoys me because I went back to my natural hair state to feel free and happy with the afro I've wanted since I was a child. People always ask in the most annoying way, ""your hair doesn't get dry or have bad breakage""? I'm like üôÑbro why would it my hair is healthy and well taken care of so no."
TheYellowRose,tinxvy,"I think we're going to start removing them automatically and have automod give the typing chart and then a spiel about why it's not that important to know.&&&Your curl pattern doesn't really determine what products you should use, your hair's porosity and strand thickness are more important in that regard."
Thestia,tinxvy,I guess I want to know what an idealized version of my hair could look like so I can set realistic hair goals. It's motivating and keeps me from feeling disappointed if what I want doesn't match the results I get.
banana-n-oatmeal,tinxvy,"I used to think it was relevant to find the good products for my hair type, now I care much more about my porosity"
briccflaire_,tinxvy,Right.
bsclmc,tinxvy,"people here are being pretty negative...or sensitive. its useful to know for styling, those charts are confusing, and maybe they don't have people who understand to give them any feedback in real life.  its basically a buzzfeed quiz... its not anti whatever"
dayoroy,tinxvy,"Unfortunately black people are still obsessed with making their look less kinky. This is why most black products design for 4 hair type don't use the term ""kinky"" or ""coily"" but ""curly"". Some people with 4c hair would fight to call their hair ""tight curly"" than just saying ""kinky"". So of course they will have an obsession with their cul pattern. They'll do a lot of test to be sure if they don't have 4A and how to make it looks 3c"
francium-eater,tinxvy,When I first went natural I wanted to know my curl pattern so I could find youtubers with a similar type (4c-4b) to better understand which routines and products would work best for my hair. Idk why it‚Äôs suddenly a bad thing now to want to know it ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
happyhippoking,tinxvy,"They want to know if they have ""good hair."" It might be better now, but there was a point when influencers tagged Type 3 as Type 4 to get views and engagement. A lot of Type 4 naturals would use the products and techniques, then breakdown when their hair wasn't looking like Luhhsetty. 

Look at different Type 4s and they will look vastly different based on texture, porosity, diet, climate, genetics. Fine hair looks and behaves different than coarse hair.

The whole hair typing system was based on Andre Walker and he said, Type 4 hair should be relaxed. I don't understand why we're using a system created by someone with texture discrimination ideals."
jas0094,tinxvy,"Any type of hair can do a wash and go. Saying one type of hair can't is texturist tbh. With the right tools and products, the kinkest of hair can do it. I know bc I do it and most of my hair has very tight coils"
mochigoodness,tinxvy,"One reason that I can think of is that it's OURS.  It's unique to us.  

Plus, there is a type of power in naming a form.  4A, 3C, they describe a specific type of hair pattern unique to us.  Without this type of coding, what was there?  Kinky?  Nappy?  Words that for some do not have a positive image to them. 

Granted, some people still have that association with the numbering system, but hopefully with time it will change.  

I remember when the Andre Walker first came out with this numbering system, it was the first time I'd seen my hair in its natural form viewed in a positive light, I think it was Cree Summers who was the 3C poster child at the time.  I remember thinking, that's my hair and it looks great!"
ohandalso,tinxvy,"Why are we obsessed with finding our curl pattern?&&&I've noticed that a lotta folks here are trying to find their curl pattern. Obviously it's important to learn and understand your hair so you can best care for it. Curl pattern is just one part, why are we so fixated on it?

Seems to me, related to the preference for looser curls. Being black, we are most likely in the 4 category. And can have many different curl patterns on one head, I know I do.

So what's the obsession?? Would love your thoughts."
popcornnhero,tinxvy,The mods should get pin an image of the curl pattern chart. It is starting to become annoying now.
randomasking4afriend,tinxvy,"I want to know because I've never grown my natural hair out before. I'm a guy, always had it cut short when I was a kid and then I sort of got coaxed into texturizers (relaxers). This is my first time going full natural, and I happen to be mixed (biracial mother with biracial parents and her hair is like 3a or 3b, and then black dad) so I really haven't a clue right now. And at the moment my hair is barely an inch long so it's hard to tell. I just want to figure it out because it would help me figure out what's best for it and what styles to do.

It also comes from a bit of ignorance on my part, when I was younger I didn't really know there were different natural hair types. Nobody told me, and a lot of people made me feel like my natural hair was undesirable and that nothing could be done with it. I know now that's wrong."
shelee14,tinxvy,Yeah it‚Äôs probably just to narrow down how to best care for their hair! My stylist actually doesn‚Äôt even believe in using curl patterns since hair in the same curl type can still be very different - so I‚Äôve been on a journey of just figuring out my unique curl pattern and what it needs to thrive :) But I suppose knowing your curl type could be a good place to start!
shinydolleyes,tinxvy,"I think people forget there are a lot of people who have no idea what their natural hair really looks like.  When you big chop or are starting from scratch,  people want a general idea of what their hair will look like as it gets longer and although it doesn't matter for products, it can matter for hairstyles.  Even Black Girl Curls, who many people in this subreddit follow, advocate for looking for hair inspiration in hair that looks similar to yours.   Although curl typing won't get you there alone, having a general idea of what you're looking for in terms of hair inspiration can be helpful and the typing system is probably the closest thing we have to a jumping off point that is a general point for discussion."
watshouldiget4dinner,tinxvy,"I think its a good place to start if you're going natural for the first time. It helped me find YouTubers with similar hair as me which was next to impossible when I would just type in ""curly hair tutorial"" cause you just get a lot of white women. And ""curly hair tutorials for black girls"" can give you sooo many different textures. 
My curl pattern changes depending on how much and what products I have in my hair, but finding a specific hair type gave me a really good place to start. I think after a certain point we don't really use hair types, but it has its place."
xdarkcupidx,tinxvy,"THIS.  I think it's a troublesome narrative to assume that only mixed-race people have this hair type. I'm just looking for info on how to style and maintain my hair. It's important to know that. My Brother has a different type of hair type than me. Everyone in my family has different types of hair. So you're correct. The things he does would not work for me. My hair is easier to manage than his but I had to figure out how to get some moisture in, etc. My hair is less bird nest-like than a few months ago. Lol"
xultar,tinxvy,"Porosity is so much more important. Everyone has great hair and curl types but it doesn‚Äôt really matter. 

You can look for the ideal state all you want. If your porosity isn‚Äôt the same as the ideal type you‚Äôll not see it reflected until you get the correct products if ever."

Numerous_Win_1123,tijv5m,"Wear long term protective styles so you don‚Äôt have to worry about doing your hair on a daily basis, eventually you‚Äôll get out of that phase as it gets longer."
mumbojumbocandy,tijv5m,"Hair is becoming difficult.&&&Hello, ive posted my journey on here before and I love my hair‚Äîbut it‚Äôs getting to the transition phase where I can‚Äôt just put it in a style that doesn‚Äôt take at least an hour and it‚Äôs making me frustrated if it‚Äôs not in twist or in a protective style.

My hair is on the thinner side but the longer it gets the more management. Should I get locs? Cut it? What are your suggestions"
mymilkshakeinyoface,tijv5m,"My hair is below bra strap length now and I enjoy doing braid outs as they're super easy...but I'm also tired of that & humidity has showed up to kill curls daily. Honestly, I'm going back to lace front wigs.

I was doing protective styles like box braids & weaves but missed wearing my hair plus the cost & time of taking down box braids is too much unless you get large braids. They're very cute on other women. 

I tried & loved being a ""Straight Natural"" by using heat once or twice a month after washing and deep conditioning, but got some split ends over time. Doing silk presses at home made hair more manageable & sexy to me. I wrapped it at night & used oil on my ends with no issue.

I will say the longer it gets the better natural styles look. Maybe reduce the number of braids & twists when styling? That helped some. 

Some people also leave twists in without undoing them. I do mine at night then unwrap them or the braids in the morning. It's easy for me & looks good as a cute, curly style to simply retwist or braid at night. 

I'll be rocking lace fronts, braid outs, & try to learn low maintenance, protective styles for now. Maybe your hair grows super fast but I worked for this length. I'm not cutting it off lol."
stealthpursesnatch,tijv5m,"I‚Äôm thinking of locking my hair. I‚Äôm not sure if this is just a passing fancy yet, though."
Jetshark970,tig3tk,Looks cool to me
Quaruku,tig3tk,"Tried applying styling gel while my hair was sopping wet and got this. Turns out my hair isn't coily, but just wavy when hydrated. Currently on the fence between whether this is actually kind of a cool style or makes me look homeless. Thoughts?&&&"
Shantiabooker,tig3tk,You have very loose curls it looks like to me. Learn your hair type then learn how to care for that hair type :) your hair is curly and more coily than a wave but it‚Äôs not as tight as a type 4 coil. I‚Äôd say you have 3A hair! That‚Äôs just what it looks like to me
Significant_Cod6846,tig3tk,"I think it looks fine but sometimes you have to train your  hair to curl. I would try the curl gel for a couple of weeks, and if it still looks the same then that's just your curl pattern. I would also let it grow out a bit more. Your pattern just might be really really loose curls

Edit typo"
jesscat25,tig3tk,Uhm no you don't look homeless. Everybody's hair is different. Maybe yours just doesn't curl and that's okay. Just be confident and rock your hair however you feel comfortable
needhelpeveryday,tig3tk,"I like it! You can definitely see the definition. I say you should rock it!

Doesn‚Äôt look homeless to me!"
starshopping___,tig3tk,Maybe you could try a mousse rather than a gel
stealthpursesnatch,tig3tk,Your hair is too short to expect a lot of curls. Let it grow and try again.
Independent_Ad8963,ti5nrm,It's okay if you're a slow braider. How long is your hair? The longer the hair the less braids or twists you can do.
Maniachi,ti5nrm,"What do you guys do after wash day?&&&Hey,

I just finished washing, moisturising, and sealing in the moisture with some hair butter.

What do you guys usually do? I am seeing videos of people braiding their hair, but I am a very slow braider.

Are there any easier ways to manage my hair after washing it?

If it helps, my hair is 4c?&&&When I stretch it out, it reaches mid breast height. Otherwise it almost reaches my shoulders.
The reason why my slow braiding is an issue, is because I don't have time nor strength to braid my hair most of the time... so I was looking to see if there was another way to manage my hair after washing it on wash day. But I guess not :/"
ontariodwarf,ti5nrm,"I normally shampoo, condition, detangle, apply leave in and then either do a twist out with mousse and wear the twists for a day or two, then take the twists down and wear them out; or I‚Äôll do mini twists with curling custard and leave them til the next wash; or I‚Äôll do a wash & go with curling custard. Wash ‚Äî> moisturize ‚Äî> style ‚Äî> repeat 

As far as making your hair easier to manage, I think the best thing for preventing tangles and dryness between washes is keeping the hair stretched or in twists (or braids). Any size twist/braid is good. For me, twists keep my hands out of my hair and it‚Äôs locked into a twist so it can‚Äôt get tangled, and even when I wear a twist out my hair is somewhat stretched. Wash & go‚Äôs are hard bc my hair tangles and dries out so fast but I don‚Äôt do them often"
