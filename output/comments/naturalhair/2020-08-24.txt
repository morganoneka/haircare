Spy_cut_eye,ijghu0,It may be time for a trim. My hair looks similar to yours and this happens the most to me  when it is time for a trim.
Unchained925,ijghu0,"My hair was doing this and I thought that‚Äôs just the way it is. Then I did a pre-poo and it got better. 

(EDIT: I also did all the other things as well for my 4c low porosity hair type including the deep conditioner after the wash, without protein which causes my hair to be brittle. Leave In as well I didn‚Äôt want to imply that just the pre-poo alone worked.) 

 I just used bottled aloe vera gel and an oil combo named Africa‚Äôs Best herbal oil and took special care to oil my ends. I did this twice about two weeks apart and it helped. Then I used fresh aloe and worked it and the oil and fresh aloe from root to ends, just as I had done the other. The results were so much better with the fresh aloe. I did it again Sunday night and there was so little breakage, that I‚Äôm not sure it wasn‚Äôt all just dead fall. I have 4c low porosity hair (tight curl, thin and delicate, easy to break and hard to retain moisture) and this pre-poo is the only thing that helps my hair absorb moisture. There are likely a lot of options for pre-poos and I only know this one. My hair is less frizzy each time I do this which I just started about 7 - 8 weeks ago. When I combed through today I could feel the tangles but my hair didn‚Äôt break. I‚Äôm new to natural hair, so others may have better info, I just wanted to share my experience cause breakage is heartbreaking. I would cry a little inside looking at my hair on the floor.

Before you try suggestions find out what type hair you have. If your hair isn‚Äôt like mine, these suggestions may do more harm than good. At first I was doing things for different hair types from mine, which hurt my hair. First do no harm. I wish you the best and no more breakage."
curlycasta,ijghu0,"I'm not 100% it could be a few things.   Is your hair feeling damaged or broken in any places? You could try slicking your hands with a drop of oil while you're styling to try and prevent breakage to the hair cuticle from the twisting and turning.  Breakage can also be a hydration/vitamin issue.

If it doesn't feel damaged it could just be your natural shed cycle happening.   Do you keep your hair in twists/braids most of the time and rarely let it loose?  Hair sheds as a normal part of the growth cycle so it could just be hair that has shedded naturally but didn't get a chance to fall as your hair was up in a protective style.  

Finger detangling may not dislodge all of the shedded hair so when you go to style your hair the manipulation disturbs it and causes it to fall.  

Hope this helps :)"
moon-lin,ijghu0,"hey guys can anyone telly me why the ends of my hair always fall off when twisting/braiding my hair after washing? i finger detangle and do it gently all while my hair is pretty damp, but there's always strands that fall off at the end of the twist. I feel like it might stunt my hair growth&&&&&&Oh yeah i did have jumbo braids in for 3 weeks before, but a lot of my hair came out in the shower already. I've noticed this happens anytime I do twists though, like even if it's one day after taking them down and redoing them again. Also i don't know how to tell the difference between naturally shedded hair and breakage, but those hair strands are not very long and overall the ends of my hair aren't the thickest. Also do you know how I can find out if it is a hydration/vitamin issue? Because i was spraying my hair with water every 3rd day with water and adding Jamaican black castor oil as well.&&&I haven't trimmed in a while. it doesn't sound like too bad of an idea to do that again haha thanks"

Gramsx,ij3pw5,"How long should I wait after a protein treatment to use rice water.&&&It's been almost a year since my big chop, well I should say big trim because the hair stylist said my hair isn't damaged but I just have damaged ends so she just got off the ends.

But anyway, my hair has never grown past my jawline due to years and years of forced relaxing.

I finally started my natural hair journey September 2019 and my hair has not grown at all. 

I plan on trimming my hair myself(I haven't trimmed since September 2019) and then doing a protein treatment(Aphogee). After that I want to do a rice water treatment but rice water has protein and Im not sure if that will be too much protein for my hair. 


I want to start off my journey correctly now, balancing moisture and strength as I believe a big reason for my hair not growing is due to moisture overload, breakage, lack of protective styling, and inconsistent wash days.&&&Ok thank you!"
flirtandflutter,ij3pw5,"It will depend on how protein sensitive or protein loving your hair is. My hair generally loves protein...I can do a protein treatment every week, and I can also do a rice water rinse with protein on top at the same time. Other people, would have to wait two weeks, or a month. 

If your hair is truly overmoisturized you should be able to use a lot of protein right now without breakage (you can't have protein overload and overmoisturization at the same time). I would just do some more research to confirm your hair is overmoisturized and then expriment...do the rinse, and see how your hair is after (does it have signs of too much protein? Crunchy, brittle? Or is it still too soft and mushy?), then based on that decide whether to proceed with the protein treatment."
IAmTwistedT,iiupmx,"I am thankful for my struggle because without it, I wouldn‚Äôt have stumbled upon my strength.&&&"

ooakrei,iil7rv,Your hair looks so moisturized !! What products do you have in ??
reese81944,iil7rv,You look amazing!!! What are you wearing on your lips?
EEOA,iikp8b,Late but if your hair is too soft (without product) you might have moisture overload. So you would actually need protein to balance it
jordan-marie-smith,iikp8b,"It IS creamy, but what about Cantu leave-in with argan oil? It's, like, the only product I need. Moisturizes and styles"
naomirross,iikp8b,"4a hair need a little help ü•∫ü•∫&&&So I recently noticed that without products my hair is actually really soft. I think I might be adding too much products in my routine. Do you guys have any recommendations for leave in conditioner or products that are less creamy but moisturizing. Preferably without protein&&&Oh okay, thank you!"
openonpurpose,iikp8b,"You may fw the Qhemet Biologics Cocoa Tree Detangling Ghee! It's a little too light for my 4a hair as a main leave-in (I can get by if I layer a heavy oil), but moisturizes so well when I need two days worth of hydration before wash day. It's a bit expensive but it comes in a big ol tub and lasts a while. If you can stand the smell of straight chocolate that might work :)"
Classyassgirl,iifg9x,What have you tried?
LadyMuffnStuff,iifg9x,"Learning about my hair&&&Hey guys I had a quick question. I've been natural no heat since July 2015 and I still can't seem to find the right combination of products to help my hair. It's definitely healthier but my curl pattern is still pretty flat. I'm not sure what curl pattern I have either. Any help is appreciated!&&&Product wise too many to count. Leave in conditioner, co wash, hair mask. I'm also learning how to style my hair and I'm working on braids right now. I don't get the right enough yet but it gets better every time I do it.&&&It's kinda tight curls when it's wet and it takes forever for water to soak though if I don't help it along. At least a minute or 2."

Itsureissomethin,iibiqd,Thanks for documenting your journey - love to see it!
angelnamedtia,iibiqd,"It‚Äôs the thick locs for me&&&&&&What I‚Äôve learned about my 3 mo old starter locs 

Three weeks ago, I decided to embrace my puffy roots and let my hair bud more. This has made me feel very connected to my spirituality and how beautiful it feels to grow my locs. It feels like I‚Äôm growing a succulent on top of my headüå±

The first two months, I had a hyper fixation on retwisting my hair. I would wash and retwist with clamps every two weeks. I noticed that some of my ends kept unraveling and it was starting to get worrisome. I started washing my hair every week (shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner) and two strand twisting my locs. I fell in love with the curly look ‚ù§Ô∏è 

I also decided to put rubber bands at my roots and on the ends that were unraveling. After three weeks I removed the ones from my ends and they don‚Äôt unravel anymore. The rubber bands at my roots are loose enough to move up and down the shaft of my hair so they aren‚Äôt causing tension. I also used aloe Vera in my latest wash day. I received a lot of comments about my hair looking darker :)

When I style my hair, I apply peppermint oil to my scalp (literally heaven) then I apply grapeseed and peppermint oil to the shaft of my hair and a quarter size of coconut oil to seal. I wrap my locs into a tshirt and wait 30 minutes. After, I dampen my hair with aloe water and seal it with flaxseed gel (very good humectants)
I palm roll and then wrap the frizzy bits around the loc as if I‚Äôm two strand twisting. After it looks smooth, I palm roll one more time and push the rubber band back down to my roots. 

That‚Äôs it! A lady in the grocery store today had beautiful red locs and I complimented her. She asked how far along I was and told me my locs look really good for three months ü§© I felt divine. 

I have received a lot of tips about how to make my hair ‚Äúgrow faster‚Äù & ‚Äúdrop faster‚Äù from people in my everyday life. Some have suggested not washing my hair for months? Interlocking and using rice water. I have considered the rice water just out of curiosity. For rest of those tips, I‚Äôm not comfortable having a dirty, itchy scalp that can result into an infection from scratching and making  Microdermabrasions. No thank you. 

I appreciate tips because they inspire my journey, it‚Äôs just that my main focus is learning from my hair and tweaking something every month to see if anything changes. 

My favorite part of this journey is how much more spiritually aware I am. I am some what of a Star seed and have always had a vivid dreams and ancient intuition. Growing my locs has helped to be patient, shameless and to find meaning in my own life through plants, the stars, the sky. To focus on things that call to me and not rely only on mainstream gimmicks that modern spirituality tries to offer. I love my crystals and tarot cards tho lol. Patience has made me slow down and I‚Äôve noticed that I see hundreds of synchronizations weekly. 

I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt do this sooner. I even have favorite locs that I can located in the back of my head instantly. It shocked my manager when I wanted to show him a specific one. 

I‚Äôm going to buy myself a small hair gift every month. I‚Äôm locking into loc crystal jewelry and jewelry that symbolize things that are close to me spiritually. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading a single word I typed! I really appreciate reddit for embracing me with open arms. It is truly amazing and inspirational."
