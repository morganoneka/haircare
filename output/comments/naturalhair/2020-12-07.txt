EthiopianBrotha,kcnv2u,I keep hearing ppl say Shea moisture is bad do I buy or no?
angelnamedtia,kcnv2u,"I was feeling insecure about my locs but I realized all I needed was a good clarifying shampoo and a protein treatment. Look at that shine and shrinkage! 🤩🤩 swipe to see the products I used&&&&&&I had day four hair in the first picture so I knew something was up. My locs shouldn’t have been looking THAT crusty&&&I put them in the pictures:) just swipe&&&I only recommend certain products from them but not because they are bad. They make very good quality products. I know they are not as popular since they started advertising as curly friendly and not just black hair friendly so I know some people feel some type of way about that. Not all of their lines are for everyone BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS IN EACH LINE. That’s seems like common sense but anyway. For example, my hair loves the curl soufflé but hates the curl enhancing smoothie bc I’m low porosity and my hair doesn’t like creams. That has nothing to do with Shea moisture."
mklykl,kcnv2u,"Shea moisture isn't bad perse, they just changed their formula. Their curling souffles used to be a lot thicker but they thinned it out to cater to looser textures. I have locs and I use the black soap shampoo. Its supposed to be clarifying but I've found it does leave residue if you aren't careful due to the texture. I am about to switch to an actual clarifying shampoo because of that. Their hair masque is really good and thick. I used it when I was a loose natural, but now that I have locs I'm avoiding the creamy conditioners and sticking with oils to moisturize.

All in all, shea moisture isn't bad, just different than before. I would still recommend some of their products."
sly_sista,kcnv2u,What products did you use ?
kplains23,kcnixe,"The whole Shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil line for (the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in) are soo good! and then i personally use mielle’s babasu mint deep conditioner, and then eco styler gel! and for twist outs and braid outs  i use the blueberry bliss styling cream. And to de tangle i use the felicia leatherwood detangling brush! It’s a lot but I hope that was helpful lol"
siderphobia,kcnixe,"Mixed girl in need of help&&&Hi! Im a mixed girl with some pretty  curly hair and im only recently getting into hair stuff, any products or items you guys would recommend? Thanks so much for any responses <3!"
Sperez04,kcl82d,"Forgot to post this, but I retwisted my two-strand twist Bantu knots and got a fresh fade with it&&&"
DamaDeGatos,kch8ce,"Actually, two strand twists are about as low maintenance as you're going to get while still keeping the hair healthy. I have 4c hair as well and everything I've tried and read points to this as being the perfect style for those of us who don't want to constantly manipulate our hair.

Regardless of the style you have, though, your hair will have to be moisturized and at least slightly detangled (unless you do want it to loc) on a regular basis. Braids, faux locs, and wigs are often worn as a ""protective style"" without any attention given to our actual hair for weeks. This ultimately causes damage. The other low maintenance style I wear are halo twists, but I'm still unraveling and re-moisturizing that after about 4 days."
RandomWeebBitch,kch8ce,Low Manipulation styles for 4c hair&&&I am 16 yrs old and I have recently been getting more into styling and taking care of my 4c hair. The only problem I have run into is that a lot of cute styles and stuff I see online are achieved through heavy and constant manipulation of the hair. My hair is healthy but it does not really grow much if I am constantly touching and styling it weekly. I currently have my hair in easy 2 strand twists. This style is fine but I have to retwist it almost like every week or two. I was  look for a style that I can keep in for a couple of weeks without manipulating it much that would be great. I can't cornrow or install braids of myself so I feel kinda stuck. any suggestions would be appreciated
DamaDeGatos,kcg2tw,"I have 4c and low porosity. One thing that I've recently started to do is after applying a water/aloe vera juice mix and leave in conditioner, I put on a plastic cap and a Hot Head for 10 minutes. Take that off and my hair is far more moisturized than it is when I do not apply heat. Then I follow up with either a styling cream or directly into styling. 

The aloe vera juice helps me prevent single strand knots and you might only need to use water. 

And to clarify, I'm talking about a daily leave-in conditioner. The other time I use a Hot Head is after applying deep conditioner on freshly washed hair."
oliverrrrrrrrrrrr,kcg2tw,"Hair tips and tricks for low porosity hair&&&So for my whole life I’ve had a hate relationship with my 4a/4b hair and I’m now starting to embrace it and I’m learning a lot of new things but I would love more suggestions. I’m mixed (my dads black and my mom is white) and I grew up in the north so no one knows how to do mixed hair. My mom always kept my hair in a very short Afro so when I finally grew it out I would just put it in a messy bun and I still do that (I’m 27 lol). I’ve spent so much money on hair products and nothing worked so I always gave up, well I just learned about porosity (today actually) and about how that is the biggest factor. I have very low porosity and now that I know that what are some routines that you do that help? I’ve been doing a bunch of research but it’s a lot of info at once so I figured asking here to see what everyone does. Thank you😊"
subway_eatflesh,kcg2tw,"I have 4a-4b hair as well with extremely LOW porosity. To retain moisture, I found great results using Longaid Curl Gel. You can usually find this in walmart. 

Before using, I make sure my hair is damp and then I using leave in condition. I then use the curl gel with a Denman brush. Doesn't leave a crunch either!"

JkLion1998,kcf7ys,"You are gorgeous! Your locks look amazing!

I really need to start taking better care of my hair. Need to invest in these oils."
Monasgma,kcf7ys,A m a z I n g! Beautiful!! I’m going to add lime to my routine. Don’t know why I picked that one ingredient out. But it resonates. Lime and the coconut! Or in this case castor oil. I’ll let you know.&&&I’m going to try and find it. Thanks.
amourpetrichor,kcf7ys,They look great!! I’ve been thinking about starting locks for a while. How did you start the process?
honeypablo1,kcf7ys,These are lovely! And you are so beautiful!
moonlitedelite,kcf7ys,"Beautiful! I want to loc my hair soon, love it!"

wrknprogress2020,kcf7ys,"23 months locd! I retwist my own hair with aloe and oils once every 8 to 10 weeks. I oil scalp with castor oil or Jamaican mango and lime spray as needed. Being locd is such a relief and it fits my adventurous and carefree lifestyle!&&&&&&Thanks!!!&&&If its something that you'd want to try, meet with a loctician for a free consultation(if you haven't done so already). They can recommend something for you. Ive seen people that have fine hair and AMAZING locs. You would probably have to start with a coil method and minimum manipulation for the first few months.&&&I use sweet almond oil and/or grapeseed oil for retwist. 😊 I wish you success on your journey!!! And thanks!&&&I started with 2 strand twists. I did ALOT of research in what size I want my locks to be and in locating a knowledgeable loctician. The loctician I went to in MD had been doing locks for maybe 8 years. And I am very happy with the results. So of course hair type plays a factor, and she knew how to twist my hair to get my desired look. Im 4b mostly, and some 4c, with very thick and full hair.&&&Thanks!! I wish that I would've done this years ago!&&&And just to clarify, it is the Jamaican Mango and Lime spray oil. It comes in a green bottle 😊"
AkMichelle96,kcdckw,Niiiiice!!!
BearMaple,kcdckw,"Got my hair braided for the first time!&&&&&&And the reason I'm so greasy is because I took this picture post workout 😳&&&I'd love to!

So basically I try to eat super healthy. I cut out alcohol and as much refined sugars as possible with the occasional treat. 

Products I use:
Bulldog's sensitive face wash and Allafia's Africa's secret skin cream&&&I think the biggest thing for me is getting enough sunlight, hydrating, and avoiding processed foods!

For products I use bulldog sensitive face wash and Allafia's Africa's secret moisturizer.&&&The biggest thing is a well balanced diet and hydration :)

But the products I use - bulldog sensitive face wash and Allafia's Africa's secret moisturizer.&&&Thanks 🙏🏿"

IAmTwistedT,kcd85f,Have patience with all things but first of all with yourself🙏🏾&&&
TimTamDeliciousness,kcbj3j,The only thing I can think of is that the hair on top of your head has a different porosity then the hair on the sides and that the moisture treatment your doing may be the wrong product. There may be too much or too little protein for example depending on porosity. You may have to use two different deep conditioners for your hair.
falcom1031,kcbj3j,"Black man struggling with hair&&&Hello everyone, I've spent the last couple of years just just trying to treat my hair a great as possible. Usual cut was a fade with medium hair on top. Since the beginning of this year I've been growing my hair out. Took some cuts and by now I have a pretty long evenly cut affro. I've followed all the tips I can for my hair, but I'm stuck. For some reason my hair on top is brittle and looks like it'll fall off any minute while the curls on my sides look super healthy. It's even more noticeable after weekly deep moisture treatment when my sides of the affro have really wide curls but the top of my affro is stiff(with the exception of a few strands) and dries out fast)

What are my next steps? Do I just have bad hair? At one point I trimmed the affro but the hair on top still grew back looking dead. Came to reddit as a last result before I just cut it all off"
medalton,kcbj3j,"It could be a product thing or it could be a health thing. Are you taking any hair, skin, and nail supplements? That could help, along with drinking enough water and eating a nutritious diet and lite regular exercise.

Also it could be that you have hard water and just need a shower filter. Hard water can also affect your hair. 

I'm not an expert, but those are some thoughts.

Edit: fixed a typo"

BananaMedicine-,kc0h0w,Maintaining braids with natural hair&&&Hello everyone. I’m still pretty new to different hair styles and ways to take care hair of my hair and have recently started putting it in braids. Was just wondering if there are any tips on keeping them hydrated and maintaining them.
