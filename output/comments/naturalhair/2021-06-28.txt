Fiorak,odz3wq,"Switching to wash and go's--how to avoid single strand knots?&&&So I've pretty much been doing exclusively twist outs for the past few months. I had my hair blown out and trimmed around February/March. However I've gotten a little tired of twist outs and am considering trying out wash and go's, to reduce time taken on doing my hair. What do you guys do to avoid/deal with single strand knots? I know trims are recommended but most hair salons around me straighten hair to trim it. Would it be equally effectively to trim my hair while it's in twists or blown out? Any other wash and go tips? I usually use a leave in and gel or mousse and it'll last me as long as I need.&&&Do you think one of those soft ""bonnet"" driers would work too? There aren't really any natural hair salons near me unfortunately&&&Yeah I'll try using the bonnet dryer! I've mostly just air dried but that takes forever"
happyhippoking,odz3wq,"I trim in twists. I haven't noticed any uneven-ness. It's a better trim with more twists than less twists.

I'm going to be honest. If your hair is prone to ssks, wash n gos are a challenge. As the hair dries and shrinks, the curls wrap around each other.

Use a heavy gel to weigh down the curls. Avoid air drying and stretch the wash n go as soon as it dries; banding method, blowdryer with concentrator attachment, gentle twists. An oil will help lubricate the strands to prevent them from wrapping around.

I also like doing wash n gos on already dry hair or even damp hair. Not a true wash n go but my hair is already stretched and dry so the strands can't knot."
joiejojojo,odz3wq,"I have very tight curls and I've been doing wash n go's exclusively since January. I go to natural hair salons where they trim the hair in its curly state and I wash my hair twice a week (I work out regularly). Aside from getting regular trims, the best thing to do is to make sure you set the style properly under a hooded dryer. I've seen some people further stretch the hair after it's dried but I've not had a problem with single strand knots so far"
Understanding_Naive,odvyny,Hmmm might be a 2c/3a? Even some 2b as well..
vijay109801,odvyny,"Hi guys, I need some help figuring out my hair type and style options any thoughts?&&&"
M_Sia,odvin7,2c 2b.
RM_Arsenal_24,odvin7,I would say 3a/3b
ianpimentel3,odvin7,"Hey guys, need some help figuring out my hair type&&&&&&Thanks! Appreciate ur help&&&Can u explain why it would be a 2 type rather than 3? From what I seen so far it doesnt look like any 2 type&&&hey guys, so as you can see I'm pretty mixed (I'm brazilian so that's really common around here) and have almost ever wore my hair short - it looks a lot straighter and I hate it, my roots are kinda straight really. For the rare times I grew it out I just absolutely had no idea how to care for it and maintain it, so all the pictures above show my hair without the use of any products and no styling whatsoever - just regular shampoo and conditioner and a light comb running my fingers all the way thru my hair - so it looks absolutely different each and every day, a lot of frizz going on, not a lot of definition, some looser curls. Now my mom and sister have embraced their natural hair and I decided I might do it as well, so I started growing it out again, but i can't seem to figure my hair type out (maybe around 3a-3b?) and because of that I have no idea where to begin, what my hair routine should be like, how I should style my hair or even what products I'm supposed to use to maintain it. Literally any help is appreciated! Thanks so much&&&Btw i'd like my hair to look like jalen green's if i'm not reaching too much"

ISTICHESI,ods7p4,:33< Looks like 3c/4a to me
Wertyasda,ods7p4,4a Possibly 3c at the back but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs closer to 4A&&&No way near 4c or 4b
grassfeed-beef,ods7p4,"Do I have 3b/3c or 4b/4c. My hair is fully dry after a shower.&&&&&&Thank you. I think my curls have changed over the years. When I was younger my hair was super long and looser, obviously cause of the weight. 

So trying to figure it out. Thank you.&&&I was thinking the same!"

Character_Menu,odkqcv,You come a long way
RahBreddits,odkqcv,Wow I love it! You grew it back + more
SunflowerinVirgo0903,odkqcv,You're gorgeous
TexasProud311,odkqcv,"Love the look! I've been natural since 2015 and have gone through 2 big chops since then. My last one was in 2018. My hair has grown a decent amount, but it's nowhere near the size of yours.

You and your hair are beautiful!"
Wertyasda,odkqcv,Did you big chop or?
cartierbrii525,odkqcv,"4 year difference, my hair came a long wayü§©&&&&&&No, I just kept my hair in braids + I wore wigs to keep my hair protected&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you very much!!&&&Thank youüòä"

Infinite_Bath8231,odcgow,"Looking for Curl Cream Recommendations&&&I (21F) have long 3B hair, with some areas being more tight and some being a little more loose. I've been natural my entire life but I'm always trying new routines to help reduce frizz and add in moisture. I've tried a lot of different creams including Shea Moisture (worked well but broke me out), Aunt Jackie's (not a fan), Carol's Daughter (also not a fan), etc. I'm looking for a cream to provide definition and prevent frizz (I do use a gel though), preferably not coconut scented, I HATE coconut. If anyone has any recs or tips, they'd be greatly appreciated!&&&Thank you!&&&Thanks!&&&I've been on that sub but almost everyone I've seen on there has  really large type 2 curls"
Risa290,odcgow,"I have 3b/3c hair, and I use Giovanni 2chic leave-in conditioning and styling elixir (avocado and olive oil) and the matching spray. I also use their shea butter and sweet almond oil shampoo and conditioner - it really works well on my mixed hair. Hope this helps!"
hanap8127,odcgow,Not a cream but uncle funkys daughter curly magic. I prefer to have a stronger hold gel over the top but it‚Äôs my first product that I apply in the shower.
moderatef,odcgow,maybe r/curlyhair could help
rg3mc,odcgow,"I recommend the curly curl cream from Taliah Waajid, I swear by it with my mixed hair, only thing to tame the frizz lol"
thefatdomino,odcgow,"Innersense Inner Peace Whipped Creme Texturizer! It‚Äôs ridiculously thick (like it won‚Äôt come out of the jar if you turn it upside down), smells amazing, and will last a really long time. I have 3b hair and use I Create Volume on soaking wet hair, diffuse, and then break the cast with the texturizer using praying hands."
MissD34,od9pdr,"Why not try other heat-free methods of stretching your hair like Bantu knots, african threading, afri-threaders, etc‚Ä¶?"
hanap8127,od9pdr,It‚Äôs an investment but the revair is perfect for this. It stretches the hair and doesn‚Äôt use high heat. You can even switch to no or low heat. I like that I don‚Äôt have to manipulate my hair with a comb or brush as it‚Äôs drying.
stealthpursesnatch,od9pdr,"No, it won‚Äôt."
thatuserdoesntexist-,od9pdr,"Will blow drying my 4c high porosity hair on low heat give me heat damage?&&&I notice my hair thrives when it is elongated and not shrunken up. I still love my shrinkage but I can‚Äôt deal with the tangles and fairy knots. I was thinking of blow drying my hair more often on low heat but I don‚Äôt want to slowly give myself heat damage because of this. If I put a light oil throughout my hair, will this help me?"
