_charliezena,q5m4ld,Can u guys see my progress?! All thanks to a professional TRIM. Who knew i wasn’t trimming my own hair correctly!&&&
Outere1011,q5kzy3,"Why does my scalp get itch so quickly&&&So I washed my hair on Monday and my hair started itching quite a lot on Thursday. I used to put a mixture of oil and keracare grease on my hair but I’d get a lot of build up and my scalp would get dirty and itchy quickly. Then I got a silk press and refrained from putting anything on my scalp and noticed that my scalp didn’t itch until the two week point. So I though let me try not using anything on my scalp, but it hasn’t helped. I wash my hair around every 10-12 days and don’t rlly have time to wash it any more frequently. What can I do?&&&It might’ve been avlon? And I wash my hair in twists bc my hair is quite long so it helps a lot w detangling, but maybe I’m not washing my hair properly? Like how many rinses are you meant to do?&&&Once a month and I never cowash&&&That could be it! I just twisted my natural hair"
answermanias,q5kzy3,Do you know what shampoo your hair stylist used and if they added anything else to your scalp? Is your scalp fully clean after washing?
hanap8127,q5kzy3,Wash your scalp more often. Shampoo twice.
jaejaeok,q5kzy3,What style? My hair itches more in tension styles like braids and twists - even if it’s not tight.
joiejojojo,q5kzy3,How often do you use clarifying shampoo?
moo_xx,q5kzy3,"I tried all types of OTC shampoos for itchy scalp and none of them worked. My dermatologist recommended tea tree oil and it works very nicely. I use the shea moisture one. Don’t use it directly on the scalp because it can be very harsh, it should be diluted with a carrier oil. Hope you get some relief soon."
Apprehensive_Air_908,q5j6rx,Don't do it! My Daughter had has hers done twice after being completely natural and never having her hair straightened and we both regret it!!
Disney_Villian,q5j6rx,"I get silk presses every 8 weeks so I can get a professional trim.  My hair reverts just fine when I wash it.Do it but:

-don’t put a lot of oils and butters in your hair before hand

-throughly detangle first. Blow dry your hair as straight as possible.  

-don’t apply anymore heat on it, that’s how people get heat damage

-use it as a chance to do a thorough trim and cut whatever needs to go."
Love_Amethis,q5j6rx,Do you blow dry your hair? I would make sure they spray a generous amount of heat protectant on your hair. Also they should only go over your hair once with the flat iron. No double passes as that would lead to a ton of heat damage.
Outere1011,q5j6rx,I had a silk press in July and it was fine! No damage. I did an olaplex treatment before and after and my hair reverted perfectly. Just make sure you go to someone who only does one pass with the straightener and pay more if you have to!
PicklesGalore20,q5j6rx,Kera care has a great system called thermal wonder
WorldlySleep4002,q5j6rx,Don't do it please. It will still be damaged no matter how hard you try to protect your curtly hair.
_charliezena,q5j6rx,"I got one and It did not damage. Go to a REAL PROFESSIONAL. The damage from a silk press comes from tryna keep it straight! I suggest not adding any additional heat from the original press. If it starts sweating out, just let it sweat out!"
cocoacruncher,q5j6rx,"Go to a professional who is known to care for natural hair (natural hairstylist) in your area, they probably have an instagram so you can see their work."
yahgirlT,q5j6rx,Almost 2 years natural and heat free! now wanting a silk press but so fearful of heat damage. what is everyone’s experience after getting their first silk press? should i do it?&&&&&&did she try to keep it straight or only the day she got it straightened?&&&since i’ve been natural i’ve only blow dried 3 times for braids. and i agree!!
Francais838,q5fvw2,Pop off!

strawberrysweetpea,q5fvw2,"You are gorgeous in every way, like even the energy you give off. I’m jealous of how well your afro fits your face!"
veez73,q5fvw2,You are beautiful 🤩 and your hair is super healthy
ChumChums2400,q5bsco,I tried the water and gel method and tried adding much more and a leave in conditioner overnight to see if it would change anything and it really (didn't to me anyways)!&&&&&&I've done everything and nothing works! I guess it's not meant to be 😭&&&Just spraying some water over it and wearing a bonnet overnight
DaleYuki,q5bsco,"I personally wet my hair, apply leave in and then a curl activator (with more water sprayed onto my head) and then rub it back and forward into my head then seal it in with a gell. Idk if this will help but hope it does!"
cocoacruncher,q5bsco,"First apply some kind of gel with humectant properties nothing thick (l use mielle organics coil sculpting custard OR uncle funky’s daughter curl magic) these will be your leave ins. After applying it to DAMP hair use a an actual hair gel. (I use any aunt jackies gels. Not sure about eco stylers, i plan on trying it on my next wash day but feel free to experiment!) Also make sure its all distributed properly root to tip, divide the hair into sections if you must. Prayer hands method, squish to condition, just make sure your products are absorbed properly, all the motion in your hands with heat the hair and products to absorb it."
joiejojojo,q5bsco,What do you mean by adding water and a leave in overnight?
Specialist_You_2186,q5b53r,Cross Cross Protective Style Perfect for Teenage Girls&&&
Cornrow30,q566m2,It's not perfectly balanced but i'm satisfied.&&&
Knightmare1147,q566m2,How long have you been growing it out? I had a friend that cut his in high school and couldn't manage to grow it back out/was too impatient
SoloMuffin,q566m2,Yes!!!!!!
not_nae-nae,q566m2,Your fro is dope🤩
popcornnhero,q566m2,Nice!
s_elendur,q566m2,Thanos would have an issue with it. But I like it. I wish I could get a nice 'fro.
yehhhhs,q566m2,Lucious
No-Base8204,q55up0,"How do I style and care for a TWA?&&&I want to big chop but I'm not sure what style I should do for it. I want something cute and fitting for my age since I'm a college undergrad.

Should I was it wash it more? I do have seborrheic dermatitis.

Perhaps I can curl it somehow? I can imagine putting a headband on.

I am also tenderheaded and have a sensitive scalp so I'm not ready to big chop my head until I see a neurologist about it. (I have already seen my primary and dermatologist about it and they refer me to a neurologist)"
BlueMaroonLaflare,q55sth,On my feel good days i go ahead and wash n detangle my hair. I 2 strand twist it and wear a bonnet.
CocoMonter1019,q55sth,Recently I’ve just been doing a lot of flat twists and braids that I can pin up and wear with a satin bandana or wrap. Keeps me from having to wash every week when I’m super busy. Also cuts down my wash time cause the tangles aren’t as bad as with my wash and go’s
FantasticHamburguesa,q55sth,"I was in an incredibly intense school program that left me little to no time for self care. 

I twisted my hair up. Basically. I’d wear the twists for a very long time (I know it’s gross but I had no time to do my hair). Probably like 6 weeks. Then I’d take the twists down, wash my hair, and twist it right back. When my hair was feeling a bit dry I’d spray a mix of warm water and moisturizer (lotta body) on it. I use grease on my hair so it stayed very moisturized for a long time. 

I hope that you start to feel better soon. :("
Lovelynell4,q55sth,"Mini braids or twists when I finally have a moment of clarity. Leave in for 3-4 weeks. If no strength still, six-eight loose braids around my head, and that can be put up like a bun. If at my lowest, it’s honestly just one or two plaits. 
I’m do happy to hear us talking about this topic and helping one another ❤️"
Lovelyprofesora,q55sth,"Not sure where you’re based, but there are many stylists who understand life and have gone through shit of their own. Maybe search for a stylist who’s good with kids (how I found a gentle dentist for myself!) as they may be used to styling with a gentler touch. Then just be honest. I went through a similar rough emotional period where my hair paid the price, and I found an amazing woman who helped me get my hair back on track in a way that I could maintain. Good luck. ❤️"
No-Base8204,q55sth,"Does anyone have advice for taking care of natural hair when depressed?&&&I have been neglecting my hair and my scalp is too tender to go to a salon. They will rip out my hair!

I don't want to it to lock.

My hair is damaged so I might just big chop it again anyways and style my TWA. 

Wash Day and detangling and twisting my hair (I just do 8 chunky twists) takes a lot out of me."
answermanias,q55sth,I highly recommend the African pride shampoo I recently started using it and it helps with detangling knots. After I’d try to do four braids which makes it easier for the next wash day.
etoileleciel1,q55sth,"Putting them into braids or twists is always good. It takes me a long time to do my hair, and lately, I’ve been washing them in twists. Then, finger detangle in the shower during conditioning time. I also make sure I deep condition once every couple of weeks. My hair gets dry in the winter and Seasonal Affect Disorder is a real thing for me. It’s been working well. I want to braid my hair, but I don’t know where to get hair from?"
evolstreak,q55sth,Agreed. Mini braids or mini twists so you don’t have to “deal” with it for a bit.
jaejaeok,q55sth,"When I’m going through a lot, I have an evening to go to twists or braids so I don’t have to touch it again for 3 weeks. Helps me when I need time to focus on my menta or emotional priorities."
Macha_16,q55nj7,My DIY deep conditioner&&&
fivetenash,q55nj7,"Hi there, please include your recipe with the measurements in a comment for people as well."
Macha_16,q558lr,"Deep condition with my DIY ""Frankenstein"" deep conditioner makes my hair super soft and moisturized.&&&&&&I basically just eye ball it. Using my conditioner as a base in a pump bottle filled about three quarters and add roughly about two tablespoons of black castor oil, coconut oil and honey. And add about 4-5 tablespoons of fermented rice water."
Micro-Fiber,q558lr,What's the name of your base conditioner?
fivetenash,q558lr,"Hi there, please list what your deep conditioner is. What ingredients you used to make it and the measurements so that we know, thank you."
AbandonedSeige,q4wp18,"They're telling you wrong bro. I've been rockin two strand twist / twist outs the last several months. I wash my hair with twist in once every week and a half  to 2 weeks. Definitely wash your hair especially if you're active. 

I only leave my twist in for a 3-4 weeks max and then take them out. My twist out last for about 2-3 weeks and then I retwist.

Edit: judging from your twist there ready to come out too. To wash your twist, lather your scalp and gently massage the shampoo onto the twist. Rinse off and pat and squeeze the water out. I'd go ahead and wash and give it overnight to dry then take them out judging by how they look now. 

If you like the twist you can retwist immediately or rock the twist out for awhile"
Full_Island_1190,q4wp18,Please wash your hair with shampoo once a week
Notreallyaaron,q4wp18,Just got my twists in for the first time a few weeks ago and everyone's been telling me I can't wash... my hairs been a little itchy although I've been resisting scratching.. is there any way I can moisturize my scalp while taking care of my hair???&&&&&&Dawg you're the best really I'm definitely washing tonight also do I wash with a durag?&&&It just came in! Do I wash my hair out after letting it run through?
Skyoff_Lyfe,q4wp18,"you can use a scalp rinse, I workout alot and wear protective styles most of the time and so I don’t shampoo alot either because if I braided my hair or wearing two-strand twists I can’t take down these styles necessarily so I use a scalp rinse

I use TPH scalp rinse “Master Cleanse” (sold at Target), it’s not gonna create a lather, it’s very runny so be mindful when distributing but it will completely erase the itching. . it definitely does for me 

but when I do shampoo while wearing a protective style I’ll follow up the scalp rinse with Shea Moisture’s Charcoal & Mint Gentle shampoo (the mint feels *really* good on the scalp)"
knowables,q4wp18,"Wash the twist in a stocking cap, I did this for my braids and lasted few weeks longer."
MelSaf02,q4tock,First post&&&Hey y'all! I'm so happy to join this reddit&&&Thanks
lilfreaksh0w,q4tock,welcome!
CndyKsses,q4nxsc,I've been under the impression that cold water closes the cuticle. Therefore it should be the last step; otherwise I can't stand cold water touching my hair
Lacasadelmango,q4nxsc,"It really depends on how your hair reacts. My hair loves steam and hot water, cold water doesn't really work for me and kind of makes my hair feel like straw. You can go wrong with warm water!"
PinFlaky7122,q4nxsc,"I agree with this. Start with hot/warm water. Rinse conditioner out with cool/cold water to close the pores in the hair strands and ""lock in"" all that conditionery goodness."
Right_Surprise5369,q4nxsc,"I've never tried washing with cold water but I do rinse my hair out with cold water after conditioning. 

But I personally find that washing with warm water helps a ton with the detangling process. Just from running warm water over my hair alone most of my knots/tangles go away."
Riungufaith,q4nxsc,"Wash day with cold water&&&What's your take on washing and conditioning your hair with cold water? Has anyone ever tried for maybe a month or so?. How was it?&&&Nice.&&&That means if I use cold water, eventually the products that I use will cause buildup?&&&What difference do you feel?... I hope you don't mind me asking that&&&Thanks"
blue-eyed-cat,q4nxsc,"I tried it long ago and it didn’t do anything for me. I’ve heard warm water helps open your hair strands to let moisture in. Cold water seals hair shaft. I only use warm water now (not super hot). I want my hair to be able to receive all the moisturizing products I’m giving it, not for those products to just sit on top and build up."
joiejojojo,q4nxsc,It doesn't make a difference. Just use a comfortable water temp for you
lostundeadgreensea,q4nxsc,I only rinse my hair with cool water. I think it makes a huge difference in my hair.
Butlindaa,q4jngw,"I would suggest getting a leave in. Only I’m using that for a whil one where you can use to style as well. 
I like Nubian heritage olive oil leave in spray"
ChumChums2400,q4jngw,"I try to do stuff with my hair but it never changes 😭 I added gel in with water to define my coils/curls, finger coiling but it never looks good to me! Idk what to do at this point&&&&&&I'll add more and see how it goes!&&&Just want a different style that isn't a braid. I have had this style for a long time now!&&&Thank you so much!"
ESQ2020,q4jngw,Your hair looks fine. What are you trying to change?
GoldenHummingbird503,q4jngw,I think your hair looks nice and the shape suits your face. You look great as you!
Monasgma,q4jngw,"Yeah. Ok. I’ll bite. It looks amazing. From the depth of color to the strength it flosses. Your coils are amazing no Cap. Try only using finger detangling. Then, friend, Deep Condition Regularly. You got this."
bdd4,q4jngw,"You have to condition your hair all the time, not just the day before you want it to look nice. It's coily on the ends, so it doesn't look like you need a trim. You just have to be consistent."
cryptpinnacle,q4jngw,your hair looks amazing omg
hanap8127,q4jngw,I love your hair but I agree with using gel o soaking wet hair and smoothing in small sections. I like inner sense I create hold.
imoverit9,q4jngw,Your hair looks great! Not everyone's hair is meant to have defined curls and that is okay. Rock what you got it looks nice!
musicfromafar,q4jngw,"was your hair soaking wet ? wash with shampoo, and conditioner, and when your hair is still soaking wet, rake in some gel! Be heavy handed with the gel, and heavy handed with the water, that works for every texture"
ozmofasho,q4jngw,"Your hair looks good and healthy, but I understand that it's frustrating not to achieve the look you want."
the_onri,q4jngw,"I’m strongly co-signing this, if I may. A gel with strong hold is indeed all that you need to capture the definition of soaking wet curls (after shampooing and conditioning, of course).

If possible, dry with a handheld dryer + diffuser attachment, or a hooded dryer. This will speed up the overall drying process and help to minimize frizz."
No-Base8204,q4j4z4,"Which is better Giovanni Direct-Leave In or As I Am Long & Deluxe Leave-In?&&&I have tried Giovanni Direct and I used it with TGIN buttercream. They pair with together. They balance out.

I have low porosity hair so I'm looking for a product that won't sit on top of my hair yet is moisturizing.

Is As I Am the one I'm looking for? I check the ingredients list and it looks it is.

Has anyone tried the As I Am Long & Deluxe. I heard people didn't like the Original leave-in version."
happyhippoking,q4j4z4,I like them both as a low porosity natural. They're both lightweight and melt into the hair. They work really well to add moisture midweek. I think the As I Am is a bit more rich and a bit more heavy. It's really easy to reactivate the As I Am in the hair.
Kjnema,q4h8an,Your hair looks really pretty in those two ponytails so maybe make them into braids or space buns? You can also try a thick moisturiser and seal it in with gel. It really helps me anytime it becomes winter. Also try doing hair mask every two weeks (extra moisture)
coconutwall,q4h8an,help! what protective style would suit me the best? i moved to a new city where the air is super dry and it’s damaging my hair :( what do y’all recommend&&&
Love_Amethis,q4be5l,What’s your secret? It’s long. Also what are some of your fav products?
_charliezena,q4be5l,I am so happy how much my hair is growing since I started my natural Hair Journey!!! =)&&&&&&I have been avoiding heat and keeping it hydrated! (Putting water) basically treating it like a Plant! 🥰
