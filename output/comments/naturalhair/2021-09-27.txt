itaintchuck,q0x8k4,Are you juicing them or cooking them?

Delicious_Serve_5085,q0s82e,Using the shampoo and condition and No. 3 made my color treated hair way more manageable. There was a noticeable difference in my hair after I ran out of products. I would use only these products if it weren’t so expensive. The only drawback for me is the price
Parislareemcdonald,q0s82e,Has anyone used olapex? If so how you like it? I just picked some up&&&&&&Oh wow thanks! I didn’t know that. I’ll post results
curvyswag,q0s82e,I use No 0 and No 3 weekly. My hair is color treated….high lift blonde for over a year now and Olaplex is a staple.  I think people misuse Olaplex….it’s intended for color treated folks to help minimize damage. Let us know how you like it.
niquey321,q0s82e,"Olaplex is not just for people who dye… I use heat on my natural hair every couple weeks but would not say it’s severely heat damaged (still have all my curls). Olaplex is a must, I use it once a week (0,3,6, the oil). I feel 0 and 3 are the most important. The bonding cream and oil have silicones so be aware (I have no problems using them because I clarify them back out…).  These treatments help restore my curls in a way other treatments definitely do not. My hair is low porosity and doesn’t like protein right now. So a bond builder is perfect."
saffron25,q0s82e,I use 8 and I’m considering buying 3. I’ve been using 8 for three months and bought a new one a few days ago. My hair has been shiny and I notice my curls a lot more at the top . I recommend it

klutzy-tunes2136,q0jso2,My micro locs&&&
Brown_skin_fille,q0fuf4,Deep condition before installing them. Hydrating them every few days with water or choice of liquid and sealing with oil or butter. Also hydrate your scalp and massage lightly with oil
Knightt_Gal,q0fuf4,Oyin Handmade has an herbal hair tonic called juices and berries that I spray my twists with regularly. Leaves my twists super soft and moisturized.
iana_franks,q0fuf4,"I’m here for the comments… I’m having the same issue, it’s almost like my hair eats the moisture within 1 day, then back to being quite dry."
janaaydanielle,q0fuf4,How do you keep your 4c 2 strand twists moisturized?&&&Just as the title says :3 I've always struggled with keeping moisture in my scalp and my twists and I wanted to know if any of you have any tips on how you keep your scalp and twists moisturized :)
plzholdmyhand,q0fuf4,"Omg I just redid mine after 2 weeks by spraying leave-in conditioner and using an oil after then retwisting, doesn't look as great as what was done after wash day, but I really didn't want to wash it yet. I watched a couple of videos. Some people just washed them and retwisted, others use aloe vera juice instead of leave-in like I did. So take your pick I guess."
poochee_pansy,q0fuf4,"Spray. Store bought leave in spray, diluted leave in, or plain old water. Use that when the twists are in but before you install them make sure you use a leave in, and oil to the scalp if you want, too.

Also remember that dry hair doesn't necessarily mean *dry* hair — meaning that moisturized hair isn't only characterized by it being wet or damp all the time."
TheCultOfSolar,q0f6mz,Dread it up! It more than likely is gone b harder to detangle what’s alr dreaded anyway

answermanias,q0d4ue,What hairstyles are you doing? Is the majority of your hair dry in general?
ismololo,q0d4ue,"Damaged crown&&&The hair on the top of my head seem to be permanently damaged. I don’t straighten my hair that often - maybe 3-5x a year and I use a heat protector.
But lately the hair on my crown is always super course, dry, and has lost its curl pattern. 


Has anyone dealt with a similar issue? Does anyone know how I can rehabilitate this hair? 

Thank you in advance 🙏🏽&&&I forgot to say, my hair is not breaking from the crown, just that its damaged and lost its curl pattern.&&&Hi, I almost always have a low bun. The rest of my hair feels well hydrated and more smooth"
hibbertobsessed1096,q0cbnj,My hair looks like that and I’ve always been told/thought I had 4c hair
mtatripplanner,q0cbnj,Felt this
sheisthebeesknees,q0cbnj,"I don’t know my hair type and I’m tired of pretending that I know what’s going on?&&&&&&Now I am really confused. What does 4a and 4b look like?&&&I thought I was 4c with maybe medium porosity. 🙃🙃
I should have asked sooner"
shida206,q0cbnj,4A 4B
shy_perspective,q0cbnj,Looks like 4c low porosity
Twinklesuperpalm,q0by6t,This is me Blond! Do you think I will look better as a brunette Or even black hair?&&&
ESQ2020,q06e2v,"Type may be 4b instead of 4c 🤔🤔 but either way, it’s beautiful!!!"
Ear-hustlin85,q06e2v,I have to ask you......are those beats earbuds? If so can you tell me how long you had them and any issues you've had with them? I've been looking at a pair for workouts.
Skyoff_Lyfe,q06e2v,"really old twist out day before wash day; 4c hair&&&&&&came to my local ice cream parlor on this wonderful cheat day Saturday . . . and why can’t I take a “regular” photo lol . . . if my Mom asks for a photo of my hair these are the types of selfies she gets and she complains everytime 😂😂😂

this is when my hair is starting to give “Sideshow Bob” (from The Simpson’s) vibes, but wash day is tomorrow don’t roast me too much folks

I work out 5+ days a week, running and strength training in addition to allllllllll the meal prepping that goes on as well . . . so it’s giving “lazy hairstyling” during the week, OHKAYYYYY&&&thank you&&&Yes they’re Beats by Dre . . . I bought ‘em from Target, I looked at a bunch of reviews online and so I got ‘em and I still like ‘em

they work fine for me, I’m not the most tech savy person so as far as “noise canceling”, and bass and sound quality and all that-look Idk lol😂😂 I’m not trying to produce music or dj with ‘em it’s just casual for me . . but I got them earlier in the year and I haven’t had a problem, I’ve run outside in the rain (not a heavy rain though) and even when sweat is covering my body in the gym- and dripping from my hair and head still no problems . . so Idk if they got some water proof thing going on but yea I haven’t had 1 issue and they come with 3 pairs of replacement silicone ear tips

the only thing is if I run during the day and it’s a very sunny day after some time the heat from the sun will make them hot and they’ll cut off . . so I run on a treadmill during the day and run outside when the sun is going down&&&honestly I’ve been wearing wash n’ go’s ALOT lately I might take a selfie and post it soon 

. . . but 1. SheaMoisture coconut oil leave-in and SheaMoisture manuka honey and yogurt leave-in (both come in a spray bottle) with 2.ALOT of water and 3.my trustee Felicia Leatherwood detangling brush and that’s my day to day maintenance"

MissD34,q02s7q,"If your hairstyle is uncomfortable and causing you pain, yes take it out…especially if it’s something as simple as a high puff. Try it again but not as tight."
supermarketrat,q02s7q,"Should I take out my hairstyle?&&&I just finished putting my hair in a high puff for the first time ever and I’m unsure if I should take it out or not. It feels slightly tight around my head but this one part on the front of my head feels tight and hurts the most. I tried loosening the hair from under the band which alleviated some pain. Should I take it all out?&&&yeah, I took it out and redid it and it feels better now. thanks!"
Mylole,pzy4ma,Is it bad to wash your hair everyday?&&&And I’m not talking about shampoo and stuff I’m just talking about washing it with water in the shower. I know some people wear shower caps to keep their braids intact but I don’t style my hair so would there be any benefits of me wearing one?
Square_Raise_9291,pzy4ma,"If I don’t wet my hair everyday and put on a leave-in, it tangles really badly and I have more shedding and breakage. I also don’t like the way my hairs feels when I add products when it’s dry.  But everyone’s natural hair is different."
StonedKitten-420,pzy4ma,"I think you mean getting your hair wet, not washing it. When I had locks, I had wet my hair in the shower daily. I enjoyed the feeling. To each their own."
happyhippoking,pzy4ma,"It can be. Daily manipulation and daily water exposure can weaken the hair's cuticle over time causing more splits and roughness because the cuticle is elevated to the hair. Over moisturizing can cause weak, limp, noodle hair. Depending on your climate, the sun and dry air can cause the water to evaporate out of your hair if it's not sealed properly.

If I want to add moisture to my hair or reactivate product already in my hair, I'll let the steam do it's thing and lightly massage my hair and scalp with wet finger tips. Or I'll cup water in my hands and lightly drip it over dry parts."

All_naturale22,pzpr44,"Low porosity products&&&So I have a mixture of about 4B/4C hair that seems extremely low porosity I barely can soak it and it dries so quickly. The only time you can even see my curls is when I have shampoo or conditioner in because it’s also super frizzy. I can’t really use butters and creams because my hair flakes or even edge controllers it seems. Anybody else with this issue and found some solutions?

I could really use some products that are preferably black owned and more on the natural side that might actually work. I can’t tell y’all how much I’ve spent trying to find products that may work. Any suggestions would be great. TIA"
Blaque-Cat,pzpr44,"Low porosity hair still absorbs water and dries in a timely fashion. Hair with lots of buildup from products, dirt, and oils can’t get wet properly because of all the things coating the hair is blocking water out. How often do you shampoo, and with which kind? When was the last time you used clarifying shampoo?"
brchambers555,pzpr44,I use Mielle products but honestly I use a face steamer when I put leave in conditioner in. I’ve read that steamers can be damaging but my hair is so happy when I do. Otherwise products just sit on my hair.
CndyKsses,pzo7yi,"**As far as how long it'll take your hair to grow, it's up to nature to decide. Factors such as diet plays a huge role, maybe beyond your genetic lineage* 

Protective styling works, just don't neglect your hair while it's in that style.  Also don't be so quick to use a lot of product to make your hair slick because that can cause build-up and wear your hair down and then cause breakage.

If your nutrition is up to par, you can try incorporating an ayurvedic hair regimen. This can include: herbal hot oil treatments, herbal deep conditions, tea rinses (green and black tea for shedding). Herbal pastes that can possibly work, herbal hair spritz, incorporating chébé into your hair regimen. Natural shampoos like The Mane Choice (their detangler works wonders-it has multiple herbs in it including marshmallow root and slippery elm), soapnut or even Dr. Bronners castile soap."
JollyGoldDRogger,pzo7yi,"How Long Will It Take Me To Grow My Hair Out Long&&&I had a haircut about a 3 months ago and it was cut real low. The picture is my hair from a month ago. I've never had long hair my entire life and i really want to grow it out long, so i can have an afro/dreads.Any idea's on how long it would take to grow it out? And any tips to help maintain/help it grow faster?

I just wash it with natural shampoo and conditioner every 3/4 days on days i shower. I can try using more tea and herbal products if that helps it's health.  
I've been looking into getting a more detailed hair care regimen but thats all i've been doing for now."
Munchkin828,pzo7yi,"Monat is an MLM company that has many products that have made lots of people's hair fall out and cause extreme irritation to the scalp. Not to mention Said company has had a few class action lawsuits claiming these things. If u want to grow your hair look into finding products that have Biotin, and Keratin in them. But please stay away from Monat"
Pathtogreatness76,pzo7yi,Monat? What’s that?
RayofBeauty,pzo7yi,I started using Monat and my hair has grown long and thick
