Lovelynell4,c1iuma,"Spritz your hair with water in the morning and pick out with your fingers and a lite oil (like argan) or spray conditioner to the shape you want. You‚Äôll have to do that til your hair is long/big enough to be pineapple style wrapped up. Alternatively, you can twist your hair, bantu knot it, or flat twist before bed. Either way, you‚Äôll need to reshape every time you wake up or have your hair pressed on something. My hair isn‚Äôt short, but when in a fro or twist out, I have to be conscious to reshape again when i get out my car specifically."

keishaemery,c1iuma,"Prevent hair matting?&&&I don‚Äôt know if matting is the right term,
but I can‚Äôt think of another word for it. I have a short afro, but my hair is very very very thick. Whenever I sleep, my hair will press to my head (with or without a headscarf) this is annoying, and it looks bad and dries out whenever I get up. Is there a way to prevent this?

Also, I tried to wear a beanie today - and when I took it off I had the WORST HAT HAIR ever. It may have been a bit damp from my wash and go in the morning - but my hair shrunk so it was basically attached to my scalp. Perfectly smooth. I looked like an egg. Is there a way to prevent this also?? so frustrating"
namasteplantbased,c1iuma,"I get matting as well, it usually happens when:

* I haven't moisturized my hair in a few days.
* I am using a moisturizer that doesn't really work.¬†
* I didn't detangle my hair as thoroughly as I should have
* My hair isn't really really protected (covered with satin) before sleeping¬†

npbm2008,c1iuma,"This. 

I have a spray bottle with water and a few drops each of argan oil, Rose hip oil, and vitamin E oil. I  lightly spray my hair at least daily (when it‚Äôs not in a protective style), and pull it out with my hands and fingers. 

My hair reaches my bra strap when stretched, and it still does this. It isn‚Äôt a short hair thing, it‚Äôs a 4C thing."

I kinda miss it and would love to have a break from my natural hair. Only problem is for someone like me is I‚Äôm a passing white (but I‚Äôm mixed w black/ white/ all the other ethnicities) I‚Äôm just so scared to get my hair braided bc I don‚Äôt want to be bashed since people are so quick to assume things about someone. I would like to hear anyone‚Äôs opinion on this topic. Thank you :)&&&Yeah it does. I‚Äôve grown up more with my moms side which is black and I identify with that. I can relate to the memes and most topics in the black community (except of course the more serious issues that involve the color of my skin). My dad‚Äôs side is black too but I dont think he‚Äôs mixed bc I don‚Äôt see it in him. BUT since his mom was with a black man/ family he identifies as that too. I guess I just gotta get over the fact that I don‚Äôt want people side eyeing me for something they don‚Äôt know. I just want people to not be so quick to think I am doing something that doesn‚Äôt belong to me as well.

UnderSomeRock,c0yc1u,"Sounds like you have low porosity hair! It‚Äôs totally normal, and may require some TLC to properly moisturize it. What‚Äôs your typical routine, and what products are you using?

Some quick tips: 

(1) check the ingredients of your hair products with a site like isitcg.com to see how individual ingredients are classified (protein, humectant, alcohol, etc) 

(2) if you use heavy oils (such as coconut oil), which ‚Äúcoat‚Äù your hair strands, that may be preventing water from penetrating. Use a clarifying shampoo or clay mask in your routine

(3) use indirect heat when deep conditioning. (I really like [this](https://www.thermalhaircare.com/stellar-hot-head/) heat cap)

(4) low porosity hair can also be protein-sensitive&&&How to tell if your hair likes a product -- it's a mix of how it looks and feels. It also depends on what your hair goals are.

* Does your hair feel moisturized or dry?
* Does the product leave your hair feeling crunchy or does it leave white flakes in your hair?
* Does the product make your hair look frizzier then normal?
* Does a product give you more curl definition than normal?

Testing products -- totally feel ya on that front. 

* r/haircareexchange is available if you want to try to sell/ swap any products that don't work for you

UniquelyElle97,c01af8,"It‚Äôs not so much ‚Äúover washing‚Äù as it is being under moisturized.  What is considered washing hair too much varies from person to person based on factors like hair porosity & thickness.  The most important thing is keeping in moisture even if you wash often. Also washing with products that will not dry out your hair (ex sulfate free). You could also wash with conditioner or ‚Äúco wash‚Äù to revitalize hair or just rinse out daily. Again, keeping in moisture is the most important part and keeping your scalp not too dirty is also important."
Urikalynn_,c01af8,"I workout 5 times a week and I usually just do twist outs now so that way I can take it out on my own terms and I can wash my scalp dry my twist and have my fro when I‚Äôm going out.

sofia_52,c01af8,"Working out with Natural Hair?&&&Hi, I have 4c hair and recently I have been wearing crochets for a while (with cornrows underneath) because I struggle with one main problem with my hair being out -- working out.

I run track, which means I am outside a lot, and I live in a hot area. I'm constantly always sweating so obviously any style that I do will just shrink up back to my tiny afro (my hair is very short).

I've come to terms that it's hard for me to do styles because they just simply never last long enough for the amount of time I put in, and I'm still looking for easy styles that I can do where it won't be embarrassing when my hair changes during a work out, but the main thing is that I don't know how often I should wash my hair?

Obviously excessive sweat smells, especially with the products I put in my hair. Also, sweat just makes me itchy in general. I know over-washing natural hair is bad, but I workout/sweat about every day / every other day and not washing my hair just feels really bad.&&&That seems like a very nice idea.

RWHonreddit,bzwg4p,"I'm still early on in my process so I struggle with a lot. 
 
I also spend so much time detangling.  I've been adding a bit of oil on top of my conditioner to make it easier. But I've been considering buying that Felicia Leatherwood brush. 

I've heard such good things about it. So you might want to consider if that's an option for you. 

Naakie Nartey and queenykaay made videos about it. But there are many videos about it on YouTube"
RealEyez1RealLiez,bzwg4p,Do you really need to detangle so much? Just detangle once a week and still wash and condish in sections twice a week.
Sea_Soil,bzwg4p,"My hair is like tangle heaven due to my hair type. Super tight, tiny corkscrew coils it's like if you took a bunch of slinkies and smooshed and shook them up. To cut down on detangling I just cannot do wash and go's. If I wear my hair out and let it dry without stretching (in braids or twists) it literally tangles as it dries even without any manipulation. Using shampoo also will escalate the tangling. So I try to avoid it and just cowash. 

&#x200B;

My routine now is weekly, or once every two weeks in the summer when it's more moist. I thoroughly rinse with water, then separate into sections, 4 to 6 depending on the tangle-age. If I have buildup I will cleanse with black soap and follow up with an ACV rinse. Then use detangling conditioner going through each section with fingers, wide tooth comb and finally denman brush to remove all the shed hair (I can never remove 100% tho). After finishing the process and using the LOC method on my hair I put it into twists, and that's the key for me to reduce tangles as it dries because shrinkage/drying is what seems to create the most. So then even if I take my hair out the next day and wear it out for a while it won't tangle as much. The whole process is about 45 min- 1 hour. :)"
UnderSomeRock,bzwg4p,"When you wash your hair twice a week, do you use shampoo both times?

I personally only wash once a week, but I have tried a lot of different methods to cut down on detangling. The most effective method for me is to pre-poo (spray bottle filled with conditioner, water, and olive oil). I saturate and finger detangle section by section. Doing this really cuts down on time in the shower. When I‚Äôm in the shower, I finger detangle and use a comb. 

Also, when you were washing your hair twice a week, it‚Äôs possible your hair was becoming over-moisturized or needed more protein. (I‚Äôm not an expert,  I‚Äôve just been doing a lot of reading up lately to figure out my own hair and those are terms I‚Äôve seen a lot)"
blakchat,bzwg4p,"TO EVERYONE THAT WASHES HAIR MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK!!!&&&How do you do it? My hair, in general, starts getting dry and tangled 3 days after removing braids (I usually do braid outs on wash day). For a few weeks a couple years ago I would wash twice a week: add conditioner in 6 sections, lightly detangle and rinse, then add a bit of oil and braid. I'd wake up the next morning with soft, shiny curls! But I noticed, while it took less time than weekly wash days, it still wasnt that practical. I also felt like my hair was getting a little dry and like I was getting more split ends (but it grew a lot, I could tell). Another reason I stopped was due to the water bill lol(I did all this in the shower, with running water to help detangle).

One thing I've learned from that experience is that less really is more: now, I rinse with water and detangle with a really good conditioner, one with lots of slip AND moisturizing ability (usually you seem to get one or the other, but garnier whole blends works very well imo) and let it sit. Then I rinse thoroughly (some youtubers leave in a little conditioner, I like to rinse it all out), loosely twist in a few big sections and wrap my hair in a tshirt for an hour or so until its damp, then I add a tiny bit of leave in (no more than one or two products, usually one) to each section, braid, wake up to soft, shiny curls.

Detangling is always the worst. Even with all the slip in the world, it takes over an hour to do, and I'm usually so tired by the end that I need a break lol. 

I'd like to try doing my hair every 3 days again, but I dont like using so much water and detangling is a pain. How do you cut down on detangling time? I usually finger detangle, comb, then paddle brush to get all shed hairs out (and still I seem to miss some). 

Thoughts and tips? Wash n gos are a wash n no for me btw, they usually require much more time and product than 6 braids, and dont come out as nice&&&Oh, tips on wash n gos would be very helpful! I love Nap85's gel-less wash n go, but idk I can't seem to stretch it well when its dry because it meshes so much when I let it all out :(. I dont care for perfect definition, I just want to change my look up every once in a while and be easy breezy beautiful lol.

I dont use shampoo most times, rather I just rinse until the water runs fairly clear before adding conditioner and detangling. I dont have a problem with build up, and my hair never feels greasy from too much product. 

I should probably clarify: my braid outs last a week, I just notice the tangles really...solidifying on day 4. It doesnt feel that bad when I touch it on day 7, it's just lost its sheen, some softness, and the ssk are not fun lol. I've tried a lot of products, combos, methods, I think that's just how my hair is rn. It holds up better than it did a few years ago, and it's the healthiest it's ever been.

I've never liked changing the style mid week, it takes too long to work with it dry. Bunning and a satin scarf at night help a lot though.&&&No, I rarely shampoo. Usually just rinsing with warm water is enough. I usually dont detangle without wetting my hair in the shower because I need so much water T.T spray bottles aren't usually that effective for me, even with warm water, and it takes longer cause it dries quickly. 

I'll give it a try again though. Maybe adding conditioner will help a lot ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You may be right about overmoisturization, but I'm recalling that during that time it was unseasonably dry and cold, even my skin was ashy after using the thickest butters I could find.&&&Girl same üò≠ wash n go was always the goal, but it never seemed worth it after trying several times. For my thickness,  6 braids was just the easiest thing for me to do to get the best results. For twists, I'd have to do 18, so I usually just braid lol.

My detangling routine is the same lol, fingers, comb, then brush. Still takes me an hour or more, even with conditioners with great slip! Ugh, I dont even know anymore. Ssk are a pain, my ends are the worst and I'm just lost üò≠ idk how to really care for my ends more than I do&&&Hmm ü§î it feels weird to not detangle lol, but I'll give it a try!"
jobhuntquest,bzwg4p,"
I find detangling before washing helps. Saturating my hair with a cheap conditioner or a DIY detangler (water, glycerin & oil) and finger detangling takes me very little time. After getting all the shed hair out first, washing in 4-6 sections is a breeze. I use a cleansing conditioner (that has surfactants) midweek and not a shampoo. Keeps my hair soft, moisturized and less likely to tangle. 

I only wash midweek when I wear wash and gos. It‚Äôs not my intention to push them on you, but if you‚Äôre interested I‚Äôd be happy to share some tips and YouTube videos that improved my wash and go game. 


Also, since you say your hair gets dry after 3 days, have you evaluated your products? Maybe a more moisturizing shampoo, deep conditioner or styling product could help in retaining moisture. I can usually get 5-7 days out of a twistout with the right products. Or have you tried moisturizing and restyling midweek instead of a full wash day?"

DM me if you‚Äôd like links to pictures/ videos that I use for inspiration! My last message had 4, but they were removed because they were YouTube links.

Styles I use: 

Pinned Flat Twists

Cornrow Bun

Asymmetrical Twisted Crown

Flat Twist Knot Bun"
Wind_your_neck_in,bzn3sp,"The secret low bun. Part hair down the middle,then each half into 3. Make 4 twists from the two lower sections and the two middle sections. Pull the 4 twists into a low pony. The two sections at the front, should go from ear at the hairline to the crown with central part. Smooth or slick depending on preference the hair down towards your pony of twists and secure. You can either twists the ends and have a fully twisted pony/bun, or you can smooth the loose hair over the twists in the pony and make a bun.

I'm sorry I dont have a pick, but I hope the above is clear. I live in this style and do it on wet or damp hair on wash day. Because the hair is sectioned and set it's pretty easy to moisturize mid week"
blakchat,bzn3sp,"Another way to set type 4 curls&&&Hey guys, I'm type 4a/b curls, got a pretty good regimen down, but I'm looking at different ways to set my hair. 

For my thickness, 6 braids are perfect and I usually do that. However,  they aren't the cutest thing to wear out. Do you guys think it's possible to set my hair with a wet bun? I'm just thinking of ways I can a) stretch my hair, b) set my ends so they dont get too matted and c) maybe look a little cute while doing it lol.

Idk, I was just wondering. What do you guys think?

Edit: my mom said to just do a puff, let it curl on it's own. Which is good, but I was hoping for something that would protect my ends better.&&&Directions understood! That's very clever,  I'm trying it this weekend! Thanks so much üòÅ&&&Thank you! I just wish I was better at flat twisting or cornrowing üòñ idk, the curls always come out terrible,  kinda stringy and not the soft, fluffy, bouncy texture of a braid/twist out. Idk what I'm doing wrong, but I guess practice makes perfect?"
