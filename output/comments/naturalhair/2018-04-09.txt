25_timesthefine,8c0gvh,Mane Choice has a spray that you can use everyday to add moisture back to your hair. 
Awakeat5amagain,8c0gvh,"L. C.G method - apply Liquid moisturizer then a little Cream based moisturizer, followed by (gasp) a little hair grease. Your hair will be moisturized and sealed for days!"
BoxedBoobs,8c0gvh,What is your moisturizing routine like? What sort of climate do you live in? How do you wash and style your hair? What hair type is it? All of the answers to these questions will help people help you better.

HeyItsJenny,8bopu2,"I also have lo-po hair and it took me some time to figure out the moisture issues. It’s not perfect yet, but here’s what I do:

Washing: I do this every three days or so. I have scalp issues, so I need to shampoo twice a week. I actually use a clarifying shampoo when I wash because I find that the hair absorbs moisture better when it’s a clean slate. I use PURE by Made Beautiful Pureifying Cleanser. After shampooing, I apply the TRUE by Made Beautiful Intense Treatment Masque and let it sit while I finish showering (too lazy to deep condition outside of the shower). I finger detangle and rinse. Then I t-shirt dry and leave it wrapped in a t-shirt for at least 20 minutes to give the hair shaft time to absorb water. I notice that when I wait this long (or even a bit longer) the hair feels noticeably conditioned. 

Styling: After removing the t-shirt, I apply a leave in and let it sit for a few minutes to absorb. I use Design Essentials Almond and Avocado Detangling Leave‑In Conditioner. Detangle with a comb. Then, I use TRUE by Made Beautiful Hydrating Hair Butter to twist, although I’m sure you can simply apply it and style your hair as you wish. I use a denman brush to define the curls; that might be something to look into. I’m still working on finding a good sealer; my hair hates most oils but I’ve heard good things about sweet almond oil and grape seed oil. 

If anything, I recommend the by Made Beautiful product line. I get it at Walgreens, but apparently it’s sold at Walmart and other places as well. I’ve never had good luck with Shea Moisture. Lo-po hair does not do well with too many products/build up, so I would try to keep your routine as minimalist as possible. Be sure to sleep with a satin cap or a satin pillowcase and avoid caps, knit hats, anything that could zap moisture from your hair. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions and good luck!"
ladyabercrombie,8bopu2,"The issue with restoring moisture to Low Po hair is how to get the moisture to penetrate the hair shaft. Pretty much the only way to do that is to do it when your hair is wet. I would recommend a weekly, or while your hair is healing, bi-weekly hair masques geared at providing moisture. Since you like Shea Moisture, [this one](https://www.target.com/p/sheamoisture-174-community-commerce-manuka-honey-mafura-oil-intensive-hydration-hair-masque-12oz/-/A-15651079) is my favorite. 
I would also add a leave-in to your routine. Again, you need something to seal in the moisture once you've added it when the hair is wet. If you let it dry without a sealant, you've played yourself. The oil may not be enough to do this as it slides around.  "
rarekoolaid,8bopu2,"[Request] I need help with very dry low porosity hair.&&&Hello,
I'm a young male who recently decided to let my hair grow. I've let it grow for the last 3 months after years of cutting it low for 15 years. Although I've gained some decent length (almost 1 inch), my hair feels RIDICULOUSLY DRY and patchy.

A couple of factors that might have played a part in this:
1) I was using Castor Oil for the last 5-6 months.
2) I used to wear caps very often last year and they were very tight to my temples.
3) My family would tell me that I needed to shampoo and condition my hair every day... (which, I found out last year, wasn't the proper way to do things).

I also very recently learned that using Castor Oil was a problem because my hair has (is?) low porosity.

So, a week ago I bought some low porosity hair specific [Shea Moisture products](https://www.sheamoisture.com/products.html?product_collection=275) (and Sweet Almond Oil for extra moisture) to try dealing with it. My friend also suggested I get [this creme](https://www.carolsdaughter.com/marguerites-magic-restorative-cream/820645226227.html).

On top of this, I stopped wearing caps out a late last year to give my hair a better chance to breathe.

I'm pretty new to the hair care thing and I really want to at least make it to where I'm no longer disgusted by how dry and rough my hair feels. I'd also like for hair to not come out when I pick it. My hair isn't even a full inch yet!

Any help, tips, and/or guidance is appreciated :)

Edit: I'm also looking for tips on building a routine. Going from shampoo>condition>out (everyday) to a full on routine might be a bit confusing.&&&Thank you, I'll try to find the mask at my local hair supply store. Do you have any suggestions for sealant?
I've been doing a bit of research and found that olive oil and apricot are heavier (?) than the sweet almond but not as heavy as the castor. Do you think that would work?"

ObitoVZ,8bjgon,"My hair color was very light when I was young but now it is dark. Is there any way to make it light again?&&&It had a very light color but now it is almost black. Is there any way to make it light again? Not dying obviously because I want it to be my natural color as it was before. I've been told to put diluted lemon, but that's only temporary. 

&&&So there is no way to make it permanently? Like decreasing the melanin in hair or something"
_totallysafeforwork,8bjgon,The only way to make dark hair lighter is to bleach it or sun bleach it with lemon :/

KiNGXaV,8bc1tt,"Shape up/Line up&&&TL;DR - shape up before cornrows or line up after cornrows? 

Hey, I been avoiding haircuts just so my hair can grow. Literally looking all kinda ways (I would put water, less moisturizer than I needed according to my gf and pick out my hair and pay it down... if I had enough energy or motivation to do so) it's bad. 

My hair grew, not as fast as I would have liked but it grew, however the shape of my fro is uneven.

 I'm balding at the front on the right (20M) and the hair in the centre of my head (at the back, my sure but I think it's called the crown?) is growing slower than everywhere else so when I got to pick my hair out I have to pay it to make it look round. 

I felt I should give some info about myself. 

My question is:

I'm getting cornrows, should I get a shape up (risk of not being able to get cornrows if I do and I don't know any PROFESSIONAL barbers that can do it right and don't trust the ones available to me to do it in a way where they aren't removing a whole lotta progress -Montreal BTW) before I get the cornrows or should I just get a line up after I get "
