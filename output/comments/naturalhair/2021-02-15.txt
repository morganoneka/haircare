BajaBlaaasted,lpdv8g,"Unfortunately a big part of natural hair is trail and error. Personally shea moisture is not it for my thick coarse hair. Mielle, As i am, and Curls have products that work better for my hair. Try to find out your hair porosity, this is a major part of learning how to care for your hair, a quick YouTube search will provide the information you need just stay away from videos that mention the floating water test. After learning your hair porosity you should learn how your hair takes in moisture and then get an idea of how to retain moisture. Oils and deep conditioning is something you want to incorporate in your hair routine. I‚Äôll link some helpful videos below. [hair porosity ](https://youtu.be/HaAd8syyaOE) [Oils ](https://youtu.be/hLbAbrmwwak) [Hair Moisture/Retention ](https://youtu.be/ITKCAs3mi8A)"
NatrulV,lpdv8g,"As many others have suggested, try a different shampoo. One with a stronger surfactant, like sodium olefin sulfonate and others,  that can get rid of build up.  Coated hair is hard to keep moisturized.  Also, did you stretch out your strand against a tape measurer? Your hair may be a lot longer than you think.  Shrinkage can make it seem like our hair isn't growing when it is. Three inches shrunken is easily 6-7 inches straightened for tightly coiled hair."
Sshipwrecked,lpdv8g,I shared some information on [this previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Naturalhair/comments/lewng8/product_recommendation_for_men_with_graying_hair/gmtacxn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
Trikalnov,lpdv8g,"In need of help&&&&&&I cut of all my hair and went bald in April. This is nearly one year of growth. I have very thick, coarse (I call this 4Z) Nigerian hair. Its a struggle to comb, it grows thicker in the back than in the front. I want to be able to get amazing hair and do something with this messed up hair pattern of mine. It gets dirty quickly, and I‚Äôm tempted to wash two times a week at times. I use conditioner everyday, and wash once a week using shea moisture products. But nothing amazing seems to be going on. Any tips? I also trimmed it a bit in July.&&&I do attempt to finger comb, but my hair just looks like a mess if I do that. Also, wdym by stretch?&&&Wow, I cut mine bald around that time, and I‚Äôm only at 3 inches üòî&&&Funny enough, my hair seems to just soak up anything I throw at it. I conditioned and did a leave in condition as well this morning, and it soaked it up just well. And yeah, the measurements I gave was stretched hair beside measuring tape&&&I can‚Äôt seem to see the comments there"
almondmilkbrat,lpdv8g,"Do u stretch ur hair? On ur wash days after washing ur hair you should try cornrowing it or twisting or braiding it.  

Also, maybe ditch the comb. Try finger combing. But seriously, stretching ur hair will definitely help to make it more ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù 

I cut my hair (mix of 4b and 4c) on April 17th 2020 and I literally just throw my hair in cornrows and forget about it. I wash and deep condition once every 2 weeks and then put it back into cornrows. I spritz it with water and apply leave in it every 3 days

Edit: in April I cut all my hair off... into a buzz cut and now it is 4 1/2 inches"
lee_lee8,lpdv8g,"My hair's looser than yours (mostly 3c with a little 4a), but I'd like to help/give whatever tips I can. What kind of conditioner are you using everyday? I'm thinking that may be part of the reason if not the reason why your hair feels like it needs to be washed frequently. And what kind of Shea Moisture products are you using?

Edit: Also, if you haven't already, you should do a hair porosity test cause it affects a lot when it comes to moisture and how products work on your hair."
Zariajj86,lpdtsa,[f14] Aunt Jackies hair products&&&Hey! I have been natural all my life which really hasnt been a long time since im only 14 lol. After feeling inferior to white people and their hair textures I am now trying to embrace my curls more. I have a 3c/4a curl type I believe. I have been using Aunt Jackies religiously and Im not sure if the products are working. The shampoo made my scalp way drier than normal. Can anyone tell me if Aunt Jackies products are full of all safe chemicals so that I know that im using the right products?
denominare,lpdtsa,"Sometimes it takes a bit of trial and error. There are certain products that may be considered ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù types that will just not be for you, my hair hates coconut oil for example. 

If you had a bad reaction or feel like the aunt Jackie‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt right for you, you might want to try something else, it took years before I finally found a shampoo conditioner that works for me and it‚Äôs not a traditional curly girl product."
dmn661,lpdmq7,"My Hair is Thinning at 21- Any tips?&&&&&&lol I suck at reddit, I wrote a whole paragraph on reasons why an then when I uploaded the pictures it was removed idk why but heres a quick summary

* Been natural my whole life with thick 3b/3c curls
* Decided to flat iron my hair in  June 2016 for graduation ( did it twice back to back) and got severe heat damage , my hair grew back nicely and thick and full
* Heat free up until September 2020- decided to straighten my hair at a Dominican salon, all they did was wash it, condition it and blow dry and flat iron
* After washing I noticed slight heat damage and a burnt smell but nothing crazy (2016 was worse as my roots were straight)
* The next 5-6 washes I noticed my hair falling out in clumps ONLY in the back right section but only when I washed it and sometimes styling and the burnt smell was still there
* I then noticed that curls that were not heat damaged turned straight THEN starting breaking off to the entire back section of my hair ( the front was normal), scalp was more itchy, tender and flaking and somtimes burns randomly 
* Tried rice water and my hair became stronger for about 3 weeks but then starting breaking off again
* I noticed that the breaking has been moving up gradually and it starts by strands turning dead straight then slowly breaking off 
* It has been moving up to the middle of my hair, I cant even do half up half down because of how thin it looks
* No bald spots but just thin strands
* Important note: I came off of birth control right when this started so could be a reason
* I noticed that stress can be a factor and I have been stressed lately but I feel like Ive been more stressed in the past"
simmer_down-,lpdmq7,"I would stop using heat on your hair. Rice water can be a great source of protein for your hair but overuse can cause issues. I would recommend checking the hair products you use and see if there are any chemicals/additives that your hair is rejecting, doesn‚Äôt like, or have been proven to cause hair loss. I would implement hot oil treatments and use an oil that can stimulate hair growth. Trim the dead/split ends off to prevent it from spreading up your strands. Wrap you hair at night, sleeve with a scarf or silk pillow case. Good luck!"
DamaDeGatos,lpcjt3,"My immediate thought is that you want to shampoo your hair more than twice a month because in between those days, product is building up to the point that your hair cuticles are not absorbing anything. Product just sits on top of your hair after a while.

You're at the length where I imagine that shampooing once a week is feasible (doesn't take a whole day)? Clarifying shampoos once a month and regular shampoo the other weeks. Weekly or biweekly deep conditioning depending on your hair needs. And then continue with moisturizing in between washes as needed - if your hair is damp with water before you apply quality products, then you shouldn't need to apply conditioner every day, especially for your length."
didyousaypizza,lpcjt3,"Weekly/Monthly routine help&&&Been having trouble finding a decent routine. I've posted here a long while ago and gave up. I *think* my hair is 4c low porosity. My hair isn't long. Anout .5-1 inch long with some alfafa sprouts throughout my scalp. 
My routine as it stands is: 
Sunday: wash day. shampooing twice a month on this day. clay mask once a month on this day.  deep conditioning on this day weekly. 

monday-friday: daily moisturizer 
saturday: nothing

i should note that i'm using the shea moisture manuka honey and mafura oil line&&&I really hope for length. A full on crown, if you will.&&&Yeah. My hair is super short. The problem is, I'm not sure if I'm listening to my hair the right way. If it's dry, I throw moisturizer in it and keep it moving, but I feel like that's not enough?"
kyann-peppa,lpcjt3,What are your hair goals? Once you decide what you want for your hair establishing a routine will be a little easier.
Ecstatic_Ad_5593,lp9sw8,your hair is so nice I am kind of jealous: what do you use to grow your hair ?
vintagepop,lp9sw8,"Tried the LOC method for my high porosity hair (it's still damp) but definitely have a lot more definition! Very happy with the results&&&&&&Steps:

Conditioned and Detangled with my tangle teezer brush and Pantene curl perfection conditioner


Used garnier fructis leave in conditioner, Hollywood beauty vitamin e oil, and garnier fructis anti frizz soothing milk. Dried with a t shirt for abt 10 minutes then took out to air dry&&&I don't really use products to grow it specifically, I just use products to keep my hair healthy :) everything I use is in the comment above"

RoeInCustomerService,lp8lo7,I‚Äôm so jealous lol! I just started my natural hair journey. Hopefully one day my hair is a full and healthy as yours.
Sea_Ostrich4703,lp8lo7,"I am literally blow drying my hair every time I wash (one a week, as I run daily weekly washes are best for me since so much sweat is accumulated daily)  just so it‚Äôs easy to do cornrows for my wigs otherwise I can‚Äôt cope. How else can I get around not using hair dryer when wanting to do cornrows neatly. I haven‚Äôt relaxed in a year and this weekend just gone I cut all the relaxed her. Trying to keep the journey simple and minimalist as possible with products too. So I only use aussie moist shampoo and conditioner (bit pricey as my hair drinks the conditioner) and avocado oil. Nothing more and it seems to be working fine. It‚Äôs just the dryer that‚Äôs my problem üôàüôà"

When I blow dry my hair, I can really tell what parts need to be trimmed and it‚Äôs probably close to like 2.5 inches at this point üòû&&&Hahahah! I wash my hair every two weeks, and moisturize/seal/twist once a week (using coconut oil, coconut cream leave in, and eco styler gel).

Laptaw,loui7i,"My hair is about that length and I agree that just keeping it moisturized works well. It‚Äôs an awkward length to style but easy to just wear out.

If I‚Äôm feeling the ol razzle dazzle, I‚Äôll use a denman brush with some gel"
Super_Ad_3294,loui7i,Any suggestions on what l can with this length and what looks Good on me?&&&
WorthyLocks,loui7i,"comb twists, denman brushing with gel, even a slick down might be an interesting attempt.  But I'm the adventurous type when it comes to styling.  If it sucks, you can just rewet and start again.  lol"
plant_daddy_,loui7i,Small twist or coils. Honestly just keeping it moisturized is good enough too. Doing good so far

LovesGG,lon0y5,"I got this one a couple months ago. Secure (I toss a lot), lots of room, and a good material. I sleep with white sheets and pillow cases, no transfer. It's a little over your price preference but I think worth it.

StellaDarling8677,lon0y5,Maybe someone on Etsy can customize one for you.
WorthyLocks,lon0y5,"Thanks for the suggestion!  I sleep in scarves and have finally learned how to keep them on but now that my hair is getting longer, it really squishes my curls :("
femaleminority,lon0y5,"Same! I always look for the size ‚Äúsuper jumbo.‚ÄùThey cost me around $5. 

Pro tip: super jumbo shower caps also exist."
flirtandflutter,lon0y5,"Do you have any beauty supply stores by you? I've found a couple of really large ones in those....and much cheaper than 10 dollars, more like 3 or 4 dollars. Just look for xxlarge in the bonnet section."
hanap8127,lon0y5, Check Walmart
vintagepop,lon0y5,"Can anyone recommend a good large sleeping bonnet?&&&I would love to hear your recommendations! The one I have now is too small and squashes my curls and I would like one that is big for all my hair but also is secure. I've looked all over Amazon but apparently they all transfer color to pillows which isn't what I'd want at all. If you could I would like one under $10 if possible :)&&&Oh that's a great idea, thanks!"
