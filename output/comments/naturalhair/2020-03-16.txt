EloquentElixir,fn9ltz,"Theres a great combination of natural products I use: 4Z's all natural ayurvedic shampoo, christina moss peppermint conditioner, various natural oils (Apricot kernel, avocado, olive, coconut, jojoba, sweet almond, castor), jesssicurls lavender deep conditioner, buttabutta cream, Acure curiously clarifying shampoo and a few others but theyre not 100% natural...you might want to double check the ingredients on some of these, but I love these products so much."
HandMadeDinosaur,fn9ltz,I like Kinky Curly and Mielle!
Kcvexo,fn9ltz,"Eden body works scalp cleanser papayas castor(5/5)
Eden body works almond and marshmallow split end masque(4/5)
Kinky curly leave in (3.5/5)
Tahluah waajid curly cream (3.5/5)
I'm also trying the Carol's daughter coco creme --we will se how this goes
I also heard the african pride prepoo is good but I haven't tried it. Only $4
I have extremely difficult natural hair and I dont like many products. I just cut off 6-8 inches of my hair and I'm think of cutting off more so I can start fresh."

atctia,fn9ltz,"I swear by Mielle products, especially the honey and pomegranate line"
coilyflowers,fn9ltz,Yea they did 😭 I was able to get a few left over leave ins from my tjmaxx and local beauty supply tho
lauvan26,fn9ltz,I used to use the Shea Moisture’s low porosity line but they discontinued it 😢&&&I found a replacement leave in for my Shea  Moisture low porosity leave in! Tgin Green Tea Super Moist Leave  In conditioner. It’s been good so far. I hope it continues to work for me.
lovergirlaw,fn9ltz,Mielle organics twisting souflee has always been amazing on my type 4 low porosity hair. Right now I am trying out this Black owned all natural brand called Sunny in Denbigh. Check her out on IG!
monica106,fn9ltz,"Best products for low porosity and protein sensitive hair?&&&So I big chopped almost 7 months ago and majority of the time I had my hair in braids but now I’ve recently taken them out and want to start wearing my hair natural but I want to try new products. Right now all the products I use do not have protein in them and I’d prefer it stay that way. I used rice water whenever I feel like I need some protein. What products (shampoo, conditioners, deep conditioners, styling products for wash n gos, etc.) do y’all suggest I use? I prefer all natural products btw if you know any. Also I shampoo and deep condition once a week and believe I am 4a/b."
BeignetsNSugar,fn690k,I didn’t like the one I had. I had crazy split ends after the one time i used it.
zawarudourien,fn690k,"What do you guys think of steam straighteners?&&&From you experience, how are they? Do they still  provoke heat damage?"
freestyle45,fn1m5z,"natural Deep conditioner recommendations&&&I'm looking for a product that's similar to NaturALL Club.  I like their brand and I'm sure their product is good but I can't stomach paying $9 for a 2 oz pack of conditioner.  My hair is 4c, dense, and armpit length, so I'd want a little more for my money. 

Anyone have any suggestions? Ideally protein-free, fragrance free?"
simsnspecs,fn1f7n,White mother who has pushed for natural hair&&&[removed]
Ample-sauce,fmqq4v,😍 wow. Can you give us details?
HandMadeDinosaur,fmqq4v,So defined! What type of hair do you have?
Jasvia,fmqq4v,Very pretty
SeminoleDollxx,fmqq4v,"Very beautiful 

Your curls look very healthy with great strong ends"
angelnamedtia,fmqq4v,"Wash n go💛&&&&&&I did a big trim two weeks before this style. I like long hair but my goal is happy hair and ends lol&&&Thank you! And I'm not wearing any foundation. Just highlight on my brow bone, check bone and nose 😆&&&Thank you. I've never heard someone say that before😭&&&1) Sometimes I pre-poo with grapeseed oil ($4 at aldi). If I have gel on my hair, I skip this step. 

2) I wash and condition in 4 sections with Renpure coconut cream conditioner and shampoo. ( $7 dollars each) These bottles are huge and they have lasted me since November and they are still half way full. It's an all natural line that my curls love. 

3) I detangle my hair let my conditioner sit under a plastic bag lol under a hooded drier for 30 minutes (I have low porosity hair)

4) After thirty minutes, I rinse it out and immediately add Jamican mango and lime coconut milk and honey deep conditioning hair marque ($6) into 4 sections. I finish taking my shower and put a plastic cap on again. I sit under the hooded drier for 15 minutes. That's the time the instructions on the deep conditioner suggests and I don't want to over moisturize my hair and lose shrinkage. 

5) I rinse out the deep conditioner (it isn't a deep conditioning hair marque that is super moisturizing when you put it on BUT omg when I rinse it out, my hair feels so silky!) 

6) I wrap my hair in a t-shirt for 30 minutes. Like I said before , I'm low p so my hair styles best when it's damp

7) I take the t-shirt off and just play with my hair lol because it's so soft at that point. 

8) in sections, I apply lotta body hair milk ($3), grapeseed oil, lightly spray WARM water to open up my cuticle so the product will penetrate (i boil water and pour it in a thermal cup and I put a spray bottle inside. It doesn't melt and it keeps my water warm between sections) and xtreme wetline gel (just a little bit & it's $4)

9) I don't do anything fancy, I just finger detangle the section and detangle good with a wide tooth comb and finger my curls again to clump them together and I leave it alone. I hate shringleling so much lol. The purpose of a wash n go for me is to not spend an hour and thirty minutes on my hair. At this point my hair is black and doesn't have a white film because I used small amounts of products and they penetrated my hair strands properly. 

10) I do this to every sections and I sit under my hooded drier for an hour on low heat. You can skip this if you like to air dry. 

11) once my hair is dry, I break the film cast from the gel with grapeseed oil. I use the banding method to stretch my curls and I put on a satin scarf. 

12) the next morning, I take it all down, spray my scalp with water where my hair isn't falling and I shake it with the pads of my fingers. I pick the roots a little and I'm done :)

This style last allllll the way until my next wash day which is a week and it looks like I could go another 3 days with it :-) 

Make sure to test your hair porosity so you can use products and techniques that benefit your hair. 

All in all, my products cost $30 and they are my favorites! Find what works best for YOUR hair and don't fall for the product junkie mentality. Most of the products you see on the shelf that are popular, don't actually do much for different hair types (porosity, density and thickness)&&&I posted it in this thread :)&&&La colors lip gloss in ""Lavish""&&&Low porosity, high density and thick strands :)"
likewhaa,fmqq4v,Product list and routine please. Your curls look so defined and shiny!
mromain1,fmqq4v,"Not hair related, but what lip are you wearing? It's so pretty."
notgugubela,fmqq4v,Wow your curls are so unique ✨
sourparchesx,fmqq4v,Sis what foundation you use? Your skin is flawless.
EloquentElixir,fmps9g,"Also remember, its all just recommendations! If high porosity products work for you, go for it. Try different things and see what works for /you/. I have 4c low porosity and I use heavy butters along with lighter products :3

Its just a dance really!"
angelnamedtia,fmps9g,"Are you applying products with warm water? Working on damp hair? Washing with shampoo and not just co-washing? If the products don't work, listen to your hair :)"
laniemel,fmps9g,"Low porosity hair but my hair doesn’t like low porosity products.&&&I did the porosity water test a couple of time and it seems to be low porosity. I’ve been trying low porosity products but my hair has never been as moisturized as it was when I was using high porosity thick butters. 

What should I do?"
Awkward_Sort,fmo9nv,"Natural Hair Product Recommendation&&&Hey all! Like you, I know that having curly hair is overwhelming, expensive and downright complicated. So I created a database where we can aggregate our hair characteristics and product recs all in one place.

I'd also love your feedback on how to improve this. My goal is to build out a search engine where people can easily search for products

I'll check it out! How did you hear about this product? I've never heard of it"
DanaKey,fmo9nv,Awesome. I'd suggest you give a try to Elin Bianco treatment line. I'm using it more than 5 years and it really works on matural hair. Don't forget to thank my after your first use :-)
EloquentElixir,fmo9nv,"4Z's natural ayurvedic line is great to try out! Only a few ingredients per product and it works wonderfully! Unfortunately for me, I have a sensitive scalp and something about her conditioners seem to irritate it, but my hair loves it.... weird situation 

I can and do use the shampoo though! It's very moisturizing and cleans my hair effectively :3

Really want to try her other stuff, but I have a holy grail rn so I'm not too eager to try anything new atm"
itsmebroskies,fmg7qx,"My roots went frizzy after braids? PLEASE help??&&&Hello fellow naturals! So I have 4a-b hair and a few months ago I got braids with extensions and I left them in for 2-3 months (too long but I was busy w exams) and after I took them out my roots and a few more centimeters (VERY noticeable) have been SO undefined and frizzy? Like just straight and frizzy? And they’ve been like that for about 2 months and nothing I’m doing has been helping and idk what to do? I tried coconut oil twice, ( first time worked a tiny bit but didn’t the second time) a natural honey, olive oil, and avocado mask and even a garlic mask. The only thing that seems to help is leave in conditioner with gel and even then it’s not great and doesn’t stay for long. PLEASE help me curly babies.. idk what to do.. :(&&&What a protein treatment?&&&Oh sorry, the garlic mask I used was an oil treatment"
leadsinlight1,fmg7qx,Consider a protein treatment
sps2011,fmg7qx,Maybe a hot oil treatment instead of mask. Or cherry Lola treatment
DaniMrynn,fmelpd,"If anyone is in the UK and wants to try Mielle products, Kiyo Beauty's website has them on sale as well."

tempuser123455789,fmelpd,Was anybody seriously buying that varsity jacket?
A2elsia,fm6g05,"Right!!!?? 
I see so many naturals that have braids with volume but mines be limp as can be 😭😭😭
I don’t understand."
BlaqMeat,fm6g05,Your hair is beautiful.🙌🏾
Embarrassed_Cow,fm6g05,my hair isnt  long but its so thick and large but when i do the same braid it all disapears and I get like one tiny stringy braid.
MuffinPuff,fm6g05,"I saw a method on YT or some gif that uses fanning to give braids fullness. They essentially grip the broadest parts of the braid and gently pull outwards, starting from the top and working your way down. Search braid fanning or pancake braids (I tried to link to a short vid, but apparently automod doesn't like that)"
WhildChild,fm6g05,Wishing my braids would get the volume memo 🙃&&&&&&Thanks so much!!!&&&I’ll have to give that a try next time
atctia,fm6g05,I've got medium density hair and I avoid box braids for this very reason
blackpino,fm6g05,I bet if you wet it your braid would look hella thick!  Of course there would be shrinkage involved lol.
lonelyplantain,fm6g05,Oh my god we are on the same page I dont understand how such a big thing becomes so thin!
mmiliona,fm6g05,Your natural hair is GORGEOUS.  You carry a CROWN OF GLORY
monaleee,fm6g05,"Honestly, same."
itsinesvieira,fm5edl,"Carob oil&&&Hello Naturals,

I dont know if all y’all are aware of carob oil (carob is a legume predominant around the mediterranean and it seems to have health benefits overall). I got some carob oil extract, that I have been using on my face - at night before going to sleep. 

And I was wondering, if it has any benefits for the hair... 

If any of you know about it and knows how it can be used, let me know - even if its not for the the hair.

Stay hydrated, healthy and keep deep conditioning ;)"
HandMadeDinosaur,fm36ls,I would try a heat cap but I have the Q Redew and it works pretty great!
icatchflyingsaucers,fm36ls,"Handheld Steamer recommendations&&&My stylist recommended that I steam my hair while I deep condition it. I don’t have space for anything other than a handheld steamer. The Q-Redew seems to be popular, but I’ve also heard of people using a fabric steamer. Is that even safe? And if you steam your hair, what do you use?

Thanks!

Edit: I heard that using a fabric steamer is really bad for your hair. Is there anything out there other than the Q-Redew?"
mooshu1x2,fm36ls,Why not a heat cap? You can find them on Amazon.
