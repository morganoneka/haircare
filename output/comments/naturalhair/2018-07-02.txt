Midnight_Moon29,8x5cw7,"Hi there, I'm also 4c, so I can relate in some ways. I'm sorry about the scalp psoriasis, that must make things so much more difficult. I know you didn't ask about this, but are you using hair products  or have you been prescribed something by your doctor that is specifically for psoriasis? Maybe something prescribed would give you more relief.

The protective style I like (and the only one I've learned so far lol) is called a twisted crown. I'm not sure if we can post links, so I'll check that and then edit later. Hope this helps!"
fefelala,8x5cw7,4c 18 month natural here. I can't do anything to my hair myself. I got it dyed light brown so I wouldn't be tempted to relax again. My problem is I have terrible terrible horrible scalp psoriasis and I desperately need some ideas for protective styles that won't aggravate my condition.&&&&&&Yes I use a serum on my scalp after my shampoo that was prescribed by my dermatologist. The problem is it's summer now and it sweats right off. I'm going to Google this style and see if it is something I can do. Thanks for the suggestion!
Justpick_aname,8x4yqm,"Do any 4c naturals prefer to wear their hair straight? If so, could you please share your methods.&&&&&&> hatchet dryer

I'll look into that, thank you!&&&Thank you for your response! Our hair is so much work I think she has a personality of her own lmao"
bdd4,8x4yqm,"I do not prefer to wear my hair straight, but I have a skin thing and I need to wear it straight to easily tend to my scalp.

quaglady,8x4yqm,"I used to press my hair all the time. I'd wash/cowash and dry/straighten with a hatchet dryer, then style/finish with a flat iron on high. A hatchet dryer is my go to tool."
Midnight_Moon29,8x4twe,"[UPDATE] What is your opinion on the hair product 'Gorilla Snot' and why?&&&This is an update to a previous post. Most people ridiculed me for my  thoughts on this product. Even though I knew my perspective was a silly, I still wanted to share it because I thought I might change my mind by talking with others. And it did! I don't feel the same way about this as I originally did, and after trying it, it didn't really hold my 4c ends that well lol. Thanks to those of you who had kind words."
avocadochick,8x4twe,I don't really like it much.  It flakes and doesn't hold my edges well. I have a whole tube left though so I'm going to use it but I wouldn't buy it again.
bbcreampapapa,8x4twe,Tried it for my wash n go and hated it. 
that_girl_there409,8x4twe,"I've tried Gorilla Snot, as well as the Creme of Nature's version and I hate them both. They flaked so badly in my hair. At first, I thought maybe it was the products that I was using in my hair (leave-in, oils, etc.) reacting with the gel. I tried it with just Creme of Nature products, without the products, after washing and conditioning, without conditioning and it just snows everywhere. Issa no for me."
CylverR,8x48t6,"Hair growth method&&&Hello everyone, recently a girl who’s in school for hair told me her teacher gave this method to the class!

Get oil + massage on scalp(every 3 or 4 weeks)
Wash hair after 2 months
Repeat! 

Anyone ever tried this? "
DegreeDubs,8x48t6,What kind of oil?
Riversongbluebox,8x48t6,"I use no chemicals, no heat, and try keeping my hands out of it.  For growth, i used Jamaican black castor oil and wild growth oil a couple times a week. I hydrate my low porosity hair with  water daily. When I experience breakage, I use tea rinses with a few drops of tea trea oil. This has helped greatly. I have yet to use the rice water method, although I know a few with success. 

Different oils work for different grades of hair. Coconut oil may not work for some, and olive oil may not work for others, etc. I personally use EVOO as part of my pre-poo process.  Massage the scalp. 

Hydration seems to be key-in and out. B12, eating right doesn't harm either for healthy hair.  Trim. If i see unhealthy ends-they leave. I refuse to keep tgem any longer. Now my hair grows. It just takes time. 

And a lot of practice. 

And a lot of arm strength. 😭 lol  "
ychirea1,8x48t6,"This works if you keep a braided style and let it out a few times after the oil massage. Apparently some hair loves to have rest, loves to be left alone. After a big chop I did this with a clarifying wash every four weeks, then braid, repeat. I got about six inches of growth with 4b hair in three months, 8 inches by the end of a year. NO chemicals, no heat."

holdinga0,8we2m8,"Has anyone else tried lightening hair with ACV rinse?&&&I did an ACV rinse last month and noticed my hair seems to be tinted a burgundy shade at the ends. I've tried to find out if anyone else has noticed this with ACV, I suspect that my hair is looking that way because of the ACV but I'm not completely sure. I was trying out ways to lighten my hair with more natural things. I like the color but it's not very noticeable, if I was to do this a second time would it be damaging in any way? Maybe drying? "
ladyAnder,8we2m8,"I use ACV quite a bit as I use it to wash my hair between shampooing.  I can't say it's lightened my hair visibly. In the sun light, looking at my strands, my hair is more reddish brown than it was when I was younger. Granted I don't know if that's the vinegar or my using henna. Probably a bit of both.

I use ACV to wash because it doesn't strip my hair. I don't use shampoo unless I have to. It really depends on the products I'm using. Shampoos tends to strip my hair or make it crispy. As long as you don't over do it, so no worries about it damaging your hair if you keep the solution diluted with distilled water, don't keep it on for too long, and condition your hair afterwards. 

As for lightening your hair naturally. I've never found anything that actually worked. Black hair is just too dark to lighten with natural things. The only thing that kind of worked for me was cinnamon. I did it because I wanted a red henna dye to pop a little more. I did a little but not a dramatically as I wanted.

However, I think something more effective and less harsh. You might just want to use peroxide and follow it up with a good deep conditioning.

BoxedBoobs,8w2stw,"I didn’t know we had these discussion threads! I was wondering how this sub feels are creating guidelines for when people post asking questions. Our sidebar isn’t the most robust, so I understand folks coming here asking what seems to be the same stuff over and over again, but rarely do they post details about their current haircare regimen. Maybe we can have some posting guidelines that say something like “in order to help you better please let us know your current haircare routine”. Thoughts? I think this sub could be a really rich resource but we just gotta organize a bit. "

jeylo369,8w2stw,"How do you all feel about the “more expensive it is, the better the product” cliché when it comes to natural hair care products ?"
lulumajorca,8w2stw,I need some truly honest opinions on the smell of fermented rice water. I've heard amazing things about it but bad smells truly offend me and I don't know if I can handle it.
misszoeline,8w2stw,"I think more structure would be a good idea, kind of similar to r/curlyhair but maybe with not so many “hair victory tag but I really just want to brag” type of posts. 👀&&&I don’t buy into it. More expensive can mean higher-quality ingredients, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it works better for your hair. Plus, everyone’s hair is different, so unless it’s expensive because it’s personally formulated for your hair, there’s no guarantee that any particular product will work better than a cheaper version. When I first went natural, I tried a few of the more expensive items that had a lot of hype behind them, and they were nothing special to me. Now I mostly use homemade products and Cantu brand products, and my hair is happy with the routine that I’ve worked out. "
xviore,8w2stw,"(Tried searching to make sure my question wasn’t already asked but I’m super new to reddit so my bad if it has been. )

I got an under cut (shaved sides + back) and I’m currently growing it out. The shortest parts are approx. 2in. Can I get faux locs without them slipping out? I’d be using the crochet method (braiding my hair, crocheting the marley hair at the top and then wrapping it down, covering the braid with my hair inside) 

Impossible? Lmao

Riversongbluebox,8vzkwg,"I've seen a couple of pin up styles on naturals and I was in love! I love the pin up look. Its so classic. Problem is, theyre so far and few in between on Youtube/Pinterest but they're present.  "
SailorShinyUmbreon,8vzkwg,"Also have the same issue :( the dearth of styles on untreated natural hair in wedding photos is immensely frustrating. Basically what I’ve done so far has been going to YouTube and watching those “10 _____ (insert whatever word you like) styles for natural hair” videos and just taking screenshots of the ones I like. But yea, it’s really annoying."
Tarfa212,8vzkwg,"I went through this last year. Looked at tons of pics on offbeat brides. Ended up finding a sparkly comb I liked and decided that wedding day I was going to get up, do my hair like normal and stick that rhinestone thing in and get married. Don't stress out. People worried me about how I was gonna wear my hair. Day of no one cares. It was fine and I still love my pictures. "
Weaselpanties,8vzkwg,"Saaaame! I'm getting married next August and I don't know what to do with my very thick, unruly 3b/c hair. It's medium-length right now, growing out from a buzzcut two years ago. I loved it when it was in the ""wild fro"" stage, but now it's long enough that it hangs down more. I was thinking maybe twists or braids on the side, perhaps with silk flowers or pearls woven in, and leaving it loose in back?

My hair type is 3c (I have some spots that lean more towards 4 a though) and I CAN'T find a decent looking wedding hairstyle that isn't:

1. On very very straight/wavy/curly hair, that is ya know, just very not ethnic
2. Weave
3. Relaxed
4. Super short 4C hair that rlly hasn't anything done to it besides a hairpin and 3 flowers
4. A birdnest on a head

progretivity,8vzkwg,"Have you tried Youtube? I got a lot of my formal hairstyle ideas from natural hair gurus. And they are usually styles that can work on any curly pattern. Instead of focusing on the curly pattern for your styles, look stuff for your length."

JadeStew,8vux7n,"Avoid anything with protein in it like the plague. Sheamoisture has a shampoo for low porosity hair that gently  clarifies and makes it easier for your hair to absorb moisture. It's a lifesaver, and smells good too. It's a bottle with an orange label. Also, Lush's R&B hair moisturizer is super conditioning and will have you smelling like a goddess. "
LadyLAJ,8vux7n,I watch YouTube all the time.  My favorites are Naptural85 and Glamtwinz.  
WetMouseKA,8vux7n,"Can't stop, won't stop lol&&&I have thick thick coarse 4c hair and I know when people say their hair is thick and it's not but I had a perm once that didn't take when I was natural for half a year and went back to perms... and I've been at this salon since I was a child and this happened in college. I've been natural for about 7 years now  (under wigs) but the last year I've been wearing my hair out and I'm sooooo blah about it and I need help. All I do everyday is high puff....and my hair isn't that long to begin with not to mention my edges getting snatched out when I got my final weave ever (not from the salon went to a friend smh) anyway I need some help guys

1. A new wash regimen
2. Help with curl definition and how to keep it from looking dry halfway through the day
3. ANY OTHER STYLE BESIDES FROHAWK AND HIGH PUFF lol

rnountdiablo,8vux7n,"For styling, I recommend mini twists with no added hair. I've been doing those since September last year, and have retained so much length! The style has cut my time in half; I just dedicate 2hrs every two weeks to washing and re-twisting (it's the twisting that takes me so long!). It's also much easier to reach your scalp this way, if you want to oil it or anything else.

I'm 4C and at apl btw. "
Blessedchild18,8vtftg,I have a question. In a couple of weeks I leave for bootcamp and I have no idea of how to care for my hair while im there. I cut it yesterday into a small afro but I'll grow some while I'm there and I'm not sure what to do with it other than continue cutting it. What do y'all recommend? I don't know how to braid but I'm trying to get better at that. 
BonnJord,8vsbd7,"Hair oils&&&I’m not new to the natural community but the act of being more aware of my products is. My natural is no heat, perms/chemicals to alter your hair type. Over time, my hair hasn’t grown much but it’s thick and gets a lot breakage. I assumed it’s because the lack of kept moisture. Wash days and the day following is typically when my hair keeps that moisture. I’ve been on edge about oils because products already have a hard time penetrating my shafts but I’ve been seeing that oils are key to retaining moisture. What oils? I have 4c hair and feel that coconut oil doesn’t help my hair. I’ve been between olive oil and safflower oil. The results I get with hot oil treatments and adding them to conditioners has been much better than coconut but my hair still struggles to stay moisturized. Help me out! Which oils do you all use for low porosity hair? When in your routine do you use it? Do you have a routine? *find out on the next episode of dragon ball z* just kidding but I need help ladies and gents. &&&Thanks. Do you use a daily moisture too? Your hair sounds a lot like mine. &&&When you do your daily moisturizing, do you use solely water or add more of a certain product? I also have sensitive skin/ scalp so I have to be cautious with products.&&&Thank you ! I’m going to try this. I use raw shea butter for my skin. I was unaware of the hair moisturizing aspect. "
KayyxKayy,8vsbd7,"What I’ve found that works is the LOC method, but a little reversed so I guess LCO, I first apply heavily some water and rake it through. It takes a couple minutes for water to be absorbed into the hair shaft for me so once my hair is damp I apply a light conditioner. Something by creme of nature or something handmaid works wonders for the hair. This makes it easier to detangle. Although oil is great to use in a routine it’s not the key to moisturizing. All it does is help retain moisture. I also struggle with using coconut oil it doesn’t work... but I’ve found avocado, olive oil and Argan oils are GREAT! Avocado oil goes on so smooth it’s crazy. But if you’re not too into dousing your hair with oil-especially in the summer then try finding products with it already infused with it :)

Hope this helps!&&&Umm I wouldn’t say daily because I try not to manipulate my hair too much (I get hair happy) lol. But at least every day I try to add water and just rub it into my scalp. But every other day I spray this revitalizer in (searching for a new one) that I made, where it’s my favorite conditioner, water, avocado oil, and olive oil. I spray it on and let it sit in my hair for about an hour and wash it out with cold water. Or you could leave it in. I haven’t tried it that way yet though !"
Smartista95,8vsbd7,Try castor oil and when you deep condition your hair use a steamer 
frumiouswinter,8vsbd7,"the oils that work the best on my type four hair are olive oil, avocado oil, jamaican black castor oil and jojoba oil, but my holy grail for retaining moisture is shea butter. i mix a little oil with some shea butter and use it after my leave-in. "
miniursula13,8vsbd7,"I’m pretty sure I have low porosity 4c hair.  I think that there are many products that can work, but what’s more important is the routine and how your hair is responding everything.  


For retaining length, the number one thing that helped my hair grow was keeping it in cornrows.  I would have my hair cornrowed, and wear wigs for a couple months, and that hands off method helped my hair grow long and healthy with zero breakage.  


When wearing my natural hair out, I like simplicity.  I have a spray bottle of water that is my go to for moisture.  I also have tons of shrinkage, so I try to moisturize my hair while I’m styling it so I don’t have to moisturize too much when it’s in its styled state.  But I do know my hair needs lots of moisture so I do spritz it daily, I just vary the amount.  

I have found my hair likes glycerin, so for me, another moisture filled product is the curl activator. It’s not very expensive, lasts a long time, and leaves my hair feeling soft.  

My hair likes thick products, so for right now, my leave in conditioner is the Cantu leave in conditioner.  I also BB’s oil moisturizer hair lotion with Castor oil and aloe vera.  Both of which help to moisturize my hair.  

As for sealing the products in, I’ve been really lax about putting an oil on top.  My favorite is argon oil, or sometimes  I’ll use a glossy serum.  But because I do constantly moisturize my hair, I have yet to find a staple oil for routine ( I’m still figuring things out myself. )"
Annabannana8409,8vpbku,Help itchy scalp&&&I have a constant itchy scalp. I’ve tried washing my hair and it doesn’t help. Any ideas on how to make it go away?
AvrieAvery,8vpbku,"Same here and it can be frustrating. At times skin conditions are a manifestation of an internal issue like an auto immune deficiency, allergic reaction, bad diet, lack of sleep, even stress. Sometimes the cause is fungal or bacterial, which doesn't necessarily go away just because one washes their hair. 

Basically without knowing the real cause of the itchy scalp, a topical treatment may only mask the problem and make the symptoms go away.... without addressing the real issue. 

Annnnnd with that said I rub a mixture of apple cider vinegar and a little water on my scalp. Also tea tree oil and coconut oil. I saw these on earth clinic and they work for me. 

However I've yet to address the real issue. And I don't sleep as much as I should and need to eat garlic ginger and turmeric in my meals and drink more water.... soooo it's a temp fix that lasts a few days. 

Everyone is different but whatever u do, try a patch test on your arm to make sure u not allergic. One fix does not fit all. "
Riversongbluebox,8vpbku,"Tea tree oil in conditioner. A few drops helps. Its antifungal and it stimulates growth. I use this more than mint, and ot really helps. Pure aloe vera can soothe as well. An olive oil pre-poo may help dry scalp. "
Weaselpanties,8vpbku,"My scalp gets itchy when it’s dry, so I do a light oil  treatment at the roots after every wash. Don’t know if that will solve your problem but I thought I’d throw it out there!"
badkarmabum,8vpbku,Have you tried spraying your scalp with a water and peppermint oil mixture?
TheYellowRose,8vk8r0,"Got my first DevaCut and treatment, here's what I learned.&&&Hey everyone. This past weekend I got my first DevaCut and my hair has never felt better.

In short, I've been doing everything wrong for years.

First thing I was doing wrong- not actually washing my hair. Co-washing is not the way to go for very curly hair. A clarifying shampoo free from sulfates and alcohols cleans your hair and allows moisture into the cuticle. If you only condition, a layer of stuff never really gets washed off your hair and essentially clogs it up. 

So she started off by cutting my hair dry to get rid of fairy knots, split ends, and to shape my hair up. Then she washed it with DevaCurl Buildup Buster with pretty cool water (very hot water opens your hair cuticles up too much). She recommended that I only wash once a week and co-wash as needed throughout the week. She rinsed that, then used some of the DevaCurl No-Poo Original and the Deep Sea Repair. Then she rinsed that and used a Texture ID Deep Treatment Mask and I sat under the steamer for a bit.

She rinsed that with cold water to seal it in, then used Design Essential Almond & Avocado Detangling Leave-In Conditioner and Texture ID Thermal Multi-Styling Foam. I sat under the dryer for a while after she put the product in my hair section by section with her hands. She also squished my curls and used a diffuser while I was under the dryer (she says air drying or a microfiber towel is fine too). She trimmed one errant curl and then lifted my hair with a pick.

If you're in the DFW area, I highly recommend her. PM me and I'll give you her contact info.

Other tips: she recommended I use silicone hair bands only, no fabric. I need to tie my hair up pineapple style when I sleep and either wear a scarf or sleep on a satin/silk pillowcase. Also drink tons of water. I plan on wearing more scarves in the winter time. If my curls feel flat after sleeping, get the bathroom really steamy and let them bounce back, add a leave in conditioner afterwards.

My hair is 3C for reference. Some of this advice may not work the same for type 4s, but her hair was a 4B and her routine sounded very similar. If you've never had a DevaCut, I highly recommend it.&&&I'll have to go look at the conditioner I was using and see if it has sulfates in it, thank you :) What's your hair type keytar?"
iownakeytar,8vk8r0,">First thing I was doing wrong- not actually washing my hair. Co-washing is not the way to go for very curly hair. A clarifying shampoo free from sulfates and alcohols cleans your hair and allows moisture into the cuticle. If you only condition, a layer of stuff never really gets washed off your hair and essentially clogs it up.

I have to disagree with your stylist here - not on ""nopoo"" methods, but on cowashing. I've cowashed on a daily basis for about 6 years. The thing that leads to build up from conditioner is generally silicone-based ingredients - silicones need harsh cleansers to wash them out. There are loads of silicone-free conditioners out there. I only wash my hair (with shampoo) every 2 weeks or so, when it's noticeably dirty. Please note I wear helmets 4-5 days a week (bike and scooter, skiing in the winter) and do a lot of swimming, hiking, camping and off-roading, so what's in my hair is generally not from the conditioner. When I'm not doing these activities, I can stretch between washes a little longer. I also use the dusting method to trim my own ends every 3 washes (6 to 8 weeks.) Still, having a clarifying, sulfate-free shampoo on hand for that is absolutely key.

I have not gotten a DevaCut^TM , but my stylist uses the same basic method for the cut. I've read a lot of horror stories about DevaCurl products leading to hair loss on r/curlyhair...and they're also a little out of my budget (as well as the cost of the cut.) I'm happy it worked for your hair, but I take what my stylist says as opinion, not fact. The CG method is focused on both sulfate-free shampoo and silicone-free conditioner, and that's worked well for me this far. My hair is definitely much healthier than it was after years of relaxers!
"
llnoonll,8vk8r0,"Thanks for this, very helpful! "
squeel,8vk8r0,"Found your post! Do you have any before/after pictures? I once got my hair cut in ""layers"" which really seemed to help, but I'm wondering if the Deva Cut is similar. Or is it less about the haircut and more about the process and products they use on you while there?"
BoxedBoobs,8vii6x,"What does your regimen entail? When was the last time you trimmed it? What sort of styling do you do? There could be many, MANY reasons why your hair doesn’t seem to grow. My hair is very coily and simply gets more dense when not stretched, so it always looks like a small fro unless I stretch it with twists or something. I was in a plateau, too, until my natural hair stylist got on me about regular trims. It wasn’t the end all be all miracle, but I do notice it’s less prone to split ends and damage because of less single strand knots. 

"
KayyxKayy,8vii6x,"(17 f) A long rant and questions about natural hair...&&&I have been natural for about 4 years if not longer and I have I would say acquainted to my hair. I would not go as far as to say I love my hair. I’m still struggling with it to this day. But once upon a time my hair used to be long, down my back and straight. Maybe that’s why it won’t grow...

4 years later after going through many big chops and thousands of YouTube videos later I cannot figure out the life of me how to get my hair to grow past my shoulders. I’m stuck in the horrid natural hair growth plateau. I’ve identified some problems like my inability to use coconut based products (allergic) or my stress induced hair loss. But even after chugging gallons of water, switching my regiment I can’t seem to figure out how to grow. 

I’m scared that it will never grow again. So what can I do? Any tips?&&&You all are so awesome!!!! Thanks I took your advice and gave my hair a nice trim! And I threw out some products that definitely were not right for me. Now I’m trying to find some that will work great, so far it’s this new conditioner and avocado oil. And hopefully new low manipulation styles too... I usually take a style out after 3 days because it just starts to look greasy and old. But here’s to new things :)"
Moya1509,8vii6x,"This. Natural hair growth is a formula. A bunch of little things can add up to make your hair not grow. For example:

Rough combing + drinking lots of water = still equals damaged hair

Leaving styles in too long + not getting trims regularly + hair vitamins = still equals damaged hair

Vitamins + healthy diet + low manipulation styles + certain deep conditioner - coconut oil +moisturizing regularly - rough combing = Healthy hair for someone

Everyone's hair uses a different formula, so we can't give you advice on what exactly to do, but we can help tell you what behaviors NOT to do to add up to a healthier regimen. The good news is that you used to have super long hair, so we know your hair CAN grow, it is  just a matter of figuring out what bad habits to break."
iownakeytar,8vii6x,"I'm the same way. I hit a growth plateau until I started trimming my ends regularly. It still looks pretty short, just because it's so tightly coiled that the growth isn't obvious unless I stretch it, but it's down to my shoulder blades. 

Most importantly, my hair is healthy. I think a lot of folks equate healthy hair with growth (and by extension, long hair) but that just doesn't hold true when your hair naturally shrinks."
