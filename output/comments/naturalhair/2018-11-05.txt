latisha05,9w0f4g,Love this! Where was this when I was a child? 
Dahliacid,9vzqjd,[Deep] condition your hair to help melt the tangles or u can use aloe Vera mixed with water n spritz it on ur hair. 
Leshbian,9vzqjd,"Aussie super moist conditioner melrs tangles right out of my head and it's pretty cheap. It's my holy grail detangling solution, but that's it. It's not good did much else, it's not moisturizing enough to use as a conditioner in general. I usually shampoo, detangle with Aussie moist, rinse and put in real conditioner. "
TuffTitti,9vzqjd,"Nappyheaded Jojoba has the bomb detangling solution: 

4 ounces coconut oil

https-hotep,9vzqjd,"Detangling Solutions...&&&I've been sick in bed for the past several days and my 4a pineapple'd hair has turned into a crispy lil birds' nest that I'm afraid to touch. Shortly after posting this, I will probably go into a Google search hole about proper detangling but I wanted to engage with community first. What do y'all recommend for detangling solutions? Detangling pre-poo? How do y'all like to prep your hair for a wash 'n' go? "
Ace_Turnip,9vyogo,"Solution for an itchy scalp!!&&&Hi everyone, I just wanted to share how I got rid of a scalp issue:

&#x200B;

Ever since I've been natural, I've always had an itchy scalp, especially in the crown. I didn't have any other scalp issues, just an itchy scalp. Sometimes, the itching would be so bad that my hair would fall out. I originally thought it was because my scalp was dry, so I started applying all kinds of oils (including castor oil), which increased the itching tenfold. 

I went to a natural hair salon and the stylist told me that my scalp was ""congested"" due to extra skin. Then I realized that for the last five years, I've only been using ""moisturizing"" and ""gentle"" shampoos that didn't clean my scalp or my low porosity hair. 

So I went to the drugstore, got the head n shoulders tea tree oil dandruff shampoo, tried it and was amazed at how clean my scalp felt. It's been five days since I washed my hair, have oiled my scalp twice during that time, and I haven't itched a single time! I can't believe that all this time, all that was needed was a simple dandruff/tea tree shampoo! 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Head'n'shoulders tea tree shampoo works wonders, and moisturizing shampoos are a lie!&&&yeah the itching is really a nightmare. I'm glad you also love tea tree oil :)&&&I'm happy you found something that works for you!! It's such a relief to not have an itchy scalp. And yeah for some of us, cowashing and mild shampooing does more damage than good.&&&Why wouldn't people use it on their scalps? Is it not a hair product?"
h007x,9vyogo,"I use Apple cider vinegar diluted in water (1:2 ratio) and also add in some essential oils like lavender and rosemary. I spray this mixture on my scalp + hair on wash day, massage it through really well and comb it through as well. ITS MAGICAL. Great detangler for the hair but also AMAZING cleanser for the scalp. No more flakes or itchiness. I feel like my hair got thicker and grows faster since I’ve started this almost 1 yr ago. "
ladyAnder,9vyogo,"Tea tree oil is my friend for an itchy scalp. 

Yeah for low porosity hair, you need to clarify your scalp as often as needed for you. I just use a clarifying shampoo. I can get away with not doing it much but when I wait too long, so much itching.  "
midnightslip,9vyogo,"I have the same issue and I use selsun blue once a week. Its not cg but whatever, other shampoos don't take that itch away. Happy you figured it out!!!"
mousemarie94,9vyogo,I use sulfur 8 ...which some would never put on their natural curly scalps but it helps with my intense dandruff like no other natural remedy or hair product. 
thickumsthrow,9vyogo,Yeah a good strong shampoo sometimes does the job. My hair was looking dull and flat lately. Did a good wash n go with my Tresemme deep clean shampoo and my curls are tighter and my hair is shinier. 
Jazzers88,9vxaee,"I don’t mean to like be bad influence but If I were you. I would be daring and shave my hair off into a TWA. That way you could start over and what could she do then? Plus it’ll be way easier for you to maintain your hair since it will be short & it will grow better that way. 

Juss a suggestion. Not sayin you should do it. But I juss know the typa teen I was and I would challenge my parents a lot cuz they juss simply didn’t make sense. "
MahBubblesSW,9vxaee,"Mom Won't Let me do my Natural Hair? UPDATE&&&So my mom found out about the post and has decided that I'll never do my hair again. I can't even touch it. She doesn't want to hear any of my suggestions and she's all of a sudden saying I'm trying to act ""grown"" and I'm ""doing whatever the hell I want to do"". All I want is to take care of my hair. Is that too much to ask? 

Anyways thanks a bunch to those who responded to my post, I appreciate it, but it's no use trying anymore. :(
"
jjumpin,9vxaee,i feel you on that. it sucks not having free will over your own body.
omojos,9vxaee,"I read your other post and your mom is controlling you with your hair. It’s obviously a larger problem than just your hair. Yikes. You may have to ride this out, but legally you will be an adult in a few years so at least there’s that.

You should find a good friend who can order the hair products you need if your mom is restricting your access. Moisturize your ends and keep it detangled at all times so that when she forces you to let her wash and style, it will be less painful. Wear braids more often, since once your hair is braided she can’t bother you for a while until they come out. Then take your own braids out and detangle before she can do anything else to you."
geminijas,9vwjtv,"My hair is always dry and it feels like I'm damaging it. Help?&&&I'm new to hair care, and just recently figured out a routine that I like. In fact, for the first time, I wore my hair out in a wash-and-go in public. But I'm still learning, and I'm worried that my inexperience is going to damage my hair in the long-run.

I don't put anything on my hair at night. I used to, but every morning I would wake up and the scarf/bonnet would be somewhere on the floor. So, I went and bought a satin pillow case. Now, every night I put my hair in two or three little buns and go to sleep (I also use satin scrunchies). 

But, when I wake up, my hair is dry as hell. I spray some water on it and put in leave-in-conditioner and then try to finger detangle, but every time I could practically hear my hair ripping. It feels like ripping apart velcro, even though I'm trying to separate the strands as gently as I can. Sometimes it feels like sections of my hair have matted; like I have random unintentional dreads in my hair? 

There's minimal actual breakage, though; like, when I pull my fingers out of my hair, I don't have clumps of ripped out strands in my hand. I mean, there's some every morning, but not an alarming amount. Still, it feels like I'm damaging strands by forcing them apart.

I do most of my hair care in the morning, and only mess with it at night on wash days, since I shower at night. Should I be doing everything at night? Or? Because I'm also afraid that by messing with it *everyday* due to how dry/matted it is, I'm damaging my hair by manipulating it too much.

Also, during the day, after I go to battle with the tangles, I just wear it down or in a pony-tail. I don't wear any other type of style (mostly because I don't know *how* do to anything else), so I'm not doing any of the typical protective styles (braids, twists, etc). Not sure if that matters or not, though. &&&Yeah, I think I'm going to go and try to find a cap/bonnet that won't fall off (I'm a wild sleeper, though; nothing ever stayed on at night before). But in the meantime, I'll switch over to doing all my hair stuff at night. I'm also starting to think the 2-3 buns I sleep in aren't doing my hair any favors, so for tonight I'll probably do some twists too. Thank you for your advice! From all the reviews, I figured the pillowcase would be this amazingly convenient solution to keeping my hair protected at night, but I guess it just depends on the hair.&&&Oh, I'm not sure if my hair is protein sensitive. I actually never considered that, but I'm researching it now. Apparently, too much can make the hair brittle and dry? I'll have to look into maybe switching up the products I use. Thanks for mentioning this."
moonchild2998,9vwjtv,"Hmmm...do you think your hair is protein sensitive? That’s a problem for some people, so I’d consider looking into that.

For me, I added Cantu twist and lock gel to my routine (while my hair was still wet) and after I put it into twist or ponytails (I also can’t do my hair) it was super soft and moisturized the next day. "
yourbestbudz,9vwjtv,"Some people have really dry hair by genetics. If this is you, you will have to moisturize and cover your hair at night to retain the moisture. The pillowcase never worked for me because like you, I would wake up and my hair was really dry. Now I have found a hair cap that is fitted so it will stay on at night. My night routine is spray water with leave in conditioner plus a little oil on my scalp. Put on the night cap and a bonnet on top. Hair is still moisturized in the morning and all I have to do is unravel my twists and go. "
BadMouthBarbie,9vun8n,"And I know you said you don’t like buns, but consider adding a little flair to your buns to keep it interesting - a twist or a French braid across the front, bun in the back or a part of the side and  a classy, low bun. 

If you don’t have one already, those little bun makers make your buns look incredible "
etcaves,9vun8n,You can braid your own hair into singles and wear it in a bun. That's what I do. Still wash and deep condition. Then rebraid the singles.
iownakeytar,9vun8n,"I put my hair in a couple of French braids during the week, take it down on the weekends when we go out - unless we're skiing that weekend, in which case I just freshen up the braids."
iwanttobeanonplz,9vun8n,"Winter routine?&&&I want to keep my hair on my head this winter, but I've never been in an area with winters this harsh before. How do you change your routine for extreme winters? (snow) And how do you style your hair, how often do you wash, moisturize etc.

&#x200B;

BTW, I don't want to protective style with fake hair, idk why but I just can't stand fake hair rn, I want to wait until at least December to put in braids, I've been doing buns but I want to find a better way to do them.&&&This idea is mad cute, my hair isn't quite thick enough in singles and the hair in the front isn't long enough for that, nor is the hair anywhere else lmao. I still love the thought, when my hair passes bra strap length I'll try that"
Honeychile6841,9vau7a,"Tool Structure 3 Row Styling Comb https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004AGM25Q/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_9tk5BbZ11KBN3
"
Jazzers88,9vau7a,"I Fixed My Own Problem 😁&&&So I couple days ago I was complaining about how I have massive shedding when I wash my hair. I always moisturize, I take my time, I use my Denam brush and wide tooth comb. Ya know, being a responsible natural, following the rules 🤪. What I didn’t realize??That my problem were the tools I was using to detangle my hair. *Mind Blown* 🤯🤯

I remember seeing how well someone curls clumped when they used a get ready,.... 3 ROW STYLING COMB, for a wash and go. So I looked at mines, that I had bought months ago and hadn’t used yet, and realized the way the rows are setup I betcha I could detangle my hair this way!

So boom hopped in the shower juss now and I’m currently deep conditioning as I type. I’ve had the least amount of shedding I’ve ever had in years. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Bravo 4C hair you’ve been spared. 

SB: Sorry I’m a little animated but I get really excited when I finally fix something that was wrong with my hair 💁🏽‍♀️
&&&Yes once I finger detangled, THEN used the 3 row styling comb it took about 2mins or less to get they completely. Section by section. I usually do four sections then split all those in half for 8 total. I feel like that’s an optimal sized section for this type comb. &&&If you got to your local beauty supply store you can prolly find it for $1-$3 so I don’t recommend using Amazon unless you’re lazy ☺️&&&Yeah I would always finger detangle. But I found the that the 3 styling comb was doing wonders for me versus my Denam or wide tooth. Plus I’ve jus started using Aussie conditioner and it was giving me major slip. That helped a lot as well"
_CoachMcGuirk,9vau7a,A 3 ROW STYLING COMB?
eohtra,9vau7a,Wait so what exactly did you use to fix it? 
jamlesstoast,9vau7a,I’ve been considering buying this for quite some time now. I also saw a YouTuber with type 4 hair use it to define her hair. I’m tempted to buy it even more now lol 
lavasca,9vau7a,I must google this. I just use my fingers but I’’d like more definition near my roots.
midnightslip,9vau7a,I had no idea what op was talking about until I saw your link. Then the lightbulb went off lol thanks!
tabby_whiskers,9vau7a,"I hope you finger detangle before putting any kind of comb in your hair? It's much more gentle, and I've heard a lot of naturals stop using combs altogether once their hair reaches a certain length."
blackgoldberry,9vaqmg,"Type of Pantene shampoo to use for transitioning hair&&&Hi, the last time I had a perm was August of last year (though I have used heat) and while I have been using Pantene pro-v daily moisture renewal. I was wondering since I’m transitioning (and need to buy more shampoo) what would work best with my hair. It’s fine, and while it’s been a very long time since my hair has been all natural, I believe it’s in the 4a/4b range since it draws up and my mother said I have looser curls than my sister (who is 4b/4c). Thanks!"
curlgarden,9uy1lm,Wow! Didn’t know that learned something new. 
wesmellthecolor9,9uy1lm,"Denman brush PSA&&&For anyone using or interested in using the denman brush, please know that you can remove rows of bristles from the brush. I have every other line of bristles pulled out (so I have rows 1-3-5-7), and it makes a HUGE difference on my thick 3c hair. The numerous people I've told about this had no idea so I thought I would share. 

The denman brush has that pink section that actually is an insert. You just pull it out (a little hard the first time), unfold it, and remove/replace the rows, then put it back in. I save my unused bristles as extras if they bend or break in the future. There some YouTube videos too if my instructions were confusing, that's how I learned how to do it. 

I personally prefer the denman to brushes like the tangle teezer type brushes since my hair is so thick it takes forever and breaks my hair. If anyone gave up and threw their denman in the cabinet pull it out, modify it, and try again!! "
TuffTitti,9uwbhf,"You might want to try gorilla snot, creme of nature styling snot or wetline extreme gel. 

what are you trying to do to 3b on the left? make it curlier?  Because only roller, flexirods or curlformers etc... will make them uniform with the rest of your hair."
alienvomit,9uwbhf,"Can anybody suggest other edge products?&&&Let's just say, I have 4 different curl types. Through frustration, experimenting and eventually transitioning. That's what it settled on.

I've tried Eco Styler, it's very sometime-y and it flakes.

I use got2b glue and it works most of the time. The problem is; when there's ""too much hair"", no matter what I do.. It rebels.

I know what works for the 3C/4A in the back, I know what works for the 3A on the right.

I need help with the 3B on the left. What should I try? 

P.S. My hair has never listened to me a day in my life. &&&Thank you. Never heard of that. I will definitely look where to buy. 

No, I'm not trying to make it curlier. (The hair, not the edges) Just keep it healthy. I haven't dyed my hair in 3+ years, but I'm planning on dying my hair again. "
sqwzmahmeatybts,9uwbhf,"It's expensive, but Hick's Edges always did me right, and I NEVER had any flakes like I do with Got 2b. "

sj_81,9uvax9,"I have a 3b/3c TWA which I slick down overnight and wear stretched the next couple of days and then curly. I wash and deep condition with with Shea Moisture’s Manuka Honey intense moisture line. When wet I put in Curl Enhancing Smoothie, JBCO and Eco Styler. Brush down, wrap overnight. Next day, move it about to get rid of the gel cast. Works pretty well. "
Beautyinloss,9uuesj,"Agreed! I liked the book — I’m battling and improving on no brushes. I stopped combing my hair a while back but I still brush to style my edges. I hate getting products on my hands.

Also the tip about shoulder length hair needing to be put up to get past that length most of stay stuck at. She was speaking directly to me! 😂"
JerseyGirlontheGo,9uuesj,"I've been doing this not knowing it was the ""curly girl method"". Except I switch to a hair mask 1-2/x a week with 1/2 an avocado, coconut oil, and a squeeze of conditioner. My 4c curls are so stretched and defined and my hair is super shiny. "
anonymousobvi,9uuesj,What conditioner do you use? I can’t find one that I am comfortable with leaving in my hair.
dontputthatjujuonme,9uuesj,Thanks for the tips. I might have to look into getting the book myself.
lulumajorca,9uuesj,"I tried the variation of the Curly Girl method geared towards kinky/coily hair and my life will never be the same&&&The other day I was browsing the shelves of my local bookstore and came across the Curly Girl Handbook by Lorraine Massey, founder of DevaCurl. Prior to this, my knowledge of the Curly Girl method had come from various youtube videos and blog posts by curly girls and I assumed that it was just the cessation of using silicones and sulfates. I had tried a variation of the method in the past and I had liked the results, but they still weren't as great as I thought they should be so I stopped.

When I flipped through the book, I realized that Lorraine actually goes through the main subtypes of curls, including cherub, corkicelli, botticelli and zigzag/fractal curls aka kinky/coily curls. These various curl patterns require different types of maintenance routines according to Lorraine and she dedicates a different chapter to each type of curl. For kinky/coily curls, there was an additional first step of applying conditioner onto dry hair before getting in the shower,  this is supposed to act make the conditioning process more effective, and saves water. The rest of the routine pretty much mimics a regular co-wash routine, but she also includes some helpful tips such as combing the hair with fingertips from underneath, implementing a squish to condish so the hair is fully saturated with product, and probably the most effective tip which was to not rinse out the conditioner. Finger detangling my hair was always my biggest issue but by following the above steps I was able to finger comb through my hair with ease. 

I technically do a modified curly girl method now since a lot of my conditioners have silicones, but my hair is really thriving. I don't necessarily agree with every suggestion made in the book, and ladies with 4c hair might have to proceed with caution but I would recommend anyone try it.&&&I used  the Pantene sleek conditioner just because it's what I had on hand. The book recommends ""botanical"" conditioners but I think any silicone free one should work. If you use one with silicones you have to clarify every once and a while. &&&Np! I found a free PDF version of the book online as well. I just googled ""curly girl method for zigzag curls"" and it was the first search result &&&I literally bought a new denman brush the other day which will now be futile lol. 

I also loved Vida's tips regarding the use of conditioner nightly. These YouTube gurus with 3c/4a can get away with using a dollop of conditioner and I would try to mimic them and get upset that my hair was always dry smh. My hair sucks up conditioner like a sponge so I need at least a few handfuls 😂"
thickumsthrow,9uuesj,You are so right! I just purchased the book as well. Gives GREAT maintenance and care tips! Very detailed and informative
yourbestbudz,9uuesj,Thanks! I will read it. 
HumbleAbbreviations,9upia4,"You can but if you refrigerate it, you better use it up within a week or two."
SABRlNASPEIIMAN,9upia4,You can also freeze it
cocolanoire,9upia4,"Seconding that.

Jazzers88,9ukzzp,Aloe Vera Treatments&&&If you use fresh Aloe Vera in your regimen how do you include it and how do you store the rest to last for several weeks? Pre poo? Spray bottle? What’s your tricks? 
ladyAnder,9ukzzp,"A lot of the time, I just cut the leaf of and cut off a piece as needed. Sometimes I'll just rube that piece directly on my hair or I mix it with water in a spray bottle. maybe a little oil as well.   

The leaves alone can stay out for about three weeks maybe even a little more before it shrivels and dries out. 

I use to make my own pre-poos/detanling spray with aloe, honey, and an oil of my choice and used it that way. 

For daily use,  I scarp the goo out, blended it, strained it, and put it in the refrigerator for several days. The goo will turn brown in a day or two, but it's still good.

You can store it in the freezer after you've blended it and strained it into ice cube trays and place in the freezer. Once it's froze, place in a freezer bag. That's probably one of the better ways. You melt a cube when needed and you have a mass supply of aloe that doesn't go bad so quick. "
