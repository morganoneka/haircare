Awakeat5amagain,a4rww9,"Video of your product? 

So the wand warms leave in conditioner?"
BadMouthBarbie,a4rww9,"I would suggest focusing on the on the scalp rather than excluding the scalp. After workouts, the idea is to get your scalp clear of sweat and debris. Even co-washing the length every other day can be harsh if you already have dry hair. &&&I also work out fairly frequently. I usually put my hair in a pineapple or a loose, high pony. Neither of those styles disturb my curl too much and they allow sweat to dry fairly quickly. I just shake it out after class, and my hair is pretty much dry and back to my preferred style in a few minutes. 

I only put my hair in a bun when I‚Äôm close to wash day because buns really mess up my curls and require restyling after. 

I co-wash once during the week and wash with shampoo towards the end of the week. There aren‚Äôt really any shortcuts unfortunately ... it requires a lot of time and effort. 

I‚Äôm actually in the process of designing tools to help women with textured hair manage exercising and daily styling. Check us out and let me know what you think. I‚Äôm trying to get as much feedback as possible so that these tools are as effective at cutting down style times. Happy to share additional product concepts and info. Just DM me.

Sharbubbles972,a4rww9,"Working out while Natural&&&I did a search on hair tips for when you work out a lot (example: pineapple, witch hazel/rose water on scalp)

My questions for you guys are:

1) For someone who works out 4-5 times a week, how would you alter your wash/cowash routine? My hair is extremely dry and I am trying to establish a routine. I know I overwash my hair.

2) What styles would you stick to? I typically go with a wash and go or I will wear my hair in a bun. 

(I have been natural for a long time but just now trying to make the effort to really care for my hair and treat it right.)

"
empressM,a4rww9,"I workout about 3-4 times a week:
I also have type 4, low porosity hair 

I usually keep my hair in 2 braids w/middle part- its super quick to do before you go- I usually wash once a week (when I'm not being lazy) with TGIN shampoo- the ONLY shampoo that works for me with clearing my scalp without STRIPPING it and giving me that dry feeling. And then do my normal routine. 
Don't do the raids too tight bc I've noticed my edges are struggling lately üò´"
foxxa121,a4rww9,"I‚Äôm a twist out gal. When working out I will put hair is a few large twists. Wrap it up and leave it til it dries. I do a full wash w/deep condition 1x a week. In summer when I‚Äôm working out I will cowash on maybe day 3, do about 10-12 flat twists, dry overnight, makes nice full style. That keeps me from looking crazy at work :) I have ver thick, shoulder length type 4 hair with hella shrinkage!!"
justswimfree,a4rww9,I wash my hair probably every 1-2 weeks. I‚Äôm real lazy. Honestly I cornrow my hair or flat twist it for most of the week and then maybe on the weekend I‚Äôll take it out because I don‚Äôt work out on those days. 
lavasca,a4rww9,"Just co-wash evety other day excluding scalp.

Wash scalp  weekly unless swimming in which case each time you swim, pre-treating scamp with coconut oil.

Wash and Go for the win.

I get rashes if I don‚Äôt wash frequently

nashia25,a4rww9,"Since my hair lives in twists, it dries pretty quickly. But because I am lazy, I sometimes use ORS ‚Äúdry‚Äù shampoo and warm cloth to wash my scalp and still co-wash my hair once a week. I also clarify every Saturday. I exercise 5-6 days a week so i keep the above schedule. "

Saturnaliia,a4ligx,"Looking for someone who can cut 3C hair in VA/DC/MD/WV (yes, I'm that desperate)&&&Guys, I need some help. I moved to Northern VA in June 2017 from Toronto and have not yet found someone who knows how to cut 3 or 4 curly hair, which is amazing to me given this area's demographics! I'm guessing it's just because I don't know of anyone else with 3 or 4 natural hair and I've only been using Google to find places. 

Back home, I had a salon dedicated to curly hair. They had 2 locations, each with at least 6 hairstylists who had curly hair ranging from 2 to 4. They had basically every curly product under the sun and used whatever my hair needed, not whatever brand they were being paid to push. They did a dry cut then a wet cut, then dried it, and cut again if necessary. 

I've been to two places so far - somewhere in Lorton (can't remember the name, the stylist was Karen though) and while the cut was okay, it was expensive imo and she only used Devacurl products. While I definitely use some Deva products, I find my hair doesn't like a lot of their styling creams. 
The second place I just went to was Lofty Salon in Vienna... Mona evidently had no idea how to cut 3C hair. It turned out okay again and was cheaper than the first place, but it's not somewhere I'd go again - she admitted she didn't carry or use any products strong enough to hold my hair. 

I don't mind paying for a good cut, I just have to find somewhere that will do one!! I will drive pretty much anywhere in the DMV or down to Richmond for someone who knows what they're doing and uses a good variety of brands... It doesn't have to be fancy either. Does anyone have any recommendations of salons or ways that I could find one down here? Thank you in advance!

TL;DR - tired of salons/stylists that don't know how to cut 3 or 4 type hair, will travel and pay well for someone who knows what they're doing! &&&I know, I said I was desperate üò≠&&&Thank you! Do you know if Devacurl salons/Devacut specific places only use Devacurl, or a mix of brands? I like their conditioners/shampoos but their styling products dry out my hair. 
&&&Thank you! My only concern is the one Devacut I got, the stylist only used Devacurl products (which I understand). Do you know if that's typical of a Devacut or do some use other brands? &&&I love it!! Thank you. She's only an hour and ten minutes from me so not too far at all! I'll shoot you a message :)&&&Thank you!! I will check it out :)&&&Thank you! I really don't mind paying - I'd drop hundreds every 4 months at the last place just to keep my hair maintained. 
I like going to places with other products so I can see how my hair likes them and then buy them if they work out better than what I'm currently using! I find I have to rewash if the stylist uses any of Devacurl's shapers or styling creams... I've tried nearly all of them at this point and they all dry out my hair or don't keep the frizz down. :(&&&I don't understand it! We have so many people with curly hair. &&&Thank you! She's familiar with 3/4 type hair? &&&Thank you!! &&&Thank you! "
Tarfa212,a4ligx,Lauren Best at Thinking Over Hair works at the Salons by JC in Sterling. She cut hair at Fiddleheads yeaaaars ago and she's so good I've followed her to 3 salons. She'll tell you what works for your hair and doesn't use only Deva curl products.

clare_bear88,a4ligx,Lilly at Salon Revive in DC (accessible via yellow and green lines if you metro) saved my hair. I damaged my hair horribly in college & then got it all cut off two years ago. She's very focused on hair care and she's a miracle worker with curls. Salon Revive is pricey but worth it
kimbolslice,a4ligx,"there are a handful of Devacurl salons in the DMV. check their website for specifics.

panicswitching,a4ligx,"Rachel at Bang Salon on U Street. I have a different texture but she is fantastic at cutting curly hair, she‚Äôs the only person I go to."
pygmy_puf_86,a4ligx,"Hooray I live right by there! 

Does she cut hair in its curly state or does she straighten it first? What texture is your hair? "
regularting,a4ligx,"I really like fiddleheads, but is pricey if you go to the more experienced stylists. I only go twice a year though, so I think it‚Äôs worth it....

They also use deva products though. I don‚Äôt like using deva myself, but don‚Äôt mind it when I get my hair cut - especially since Vicky at the salon is the only person I trust to cut my hair in the DMV. "
rossablue,a4ligx,There are a number of salons in the area that specialize in curly hair. I go to Oasis Salon in Rockville. Go to the devacurl website and look for a salon that specializes in the devacut in your area.
skidkneee,a4ligx,I've been going to Beauty Naturals Supply & Salon in Kentlands/Gaithersburg for years. 
yourbestbudz,a4ligx,I live in DC and have the same problem. 
SugarPie89,a4dsl5,"I also never got my hair trimmed but I also would like to get it cut and shaped. The hair on the top of my hair grows really fast and reaches the back of my head already and I would like to have it more ""layered"" I guess. Do you think I could actually do this by myself? "
bennodabear,a4dsl5,Do it at home. Look up tutorials and read articles (WRITTEN FOR BLACK PEOPLE). Since I've been natural I've been pretty self sufficient. You should too. 
carmieeee,a4dsl5,I literally just twisted my hair last week and clipped the ends. My hair is fine. Just do as they‚Äôve stated above. 
foxxa121,a4dsl5,"Cut it your self, use hair shears. The inexpensive ones from beauty supply work fine. Do it on stretched, blown out hair. You just need to do enough to clean up any damage in your ends. Don‚Äôt worry too much about shape, especially if you protective style or wear your hair curly.  "
n_kaye,a4dsl5,I separate my hair into 12-16 parts and twist them. Then with hair shears I trim whatever isn‚Äôt super juicy like the rest of the twist. I‚Äôve definitely noticed easier detangling and less breakage from doing this every 6-8 weeks 
sqoorelfreend,a4dsl5,"I haven't been able to get a trim in years and wont be able to afford one until next spring&&&The last time and only I got my hair trimmed professionally was in 2015 so it obviously needs. My mom a wanted me to get my hair trimmed because she thinks you only need it when you use heat (I never use heat). She also thinks that because my ends still curl they can't be damaged (it's really frustrating, I've been asking to get a trim for years). I'm 18 now but I can't but a job until next spring because I'm really busy with school this semester. I've tried trimming it on my own but i do it badly obviously because I'm not a professional.

I'm scared my hair is so far gone that I have to cut have of it off because the split ends might have traveled really far up. Which is discouraging because my hair is super short already"
AdamantiumFoil,a3z1t2,Definitely shampoo after you take the braids out. Lots of goop sticks to the base of the braids that you can't really see when they're installed. It doesn't get washed away easily even if you shampoo well while it's braided.
Robinspeakeasey,a3z1t2,"I have ridiculous buildup after that much time in a protective style...it's not necessary to be generous with the shampoo, but I would definitely use it on my actual hair and not just the scalp."
SugarPie89,a3z1t2,"Do I need to wash my actual hair?&&&I think most of us have already heard that shampoo is meant for your scalp but I was wondering if you should be also washing your hair too. I have box braids in right now, had them in for 2 months and I want to take them out soon. I washed my hair last week but really only focused on my scalp and didn't shampoo the braids. I want to wash my hair in braids again because it will be way easier. Then I would take the braids out afterwards and deep condition. But should I  shampoo my hair too since it's been two months? &&&Why do you suggest deep conditioning first?"
foxxa121,a3z1t2,"Wash it all, coily hair tends to trap dirt and I‚Äôm sure you will have some product build up. A good deep condition with heat after will restore moisture."
sqwzmahmeatybts,a3z1t2,"If I were in your position, I would deep condition first, then take the braids out and shampoo my hair and scalp. 


I wouldn't recommend deep conditioning the length of the braids, just up until the point of your natural hair. 

But yea, if you end up taking them down, then deep conditioning, shampooing you hair won't hurt, especially after 2 months."

PinkPurse12,a3oxcx,If you put oil in my hair before and after applying the gel will that prevent flakes?&&&I really love the creme of nature snot its the only gel that actually gives me hold so my braid out can last 5 days straight. But I did get some flakes. I used another gel called gorilla snot and when I used a lot of oil I didnt get flakes and was wondering if same thing would happen with creme of nature. Anybody try it for twist outs/braidouts?&&&Ok I will. I just bought an oil called african royale hot 6 the first ingredient olive oil.
Port64,a3oxcx,If you try please provide an update! Maybe you could try grape seed oil. It‚Äôs a light weight oil. Or argan oil. Lightweight and has great properties for hair. 
BooBootheFool22222,a3hm34,"I've been having problems with this too. my hair is high porosity and the ends are bleached and dyed. i've been using cantu's color protect/anti fade oil (in the little bottle) for my perm rod curls because it is light and heavy product seems to weigh my hair down. but of course, because it's oil; it leeches color. but then again, the color is going to be slipping off anyway because of the condition of the hair and just from styling it seems. 

i use redken's color extend shampoo and conditioner; pricey but it made such a difference in the way my hair felt (i was not expecting that). before that i used aphogee's shampoo for damaged hair; it's amazing too. the balancing moisturizer is great as well.

for daily styling i have this shea moisture anti- frizz conditioner i use as a leave in. and the sacha inchi oil condition."
ChocolateGlamazon27,a3hm34,Creme of Nature Argan Buttermilk is the Holy Grail for 4C hair. 
_totallysafeforwork,a3hm34,"For moisture, I've found that Shea Moisture JBCO leave in works miracles when I apply it on damp hair every other day and seal with shea butter or castor oil. I really like the conditioning mask from this line as well.

AdamantiumFoil,a3dgap,"I didn't start seeing them decrease until I started wearing my hair stretched 100% of the time. Either in twists, or twist-outs. No more wash and go's for me! Not worth it.

Maybe that's contributing to your issue?"
BooBootheFool22222,a3dgap,this is what i found out as well. even when i just take the twists down for a little quick style or for a bang it magically starts to tangle again.
Dead2MyFamily,a3dgap,Get a trim and keep your ends super moisturized and tucked away most of the time. 
Suomwe,a3dgap,"A few ideas: 

Use a wide toothed combed to detangle hair, or even fingers. 

Detangle hair when wet and saturated with conditioner so that the hair strands easily slide over each other. 

Sleep with a silk scarf or satin bonnet to stop the friction when sleeping to allow the hair to knot up."
babykcm,a3dgap,Something that helped was making sure my hair is moisturized üôÇ so figure out a routine that * works for your hair *  & that will keep you hair moisturized . 
blilola,a3dgap,"I had a similar problem with my hair. Sometimes it depends on what products you‚Äôre using. I normally use shea butter, but I ran out and got too lazy to replace it.

BooBootheFool22222,a3c670,"castor oil, olive oil or grape seed oil when i need it to move/be bouncy. coconut oil never worked for me. all my friends swear by it tho."

SugarPie89,a387wm,"What you could do is put your hair in 4 braids (plats i think? not cornrows) and then bobby pin them down.

cali5795,a32mpp,"I combed out 7yrs old mid back locs. Yes it is possible, very time consuming but possible.

-sunshine17,a30aah,"Not biracial, but I have a similar hair type. I used to want tighter hair too, but I think it‚Äôs better to learn to love your own texture. I will say that one thing that made it harder for me to like my texture was how damaged it was. Sometimes it‚Äôs harder to notice how much damage affects looser curls because it can seem like that‚Äôs just the texture, but that‚Äôs not right. After I cut my hair, I actually realized that I had curls in certain areas of my head. 

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend a perm because in my opinion, it will most likely do more harm than good. I would recommend getting a hair cut/trim and basically think of it as starting from scratch. Experiment with different products without doing perm rods also (because some can make the texture come out more). I usually use gel, but mousse can help too. "

BooBootheFool22222,a2x3hi,"i have high porosity hair and i just learned what anti-frizz products can do for my hair.

In my experience it's much better to use moisturing thick gels like linseed gel, okra gel, hair custards.  DIY versions work best for me. "
TuffTitti,a2x3hi,"I love it! if you use glycerin gel activator its fine, but pure glycerin must be diluted or it will strip ALL the moisture out of your hair. Add 1 tablespoon of glycerin to 4 ounces of distilled water, aloe vera juice, or conditioner for a moisturizing leave-in"
curlgarden,a2x3hi,"glycerin and honey have both worked for me especially when diluted or mixed with other products. However, I stop using during colder months because it draws moisture to your hair and I don‚Äôt want dry/cold air being drawn to my hair. "
lakija,a2x3hi,I‚Äôd love to know too. 
lashawn3001,a2x3hi,I‚Äôve just begun using glycerin on my 3c/4a High porosity curls. My hair LOOKS good but I‚Äôve heard glycerin can be drying/damaging to hair. Anyone else using glycerin on similar hair types? What‚Äôs been your experience with it.&&&&&&Thanks. I diluted with water and added liquid coconut oil. It feels moisturized but it‚Äôs only been a day since I added to my routine. &&&Okra gel!?! Do tell how you make that?
shida206,a2x3hi,It doesn't bother me... but I am still transitioning...
