ButterflyNTheSky,qzcl3b,"I'm sorry that happened to you. I would definitely look at treatments like Olaplex (#3) and protein treatments like Aphogee, always followed by a deep conditioning treatment."
gellybaby94,qzcl3b,"Happened to me back in 2017, I basically regrew my hair. You can try protein treatments, Indian aztec clay with acv, frequent trims. Just continue to deep condition and be consistent. I also think that there is something you need to do to revert your hair other than conditioner, like your suppose to rinse out whatever straightening  product so your hair can start reabsorb moisture"
hippeemom,qzcl3b,"Silk press disaster, opinions please!&&&So after 3 years of being natural, I decided to get a silk press. Done by a professional ofcourse. My hair was SUPER healthy, thick, and curly with very minimal shedding. The days following the press I noticed excessive shedding. For the weeks to follow the crazy shedding continued. I never added more heat. The style lasted 3 weeks until I wet it at this point the shedding finally slowed. The shedding resulted in what seems like half of my hair lost. It’s nowhere as thick and my curls are reduced to curly waves and was extremely dry. Aside from me achieving conditioned hair again, It’s been months and I highly doubt it will revert back. Hate my new ramen noodle texture. Any comments? Help? Idk something."

Tiffanetic,qzaud1,Braidout Vibes❣&&&&&&Hair Routine: Did a braidout (approx 10 braids) using Maui Moisture Curl Smoothie&&&Thank youu&&&Thank youu&&&Thank Youu&&&Thank you so much!&&&Thank You!&&&Thank you!
EloquentElixir,qz98ye,You probably need a different product for this part of your hair compared to the rest. You could try finger coiling it instead of raking to get it curly
Livibumblebee,qz98ye,Same issue! I dampen and twist them and then pin curl them with a bobby pin until they dry.
gaia_de_gaille,qz98ye,"Wash and go advice? Front hair won’t curl!&&&For some reason, the very front of my hair won’t curl when I do my wash and gos, it’s a looser curl pattern and I’m not sure what to do with it! When I add gel and rake, it just looks wavy and frizzy. Any ideas on what I can do to fix this? Or should I just give my hair time to adjust to doing this new style?&&&Thank you so much! I’ll give finger curling a try. As for a different product, should I use something other than gel?&&&That’s a good idea, thank you!"

_charliezena,qz8l68,Blew out my Hair for the first time in MONTHS its grown so much! 🤯&&&&&&Thank you so much!!!! I want to see how long it will grow!&&&Hahahaha Ayeeee hahaha so funny u found me in the reddit community! I love that! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾&&&Do i need to clip my ends?
hottie1234567891,qz8l68,Amazingly beautiful
sparrowtea,qz8l68,Your hair is stunning! I find that if my hair starts to become harder to detangle then it's usually time to have a trim.
_charliezena,qz4nve,I cut about an inch off my hair in July. its now November and its already grew the inch back and then some! 🥰&&&
BeautyOfaWolf,qz4f6j,"Jamaican black castor oil. Moisturize as needed. I can give u a recipe to make your own hair growth oil or u can try to find an organic company that sells it, but if u want a simple solution pure Jamaican black castor oil will do the trick. Raw Aloe vera works wonders as well. Cut the plant open & just rub that throughout your scalp/hair. Leave in for 20-30 mins or leave it in overnight then rinse next day! Sleep with a silk du rag on your hair at night to prevent further breakage & unhealthy friction. U can also try making your own hair masks which usually include a carrier oil like cold pressed olive oil/jojoba/avocado, Shea butter/mango butter, raw eggs, honey, essential oils & vitamin e! Come up with a hair routine that works for u & remain consistent for at least 2-3 months. I guarantee you'll see astronomical results! Good luck 🤞 I hope I gave u some great tips!"
M_Aku,qz4f6j,"Was this a quick hair loss or was it slow? Either way hair loss that is uneven and spotted like this looks similar to alopecia. It could also be something health related. The thing about hair loss is that it's really tricky and sometimes irreversible if there is no quick intervention. If it's health related, like low iron, then the only way to treat it would be medically."
Rboogz57,qz4f6j,"Can someone please tell me what to do like what kind of hair loss is this because I want to grow it back normally have long hair, I want to fix it&&&&&&It was slow it wasn’t overnight and yeah I’m gonna go to a doctor to try and see what’s happening&&&Yeah I’ve been using a mixture of rosemary oil black castor oil and lavender oil in my hair for like a month now just rubbing it into my scalp I think that is working a little bit.

Yeah I’ll definitely try the aloe Vera 

No problem I will also look into the hair masks
Yeah I’ll do everything you’re recommending 

Thanks for taking time to answer my question"
EloquentElixir,qz43z2,"Well to start, when was the last time you got a trim?"
Tsimms2009,qz43z2,Trim your edges once a month and also try this Rapid Growth Oil it has worked wonders on my hair www.blendmajestic.com
Wheelz95,qz43z2,"The sub is NaturalHair. Just stick with washing and brushing. Brush daily, wash about every other day or two days (wash, leave it alone a day or two, wash again) no spray, no curling, no straightener 😀"
_charliezena,qz43z2,"Definitely avoid heat, more protective styles but not too much tension on hair"
laurchelle,qz43z2,"Help With Hair&&&I've (15, F) been natural for about 3 and a half years now, relaxed all of my life. Ever since I became a natural, I was so focused on everyone else's regimens and experience I ended up messing up my hair in the process. My hair went from bra strap length to ear length this past year due to breakage, heat damage, as well as the use of the wrong products. Is there a way I can restart my journey without big chopping? Should I treat my hair as if it were still transitioning? What should I buy for my hair wash day and moisture wise? Please help, it would mean alot!&&&week and a half ago&&&can't buy offline, but i have been trimming so i don't know why my hair is like this..&&&i can't wash my hair back to back like that, neither can i brush at my hair daily. they'll both do more damage to my hair, trust me i've tried."
strawberrysweetpea,qz43z2,Following! 😫
Readyreadyreddit,qz2lp3,"Tips for a faux locs first timer&&&Hey there everyone!
So recently I have been overwhelmed in my personal life, & my hair is being somewhat neglected because of it, I just don’t have the time to take care of it & manage like I need to.
Because of this I thought it would be a good time to finally try braid or locs (decided on locs). I’ve always wanted some & think it’s a good time to put my hair in a protective style & change it up a bit. 

I will be messaging a local stylists tomorrow to ask some questions about the instal & overall maintenance of the hair.

Are there any specific questions I should be asking? & any helpful tips/products? T
Thanks!:)"
EloquentElixir,qz1vg5,Glad you found something that works for you!
GoodyOldie_20,qz1vg5,"Looks so pretty, moisturized and defined!"
justfloating_,qz1vg5,Your hair looks so nice ! Cutting out the oils and butters transformed my hair too. I have UFD and the other gels you mentioned and I’m excited to try them out as toppers over UFD over my next few washes !
kelthuzad12,qz1vg5,"Another wash and go success! 4 products. No oils, creams, or butters&&&I've been using Ecoslay products the last couple weeks and have been having great success, but I am really attributing the outcome to the fact that I've cut out raw oils, butters, and creams from my regimen. My wash days consist of:

 *  **Shampoo**: Ecoslay peppermint schnapps
 *  **Conditioner**: Ecoslay Banana Cream (used while I'm the shower after wash, and with a shower cap while bathing then rinsed out)
 *  **Gel**: Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic & The Doux gel (normally I use Ecoslay Jello Shot, but I'm all out and needed to try something else until my order arrives)
 *  Set hair with diffuser until gel cast starts to form, then finish drying with soft bonnet attached to blow dryer

I wash my hair twice a week since I sweat like crazy when working out, but I've been able to get 4 days out of a wash and go. Before I could never have my hair last over night. It would be frizzy, dry, and very tangle prone.

Now it's still very soft and moisturized on wash day.

I sleep with a satin bonnet on at night.

I'll update with photos each day until I wash again.

[Day 0](https://iili.io/5SOuSV.jpg)
[Day 1 - I really need a pick or something to fluff these smushed spots. The hold with these gels just doesn't compare to Ecoslay](https://iili.io/5U748x.jpg)

[Bonus photo: My friend stopped by today and let me do her hair too lol](https://iili.io/5SLOKB.jpg)&&&Thank you! Me too, because I was really about to call it quits with natural hair and get it relaxed when I found Ecoslay.&&&Thank you 😊&&&I just need my jello shot to hurry up and get here because these others just do not have the hold I like"

_charliezena,qytot0,Woww that looks soo good
asphyxxia_,qytot0,"Haha, I was absolutely looking for a sign. I got a really short cut almost a year ago now because my hair was très damaged.. Even though I totally looked like a little boy when I got it, I'm majorly considering another cut rn because I've got missing spots due to new meds and trich. It just takes so long to grow. :') 
I'm new to being mostly natural, and idk what to do with my hair anymore, so I appreciate the routine!!

TLDR: I definitely needed a sign and some (maybe inadvertent) encouragement, so thank you for this! lol. ♡"
attackofthefupacabra,qytot0,Just gorgeous sis thank you for sharing 😍❤️
beccbeccs,qytot0,"A compilation of why every natural needs to go short at least ONCE😍&&&&&&Oh my gosh girl you absolutely won’t look like a man! There are so many shapes&cuts that look feminine and beautiful
Heart shaped, round, taper, asymmetric cuts etc they’re all lovely! Hope it goes well for you💕&&&Hey everyone!! 
If you have long hair and are itching to cut it, but you’re worried abt how it’ll look, do it!!! It grows back!! Have fun with you hair!! 

For the longest time I’ve wanted to go for a short haircut but was too scared of what people will say/ losing my length etc but nah black women can go short by choice!! It grows back anyway so might as well have fun and it looks SOOOO good on everyone. I’ve never seen a black women with a short hair cut that looked bad, everrrr. Always looking fresh and fly 
So if you’re looking for a sign, this is it💕💕💕

P.S routine is shampoo, condition and use gel to curl!&&&Yes!! And it’s also really fun when it’s short, that feeling of newly cut ends is amazing&&&🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽&&&Thank you!!&&&Happy to share!!&&&😍😍&&&Thanks!!&&&Thank you dear 💕&&&I think getting a good stylist helps the most so they can adjust the hair cut as it grows out. I cut it 3 months ago and I have an appointment in January to shape it up just so it grows even

Honestly if you just keep the back a short while growing it out the shape will always look nice!!&&&Go for it!! Have lots of pics of what you want and show a stylist. You won’t regret!&&&Thanks!!!&&&I’d encourage you to look up different stylists in your area and see what their portfolio is, then take as many pics as you can of what exactly you want (also if it helps take pics of what you don’t want either so nothing gets lost in translation). I showed my stylist and he was able to give it to me&&&Yayyyy! How is it? Are you enjoying it? Every time the back and sides grow I wanna go even shorter!&&&Thank you dear x"
flirtandflutter,qytot0,"You learn so much about your hair growing it out from scratch, with all new/healthy growth."
graceyperkins,qytot0,This is so great! I grew frustrated and cut about four inches off my hair a month ago. It seemed like my professional cuts always look the same (plus Covid I don’t want to go to a salon). I may try this cut myself.
hanap8127,qytot0,Yes! I’ve been wanting a taper for years. Finally did it 3 months ago.
medicinal_carrots,qytot0,"Omg YAS KWEEN 😻🙀👏🏾
I love the shape. I always have such a hard time shaping mine as it gets longer/bigger."

HisPkami,qyp9dw,"Low porosity and 3c-4 hair with a Citrus allergy&&&My hair has multiple textures, so first off oof there. However, I have a concern. It's very hair for me to find product let alone products for low porosity without Limonene.

Vivid_Hedgehog_8210,qyj3ty,Your skin is like perfect… what’s your routine?
OMGSafeword,qyiu8c,I had those braids and I did a side braid or “rolled” it back and pinned with straight pins. You could also do a half up half down style to keep it out of your face.
Raygerdanger,qyiu8c,Not at all! This is gorgeous. I always loved her braided hairstyles
SugarsDimples,qyiu8c,Absolutely not!
YourDadThinksImCool,qyiu8c,"Would this hairstyle look stupid in reality?&&&&&&Yeah but.. again.. I don't know how she got the braids to stay to one eye while standing.. yet when she bent over it covers Over half of her face.. which I don't know if I like.

Will I look like the grudge girl? 😩&&&Like I love the way it looks on her.. but I worry if it will fall too much even past the other half of the face it's covering. Like it would cover over 1/2 of my face. I don't understand how she gets it to stay to one side when she's standing up.


Any help?&&&Now you tell me! 😭"
flirtandflutter,qyiu8c,"This is a styled shoot where every hair is carefully placed before taking the photo. I would look for photos of this style on regular people or (better yet) in motion, maybe look for a youtube video."
hippeemom,qyiu8c,Any knotless styles are cute but do not get the loose hair on the bottom they get so nappy. Makes the whole look ugly ash in a week.
BlackThatsAll,qyi69z,"That’s likely a wig, so you don’t have to heat your own hair for this."
OMGSafeword,qyi69z,How do I achieve this hairstyle?&&&I love this hairstyle Megan the Stallion wore [here](https://twitter.com/hourlyblkhottie/status/1462130862498226179?s=21). The bang doesn’t look super slicked down (so I’m not thinking it’s a gel keeping it in place) but I have a coarse hair texture (read: 4c hair). I’m thinking Italian yaki ponytail piece chopped and curled but for the bang is it left out hair that’s been pressed and moussed? I know how to navigate heat on my hair but this hairstyle is confusing me lmao. I also hate having hair pressed on my forehead :/
