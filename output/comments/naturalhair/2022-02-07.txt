BeautyOfaWolf,ss2608,I make my own oils as well. It's the coconut oil that u used. It hardens in cooler temps and melts down with enough heat. I'm guessing it was the unrefined version which is the best but this is the reason. Once u rub it into your hands it should melt down again. Or just apply a little heat to your mixture using a bowl of warm water and setting your oil container in it.
HelpfulJuice2,ss2608,"Handmade Aloe Vera Oil&&&Hey, I just made some Aloe Vera Oil using the Aloe Vera leaf, coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, and black Jamaican castor oil.

I've noticed that it thickened as if it was candle wax drying as it cools. Is that supposed to happen? Also, The rice water I've used today made my house smell wild."
CoupleOfFreaksXxX,srydao,I was saying this too!!
Lelemcgeegee,srydao,Looked really good
ebknowsflows,srydao,"yo am i crazy or did Kendrick say his infamous lyric ""hate po po""?? its censored in the official stream and most seem to think he omitted it. but i was watching on a streaming service and i could swear that he said it. could anyone who was streaming it back me up on that? im wondering if he was censored in real time on the tv broadcast??"
mindblowningshit,srydao,Appreciation Post for Kendricks braids. He was moving so fast I couldn't get any other good pics of his super bowl half time performance hair style but his braids were so fresh 😍&&&&&&Yess I knew I saw stars and I couldn't get a good dang photo. Thanks for the added details and crossposting! I love him and wish we had another show to look fwd to! Lol I'd watch him perform while getting his hair braided on stage 🤣
starrgazin,srydao,"The hairstylist created Stars and Stripes!  LOVED THIS!  The parts are so crispy and the braids so fresh. His stylist is def the mvp for this. He looked great. I loved seeing him but then his braids took it to a whole other level. Great work!

Edit: I thought this should be on r/kendricklamar so I added it… I absolutely adore Kendrick. I hope no one is offended in either end."
54never,srq18h,Is it okay that when I pick out my hair I get a few hairs attached to the hair pick&&&[removed]
fivetenash,srq18h,"This question gets posted several times a week. If you search the subreddit and read those other posts, you will see it’s fine. Hair sheds naturally."
fwja1,srq18h,"if it’s just a little bit it’s nothin to worry about, just natural shedding"
2Mona94,srnyrs,Go for it and update us please
9shycat,srnyrs,"It would look great! If you’ve never dyed your hair before it will be an easy dye job and probably very vibrant. However, just keep in mind that red/ copper is one of the harder colors to maintain, you’ll probably have to keep dying it every couple months to keep the vibrancy if not it’ll fade out to like a brown."
AnnaBananna3,srnyrs,I’d go for a more natural look on the ginger side if you want some warmth
ArtistWriter,srnyrs,Bruh it would look so good on you!!!!
Bookish_Kitten,srnyrs,The Curlsmith copper or red hair gel would be good to try in your hair if you want to get an idea of if it would look good. Washes out just fine. My mother used it to get an idea and it worked out well.
BoredInThaHouse419,srnyrs,Try a filter on sc or something and try coloured wax and then if you like it I don’t see why you shouldn’t go ahead and dye it. I think it’d look cool
Ghettocherreies,srnyrs,use colored hair wax or gel so it doesn't damage your hair and it's temporary.
GubBlub_,srnyrs,"I promise you it would, that copper color looks great on every black girl I've seen. I had my hair that color for a little over a year but recently dyed it black/brown bc bleaching roots is a lot of upkeep but totally worth it!"
Late-Instruction-615,srnyrs,You're very beautiful so any color will look great imo 🙂&&&You're welcome 🙂
NoMoreCooties,srnyrs,It’s already got a red base. maybe just punch it up with some caramel highlights and give it some dimension🤷‍♀️
Pretty_princess1996,srnyrs,"I say try some temporary color wax first to help you decide if you really want it red before going in with permanent dye, but I think it’d look good"
RareSugar3188,srnyrs,It would look great on you! You're gorgeous.
SmallFrie9108,srnyrs,You’re literally gorgeous and I think anything would work with your skin tone.
ValuableAggressive10,srnyrs,"Do it! It would compliment your skin tone beautifully, and give you an edgy sophisticated look 😏. I would like to suggest a dye though, if you're able to choose. Revlon high color was my go to when I dyed mine red. I didn't have to bleach it and my hair was still soft afterwards. I can show you before and after if you like!"
caketaint,srnyrs,"I think you and your hair are very beautiful as is but if you wanna do it, go for it! You could probably rock just about any color."
crabbypattieformula,srnyrs,GO FOR IT!!!!
deejeyteejey,srnyrs,I vote for do it
folkoono,srnyrs,I reckon it'd really suit you! You can always dye it back if you don't like it.
impressive-girl,srnyrs,this is my natural hair. I’m thinking of dying it red/copper but I’m not sure if it will look good on me. Will appreciate if you can help me decide.&&&&&&I’ve never tried that before. Will i be able to see the color without bleaching?&&&I’m worried it might damage my hair that’s why I’ve been really thinking too much about it. Thanks for the positive words!&&&Can you actually see the color without bleaching?&&&This is so sweet! Thank you! 🥺❤️&&&Thank you! ❤️&&&How was your bleaching experience? Did it damage your natural hair?&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you! ❤️&&&I would appreciate that! Please show me! I’m thinking it might require me to bleach but if this product really works without bleaching then that’s better option for me. I’ve never tried bleaching and I’m scared to do it hahaha&&&Thank you! I appreciate thisn&&&I’ve actually dyed my hair before but without bleaching and it just got brownish. The reason I’ve been contemplating so much about this is cause i want to bleach my hair before dying it red.
micahsimmons01,srnyrs,Girllll you are gorgeoussss and anything that you do will look AMAZING!
mmrlng,srnyrs,"No. Don't. You're beautiful just the way you are. Sometimes you want something different. So you change yr coupe, or haircolour. I get it. But don't change."
reesespuffsreeses,srnyrs,"It would look great, but your natural hair is also soooo pretty!!! Do whatever you think fits your personality back. At the end of the day, I tell myself ""its just hair"" and I usually will try fun colors."
sqwzmahmeatybts,srnyrs,Another vote for GO FOR IT!

JomoGolfR,srgfzk,Love it very beautiful
Kindly_Coyote,srgfzk,The natural fro : Enjoy all of that fullness and thickness while you can. Hair thins out with age.

deejeyteejey,srgfzk,🔥🔥🔥
fitnesstrappin,srgfzk,Crochet Afro vs Natural Afro&&&&&&Aww thank you! 🤗&&&Thank you! I used Rastafri Bahama Curl Crochet Hair and this hair was in for a while so it looked more natural.
slowslowjane,srgfzk,I personally always love a natural fro and it really frames your face but you look great in both! And I’m seeing and admiring all those muscles you got sis 🙌🏽
Suspicious_Depth_623,srefa9,It really depends on the condition of your hair. 3 months of growth is a good place to start and your stylist can help you assess your hair health from that point
darrlaflare,srefa9,When To Start Trimming?&&&I’m a male & just started growing my hair Jan. 2021. I was wondering when would be the proper time to start getting trims? My hair gets frizzy & knotted so fast & I was wondering if getting it trimmed would help with that.
t-swish-sweetie,srefa9,"I normally do every 3 months or 6 months, just depends on how my hair is behaving at the time 😌"
AnnieRob1996,srdt5o,"Walmart, Sally’s"
BibliophileMary,srdt5o,I'd got mine from Family Dollar.
Experiment626__,srdt5o,sorry if this is a dumb question but Where do yall buy your bonnets from?&&&
Jetshark970,srdt5o,Amazon
StonedKitten-420,srdt5o,The recycled fabric shop. 😅 I make my own.
ilove-purple,srdt5o,walmart or local beauty supply
ontariodwarf,srdt5o,"Amazon has the best ones I’ve found but in a pinch (usually, when traveling and I forgot mine) I’ve gotten some at Sally beauty. Some Target stores have them (depends on the demographics of where the target is lol)"
oreo9991,srdt5o,Shein
rnountdiablo,srdt5o,There's great bonnets on Etsy if you like supporting small business
twenan,srdt5o,"any local beauty supply store! though i got my recent one at target, i just don’t like the way it feels (elastic seems too tight?)"
EchoHaunting925,sr6uy7,"I would definitely avoid heat of any kind and learn to work with your texture, at least while it is recovering.  Good luck!"
blackporsche22,sr6uy7,"If you're thinking about blow drying, what I find really helpful is putting some Argan oil on my hair as a heat protectant (a little expensive but there are other good oils that protect your hair from high heat). I've just recently came upon this and I haven't damaged my hair once. I blow dry about once a month, and they could last a whole week if I twist or braid it up at night."
laurchelle,sr6uy7,"How often should I blow dry?&&&Been tryna to upgrade my hair regimen after finding out two of my products is causing my hair to dry and break off, I was wondering if I should hop back into blow outs as my styling after 7 months of no heat? If so, how often? How long would it last? Any **affordable** product recommendations to help my dry hair?"
Independent_Ad8963,sr65dd,From the looks of it you can. I do get this hairstyle but mine is full on afro and it looks really cute but I usually get this before I start my wash day. The way I get this is from over separating my week old 3 strand twist out. Hair starts to get frizzy. If you're separating hair for a style oil your hands before you separate it'll help with not creating too much frizz.
Intrepid_Watch_3652,sr65dd,Could I get my hair like Mikey Williams and what’s his hairtype&&&&&&I don’t know how to separate my hair and&&&If you don’t mind me asking what’s your hair type
wj2smooth,sr65dd,Yeah just show your barber this haircut style
KEnyinna,sr5ztr,You need a good trim. All off the thin ends need to be cut.
Miriam-Esi,sr5ztr,Go to a hair stylist
RandomWeebBitch,sr5ztr,My hair looks very sparse at the end and thick at the root. Is it damaged?&&&
goodwellnessguide,sr5ztr,I would say yes.  [Hair Revital X](https://mwebolive.com/5624/3826/6/?) can really help you restore a healthy hair
ontariodwarf,sr5ztr,"Like others have mentioned, it looks like you have split ends that have traveled up the shaft and caused breakage, but there are other causes of breakage, too. Maybe a trim would help for now and you’d need to make sure to trim regularly in the future and assess what you’re doing in your routine that could be causing so much stress on the hair (rough detangling, product buildup and drying out, high tension styles, etc)"
slicx18,sr5ztr,"I would wet it and brush it, If it looks stringy when it’s wet then it’s damage"
sqwzmahmeatybts,sr5ztr,I also think it’s splits and possibly you getting healthier/less stressed in the past few months that account for this.
toe_bean_z,sr5ztr,"Split ends, I would say. Split ends in curly and coily hair can look different than split ends in straight/straightened hair."
Exact_Cricket_3031,sr5fjo,"No raw oils/butters challenge🤨…&&&So I’ve done the 30 day hair detox from Iamblackgirlcurls and it went soooo well! My hair is collar bone length at the back and a little below my chin at the front and low porosity for reference. I’d advice everyone to try it out now I’m boutta detox my colon🤣🥳&&&Ikr and my hair is way softer and more manageable now I love it here🥳&&&I do online school so I wash every 7-10 days I honestly just wash when my hair is dry

So for example I washed on a Sunday and put in twists using mousse then Wednesday I take the twists down and wear a twist out and by Sunday it got frizzy so time to wash again"
Micki-Micki,sr5fjo,I detoxed in the fall and I haven’t looked back. I wash my hair no less than once a week. I don’t use oils or butters and my hair is the best it’s ever been.
PunkGF,sr5fjo,"Thanks for posting your experience! Most questions/problems people have on here can be addressed by stopping with raw oils and butters and just regularly shampooing and conditioning hair. People love to down vote me when I suggest this lol. Like look, you’re the one coming on here struggling, not me."
notafrequentflyerr,sr5fjo,"Did this last year and my hair is so great now, in hindsight it seems so silly to put raw butter and oil on hair because they don’t come out with shampoo and it just keeps building up on your hair."
thatgirllisa,sr5fjo,"I started in the Fall also! I just purged most of my hair products. Will be doing another purge soon. Not only has my hair improved, I’ve saved lots of money and have more space in my bathroom cabinets. Lol"
velvetvagine,sr5fjo,What does your weekly schedule/maintenance look like?
Disastrous_Can4962,sr57nh,"if it was damaged from relaxers that is not your real curl pattern.

I can tell you your curl pattern when you grow it out naturally, and upload a photo freshly washed without any product. let it air dry half way so it can shrink some. it will shrink to its natural curl pattern.then upload the pic

that being said on the picture I wld say...type 4a"
Puzzleheaded_Buy_849,sr57nh,Can anyone tell what hair type this is? I took this photo before I chopped off my hair which was damaged from relaxers&&&&&&Thank you! I definitely will. I will wait until my hair grows out some more
Disastrous_Can4962,sr2b33,"questions to ask yourself: 

what are your hair goals? how long do you want to grow it? do you want to rock a fro sometimes?(you cant with locs shld you want them when it grows out).

Your hair is 'type 4/low porosity/high density'. that is the standard for Black hair. (somebody will comment abt how its not, and some heads have 3 different type 4 textures(type 4a,4b,4c), but you will know your hair sections as it grows out. and they will all be type 4 which means they will all have the same needs as the other type 4's in your head)

all that is to say buy shampoo/condish that is formulated for type 4 hair. 

shampoos with sulfates shld be used to thoroughly cleanse the hair sometimes. Pantene 2/1 is my favorite."
Kindly_Coyote,sr2b33,"You are at a lucky stage now. With each new growing  length, I found my self using different products to get the style I wanted."
Magicalbeing-30,sr2b33,I wish I could help but I switched products so often when I first cut my hair over a year ago. The only thing I can really say is you really get to learn your hair when you start fresh like this. I also found myself washing my hair a lot more when it was short. It seemed to get dirty faster for some reason.
cocolanoire,sr2b33,Don’t waste your money buying lots of products. First do the hair porosity test and start your regimen from there. It will save you a lot of money and time. Also check out YouTubers with you hair texture and porosity for tips
reinethepen,sr2b33,"Shaved my head to restart my natural hair journey a month ago. Looking for tips, hair products I should use, etc. Thanks in advance!&&&&&&Thank you for all of this. 

Ideally, I’d like it to be shoulder length ish or longer, once it gets to a certain point I’ll likely braid/twist it most of the time, in a fro the rest of the time. 

I’ll give the Pantene a try :)"
Blaque-Cat,sr23f5,"The tightness of your cools has nothin to to do with how often you wash your hair. It’s typical to shampoo and condition twice a week for those with curly hair that are active. If you feel the need to wash your hair three times per week, use a gentle shampoo/co-wash (an actual co-wash that cleanses, not just conditioner) in place of your usual shampoo."
Nadaleenatasha,sr23f5,This question is only for those with 4c hair who exercise regularly. How often do you shampoo and condition your hair?&&&&&&Thanks a lot. And you feel that co-washing adds moisture right? Do you also detangle when you co-wash?
ndilapha,sr23f5,"I shampoo and dc once a week and co-wash at least once inbetween. If my hair feels dry before washday,  I co-wash again."
ALyttleH,sr1rn8,Not to me!
AdFit9500,sr1rn8,"I think it depends. Hair being detangled after 5-7 days no. Seeing this more often, I think is too much."
Cocoa_D,sr1rn8,I don’t think so. It looks like you have a pretty healthy head of hair!
KEnyinna,sr1rn8,Seems normal.
MusicPhonatic,sr1rn8,"That is completely normal. You could lose less for sure. But if this is happening every week, you're good!"
amorsitomio,sr1rn8,Is this excessive shedding?&&&
fivetenash,sr1rn8,Post removed.
godlywinter,sr1rn8,Mines about the same. I’d monitor your shed hairballs week by week if this is a concern for you
jclassic100,sr1rn8,Not to me. I wash once a week and this is usually what I get when I pre-poo/detangle.
54never,sr0yqk,Does anyone know of a good braiding gel with a very mild light scent&&&Just looking for a braiding gel with the least scent possible.&&&I totally understand you
DotHOHM,sr0yqk,You can look into the new fragrance free line from Curl Smith. Maybe one of the gels/pomade whatever is strong enough for braiding.
platform__crocs,sr0yqk,watching bc i am so sensitive to scents which makes a lot of hair styling inaccessible to me
