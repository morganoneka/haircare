Lelemcgeegee,qu7ylv,Man I'm so sorry that happened! She sounds so unprofessional! I go to a salon that specializes in natural/ curly hair. I love their service. But I also get that it's hard to get sleek ponys and other fun styles.
bubblegumsparkles,qu7ylv,Sounds like my experience. I learned how to do my own hair
head_MD,qu7ylv,"I‚Äôm done with stylists.&&&This weekend I had a special trip planned, so decided to get my hair done in a simple ponytail for the occasion. I haven‚Äôt had my hair done since May, which left me unhappy but I was optimistic this time.

The day before my appointment I took the time to wash, just to detangle my hair. I don‚Äôt use oils, and wash/condition every 3-5 days. My hair is high density and I sweat a lot, so I apply one product, dry, and put it into a puff cuff. 

My appointment time comes and this stylist texts me that she‚Äôs going to be THIRTY MINUTES late. Not a problem, I‚Äôm understanding and have the time. She shows up and I tell her my hair might still be damp in the middle because I washed and and detangled the day prior and applied a product. So I slept ONE NIGHT on my hair. 

She starts parting my hair dry, and I guess she figures that she doesn‚Äôt need to wash it, and goes in to style. I‚Äôve had many sleek ponytails, and the foundation of any style is a freshly washed head. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúokay whatever, she‚Äôs the licensed one.‚Äù She sprays my hair damp and goes through with a BLOW DRYER. 

The end of the service I‚Äôm quite happy with the product! Cute and sleek. She informs me that I have to pay a $35 detangling fee. This is after I paid a deposit already for the appointment. And after she was thirty minutes late. And after she didn‚Äôt even wash my damn hair. 

I was low key quietly humiliated because I‚Äôm natural and have been for a long time, and actually took the time out to detangle my hair. My hair will never not have some tangles in it, but had she took some water to it she would have realized it was fine. 

After paying $80 for the service, $35 for a fee, and a tip, I didn‚Äôt feel great. I obviously won‚Äôt be returning, but I‚Äôm not going back to stylists AGAIN. It sucks because I love to support people who have talent but fuck that bitch.

Edit: Cherry on top? The appointment isn‚Äôt listed under my past appointments on StyleSeat, so I can‚Äôt even leave a review. Wonderful.&&&It was one of those places that rents salon spaces to different people, so not like an in house stylist really. I went because she‚Äôs close to me and it was super convenient. Wondering if I should leave a review there lol"
rossablue,qu7ylv,This was at a salon? I‚Äôm surprised at your mention of paying a deposit. I suggest finding a reputable natural hair stylist in your area.
Evercrimson,qu5wvh,That looks super damn cute. I love that length.
Head_Anything1177,qu5wvh,Looking great!
Infinite-Swordfish97,qu5wvh,Good growth!!

fwuteloop,qu42qq,I keep seeing that Aussie deep conditioner everywhere!! How hydrating would you say it is?
joiejojojo,qu42qq,I like the simple routine! How often do you clarify?
poochee_pansy,qu42qq,"4C wash day.&&&&&&Rightfully so! My hair tends to be really dry even when I spray it with water or use a leave in, but after I use the DC my hair is so soft and hydrated and holds moisture better. The results were most noticeable after I'd used it for a few weeks. I didn't think I'd like it but it's definitely worth a try.&&&1. Shampoo twice with warm water and Garnier Fructis Grow Strong Shampoo.

2. Squeeze excess water out of hair and apply strongly brewed black tea to the scalp and Aussie Moist 3-Minute Miracle DC to the hair. That DC is literally the only thing that gives me definition and I have to wash it out smh. It's Jheri Curl x10 when I brush through it a lot to separate the curls.

3. Let sit for forty-five minutes with shower cap.

4. Rinse with cool water.

5. Done!

I think I might post how I moisturize and do my loose twists or another style later on. Please ask questions if you're curious about anything.&&&Thanks! I've cut down over time and found the necessary procedures for me. I've fallen into the routine of cowashing once every week-ish for three weeks and shampooing at the end of the month. That might change when I get a new cowash though."
Secretmindset,qu3e6n,My hair is always braided & the ends have never been cut. I want a longer and fuller look any suggestions?&&&
M_Sia,qu3dxg,Me when I have worn my hair out days in a row without detangling&&&When I‚Äôm able to do protective styles well enough without looking like a girl version of Travis Scott or Kodak Black then I would do more of them.

Nastykay,qtziw5,Help. I have been keeping my hair natural for about 7 years I cut it about once a year. NO HEAT - NOT EVEN A BLOW DRYER. I want to set a consistent regimen of hair care. I also need help defining my hair texture. Thank you&&&
fivetenash,qtziw5,"We cannot tell your hair type from this photo. 

Here's a hair type quiz I found on Google: [https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)"
honghonger,qtyuam,"How to preserve my short curls at night when nothing else works?&&&Hi! I'm kind of new to this natural hair thing, and I'm really struggling with preserving my curls at night. I have short 3c hair. My hair barely reaches my shoulders, so I really can't do the pineapple method, and scarfs or just throwing a bonnet on never work for me. No matter what I do my curls end up frizzy and matted, causing me to have to completely redo my hair in the morning which is time consuming. Any recommendations would help!"
justfloating_,qtyuam,"I have short hair too and I wear a buff, it‚Äôs like a big open sock and it holds my hair in place well

https://www.amazon.com/s?k=buff&crid=HONIM68K13GW&sprefix=buff%2Caps%2C148&ref=nb_sb_noss_2"
madisonsj,qtyuam,I put my hair into 5 or 6 mini puffballs using scrunchies and put a bonnet on top. in the morning I put oil on my hands and take out the scrunchies and fluff it out gently. It can get a little frizzy but this method keeps my curls in tact for at least a week. let me know if you have any questions
9shycat,qtyapc,"First of all, your big chop looks great on you! Shea moisture changed a lot of their formulas a while back and they haven‚Äôt really worked for me since for the same reason, just way too drying. Their conditioner maaaay be ok but I would consider using an alternative shampoo for sure. From my experience, I learned I have to be really picky with shampoos because they can  the most drying moisture sucking component of a regiment. Just look for something with minimal ingredients especially foaming agents like sodium laureth sulfates. 

Right now I wash weekly with a very gentle black soap or an ACV rinse. ACV rinse really helps restore your scalps PH.

As for leave in conditioner, I recommend Kinky Curly‚Äôs knot today. It was my go to when transitioning years ago. It was the only thing that would actually give my hair slip and help me actually detangle. 
OKAY Pure Naturals also makes good leave ins. 

Goodluck on your journey, hope you find the perfect products for you!"
AcDoesGames,qtyapc,I did a big chop in august but my hair doesnt seem to be keeping moisture. I use Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Then other moisture products. I wash once a week. Any tips/products? Also hair type? I'm not sure what my type is. (Ps ignore my face)&&&&&&I've never used a gel!! I will definitely look into it. Thank you!&&&Omg stop thank youuuuu üôÉü§ó&&&Thank you so much! I will definitely be looking into your recommendation!!&&&Thank you!
EloquentElixir,qtyapc,"I cant say for sure what type you are, but you seem to be mostly 4 with a few 3c strands in there I think. I'm type 4 and the only products that work for me after shampooing/conditioning are Taaliah Waajid Curly Curl Cream or Kinky Curly Curling Custard. I use one or the other but not both at the same time.

TWCCC is really thick compared to other creams like African Pride Curling Cream, which does nothing for me moisture wise or forming my curls."
Pinkpatha,qtyapc,Girllll try mielle!!! My mom used this paired with biotin and her hair has been growing crazy. I only use Mielle and Miss Jessie‚Äôs. Try a LOC or LCO method. Leave in Oil Cream. I do this without biotin and my hair loves it
Symj89,qtyapc,I can‚Äôt ignore your face because it‚Äôs beautiful
etherealmeadows,qtyapc,"Hair type isn‚Äôt really important, what‚Äôs important is learning your density I suggest partnering with a curl specialist so you can get personalized advice. But shea moisture is a bad quality brand that‚Äôs full of oils and butters try to avoid shampoo and conditioners with them in the first 5 ingredients also this is a process it‚Äôs gonna take a while for your hair to become hydrated I suggest looking up Jenniferrosenyc on twitter and see some curls for more advice good luck on your hair journey!!"
jadrose1440,qtyapc,"Our texture looks really similar, I really like spritzing my hair with water and olive oil and then using a leave in. Right now I‚Äôm loving suave mango butter and castor oil cream, very inexpensive as well. I Also deep condition with it‚Äôs a 10 miracle hair mask ever few weeks as well."
trinilena1,qtyapc,Your hair might do better with a gel. My hair does not like creams at all.  I suggest kinky curly gel over a moisturizer leave in like Briogio.
EloquentElixir,qtxgzd,"They're really easy. I just find the natural parts in my hair and twist those, so it doesn't come out like this. But if you want neater parts its not hard either"
Rex2land,qtxgzd,For those of you who do two strand twists to your own hair how difficult is it to do? I heard that it is much easier to do than box braids but is it easy to do yourself?? I want to have hair like in the picture.&&&
SignificantSpring670,qtxgzd,"It's not hard. May take some time depending on how big or small they are. For me, parting my hair is the hardest and takes the longest"
girl-w-glasses,qtxgzd,Superrrr easy. Definitely easy than braids. You can do it! Look at YT videos.
sisyphus753,qtxgzd,"Not hard. As others said, parting is probably the hardest part since you can‚Äôt really see the lines yourself. Once that‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs pretty simple."
EloquentElixir,qtukfp,"Youre probably hurting yourself with the oils and protein treatments. For me, oil can only exist in products. If it's raw oil on my hair or scalp, it gets rejected, no if ands or buts. Type 4 hair is sensitive to protein, you've probably overload your hair, especially if no products are getting it.

If your hair feels tough, is hard to part, has no elasticity, feels super dry...you have protein overload. 

Also, simplicity is key. I used to do A LOT to my hair; prepooing, hot oil treatments, clay masks...and although it did help my hair grow, my hair grows pretty much the same doing the bare minimum. I wash and DC my hair, then leave it I twists for at least 2-3 weeks. Grows like weeds. The only problem I have is finding what keeps my hair moisturized after I shower, because if I add any products before my custard to twist my hair I get flakes."
IntelligentLab9,qtukfp,"My last effort before I big chop. Hair literally refuses to EVER cooperate&&&I've been trying to grow my hair out since lockdown started. It has been absolute HELL dealing with my head. It's low porosity, doesn't absorb anything, gets matted every single time I go to sleep (even with a shower cap) and basically refuses to grow. It's been at the same length for a month and a half now despite  frequent oil and protein treatments. (which is supposed to give your hair the nutrients it needs to grow faster?) And on top of all this my hair doesn't even grow evenly across my head. For the next 2 weeks maybe I will ONLY wash my hair to get rid of dandruff and to get rid of dryness . If I don't see any sort of difference with how my hair behaviors I'm completely chopping it off. This was more of a vent then it was a question or productive post I apologize&&&I did a little research and it seems like all the good I was attempting to do for my hair was simply just too much and hurting it substantially in the short and long term. I have been making the same mistake as you by using  a lot of ""sulfate-shampoos"" and combined with over-hydrating my hair with water and oils hyper-frequently in an effort to make it ""healthy and long"" I was doing the complete opposite. After shampooing and conditioning my hair, I tried using some Shea-Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie and all my hair did was absorb it and gave me no definition and I just ended up with a lot of frizz; all side-effects of Moisture Overload. I'm going to slow down on the products and stick to co-washing as necessary and the occasional protein treatment when I feel my hair is losing it's body. Thanks for the input!"
etherealmeadows,qtukfp,Hi go on twitter search Jenniferrosenyc and if possible try to find a curl specialist in your area
shinydolleyes,qtukfp,"What are you actually doing to your hair?  Do you have specific products you're using on a routine basis?  Constantly using oils really isn't necessary and neither is constant protein treatment.  Matter of fact, constant protein might be working against you.  Protein just makes your hair hard and difficult to work with and can even lead to breakage if you use too much of it.  If anything your hair needs moisturizing, not protein, and no, oil is not a moisturizer.  Water-based products add moisture and hydration. I second the recommendation to look up Black Girl Curls and Wash Your Damn hair.  Even if you don't like their entire way of thinking, it will put you on a better path than where you are now. 

All you should really need is a good moisturizing shampoo, a clarifying to use when needed (you shouldn't really need to clarify every week), and a good conditioner.  I haven't found an ""Instant"" rinse out conditioner I like and prefer to deep condition regularly, but at the very least, you'll want to find a conditioner, that works for you.  Then you'll want a styler:  a gel, foam or even if it really works for you, a custard that will help you style your hair.  I have a few favorites.  I""m not going to outline all of Black Girl Curls here, but definitely do some research into them because it sounds like if nothing else they can give you the framework you need."

Forgivenlight,qtsoy8,"Get a low fade or drop fade.
But stop cutting of ur moustacheüò≠. Get it shaped and trimmed nicely"
__skipper5000,qtsoy8,I have a mushroom-style curly fro and I didn't cut my sides. Sometimes I kind of wish I had a drop fade but sometimes I really like the look of a full head of hair. I would say let your hair grow and then decide if you want a drop fade.
jnee23,qtsoy8,Save yourself money and grow out your whole head. If you get a fade you have to get a cut atleast once every two weeks so it doesn‚Äôt look like trash

icruiselife,qtq1wm,Chebe oil as a hot oil treatment will put moisture back into the hair. I  also use a purple conditioner 2x a week to keep my hair toned and soft. Hope this helps
justfloating_,qtq1wm,Olaplex treatments will help rebuild the bonds and keeping your hair hydrated ( shampoo & condition weekly) . It‚Äôs best that you partner with someone trained in colour especially if you‚Äôre going platinum as there is a certain type of care required with bleached hair  . They will put you on to the best deep conditioners and treatments required. You will also need trims more regularly too

If you can splurge, I would highly highly recommend the Joico Hydrator (it's pricier), I usually get the 1L for $30 (works out to $1/oz) instead of their smaller sizes and it lasts me a couple months. I've heard good things about Joico moisture recovery balm.

Lastly, Sallys is having a [4 for $20 sale](https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-all-hair-care/?prefn1=Promotion&prefv1=Buy%204%20for%20%2420&prefn2=hairType&prefv2=Treatments) right now and Texture ID Coil mask and deep treatment masks are bomb.
