Monchi09,7tpww5,"I use a silk bonnet (only like 3 dollars from Walmart) and real shit I braid my hair every night and pull it out, then comb with my pick(with tgtn daily moisturizer and a sealing oil) in the morning. I have an afro so i noticed thought-out my natural hair phase there was less breakage when I braid at night ( i just add water and either sweet almond oil or jojoba oil)
But honestly... You need to have self-compassion for yourself and your hair growth. Dont focus on every.single.thing. your hair does, just let it do its thing and as strange as it sounds, communicate with your hair. I like to view my hair as a marriage with just a love-hate relationship haha but enjoy your journey! "
babbibaby,7tpww5,"Silk bonnet, silk pillowcase. The durag probably flattened your hair when you woke but not anything permanent. 

"
carelesswhisperr,7tpww5,"At night I wear a silk scarf/bonnet but half of the week I refresh it with a water/leave in/ detangler/oil combo in a spray bottle and put it in twists under that. That's MTW

Then for my lazy half I put front half in a top ponytail and wrap the bottom half in a scarf (first tie is in the front, second tie is up around the ponytail in the back). That's ThFS. 

Wash day Sunday. 

Depending on how your hair dries out will determine how little or how much you should be messing with it, and in what ways, at night. The general rule is less is more. But always sleeping with your hair out will make it matted and tangled. I admit the later half of the week, my hair loses definition and dries out faster, but at that point I'm more likely to put it in a puff or a protective style. 

I wrote a super long comment about determining porosity and some products/tips about a week back. Dunno how to link it on my phone but it's in my profile somewhere. Hope it helps! Good luck! :)"
jonnyp200,7tpww5,"What NOT to do with natural hair // what do I wear at night/how to manage&&&So.. July 15, 2017.. I cut all my shit off. I gotta admit... it was pretty fucked up. I was determined to grow my hair for two years but I managed to fuck it up around the 7 month time line.

What did I do wrong... well... first, I thought I was ""too good"" for split ends and I doubted that  I would get them. So I went 7 months without getting a trim and I started to notice it around the 7 month timeline. My hair looked like absolute SHIT in its curly state. Then, my dumbass got curious and straightened it and got severe heat damaged. It's like the heat damage spread throughout my hair.

Also, I wore my durag like 24/7 and I'm pretty sure that also did something because I would constantly unflatten it and revert it back to a fro. So, I've decided to do the big chop again. But I have a question: how do I protect my hair at night? I thought the durag would serve its purpose but it actually fucked my shit up. Then what is a good hair routine? I used to put castor oil in it every night and such.

TL;DR - I messed my hair up by straightening it and thinking I was too good for split ends. Durag also messed up my hair. I'm getting a big chop again and what's a good hair routine. Also, what do I wear at night?"
subeam,7tpww5,"Maybe the durag wasn't the problem? I have a satin bonnet myself and experience the whole flat hair problem, but to combat that I spray my hair with water, then argan oil, then gently fluff it back into it's more curly state. Maybe the way you were unflattening/reverting your hair was causing some damage?

Robinspeakeasy,7tphqa,Was her hair bone dry or moisturized dry? That would make a difference to me.
jenplaysgames,7tphqa,"I mean 90% dry yes, and I’ve stretched my hair in twists over night and used a blow dryer on the cool setting to further stretch that. But if my hair is still in it’s naturally curly state? And dry? Issa no for me dog."
ladyAnder,7tphqa,"What was the purpose in her blow drying her already dry hair? What was she trying to achieve? Answering that, then maybe I can provide you an answer because I need more context. "
subeam,7tphqa,"Blowdrying dry hair?&&&I was watching a youtube video and the girl was blowdrying her hair. However, her hair was already dry. She claimed that blowdrying dry hair uses less heat and is therefore less damaging, but I'm a little skeptical. What do y'all think? &&&She moisturized it the night before but it looks like she waited until her hair was dry to blowdry. I guess it might be fine since she used Shea moisture in her hair the night before??&&&Oh ok. Hers was not curly, she used the method you're talking about. I just have never heard of blowdrying such a long time after coming out of the shower so I was not sure what to think. "
-yyyy-,7toqqg,"Protective styles for weak edges&&&I'm a mix of 4b and 4c. I have super thick hair but my edges are quite weak from braids. I'm looking for easy and long lasting protective styles that are either cheap or have a well justified cost.

Options:

I can do twist/braid outs with my own hair, but as busy as I am, I don't think I have time to dedicate my entire Sunday to that. 

I was kinda thinking of getting a sew in - I know a girl who doesn't cornrow tightly at all and she does full sew ins. I want to know some pros and cons before hand, as I've never had one before.

Getting my hair pressed is also another option. I know another girl who does presses really well and I've gone to her from time to time (not back to back or anything like that). No heat damage really, as long as I stay with my oiling and washing regimens. However, it's starting to get rainy where I am and it would be just my luck to get it pressed on a Sunday and be a bush on Tuesday. 

Thoughts?"
BoxedBoobs,7toqqg,"If your hair is broken off around your edges I think the very last thing you want to do get another style that will cause tension, such as a sew-in. I've seen lots of naturals rave about low manipulation styles + castor oil on your edges for regrowth. 

I don't have any good advice because I have some breakage too, but please don't let someone else braid your hair mega tight and cause more undue stress. I wear mainly twist-outs, tuck and pin, or a loose halo braid because it's low maintenance for me and it seems to help. Good luck! "

carelesswhisperr,7sj0w9,"Try [elasta qp moisturizer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036BWIBO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_eZ.zAbG7MBKB3) . 
I have the same texture and it works great! My hair feels light and soft.  
Water based, and creamy (but not super thick). "
lolokiguess,7sj0w9,"any suggestions for a daily moisturizer?&&&can i get a suggestion for something alot more water/water based, and another for a somewhat creamy (but not too thick/creamy) consistency for low porosity and 4c hair? sorry if this was asked here before. (nothing shea moisture or carols daughter please also?)"
saxxysundevil,7sj0w9,I use the True line from Made by Beautiful.
wildhuntressophelia,7sj0w9,The Oyin Handmade Hair dew is creamy but not too thick and super moisturizing. It's a bit pricy but you could try out the snack bar.
Atlantislove,7shb2s,"Hey there. I've been natural for 5 years. You may want to stop detangling your hair in between washes, use shampoo and conditioners from the same brand, get your moisture levels up for starters. I recommend finding someone on youtube with the same hair type as yours, and watching all of their videos to see how they care for their hair. "
BlackGirlTopaz,7shb2s,"Natural Hair Help!&&&this is my first post ever on Reddit, anyways I have been natural for 4 years now and my hair has not grown past my shoulders at all, its making me increasingly frustrated. Below is a little about myself

* **Basics**
* Im 18
* hair type i think is 4A
* low porsity
* I wear my hair in bun almost everyday
* **Routine**
* I detangle with condtioner or co-wash (usually conditoner) twice a week
* I deep condtion along with detangle and shampoo once a week
* I finger de-tangle
* I scalp massage
* **Current Products**
*( no oil or cowash currently)
* Condtioner ~ The Mane Choice hair mask

* **Weird Things happening to my hair**
* Normal people are only suppose to lose 100 hairs a day, I lose 5-6 times that amount yet see little difference in 
   the thickness of my hair
* I have slight bald spots on my hair line, there is hair, its just very short.

So far I have edited this post a ton of times lol below are a few things I might try new to help my hair out that I haven't done before.

* Wear my hair out all day everyday for the next 2 months (besides bed time).
* shampoo only once a month
* deep condition twice a week
* use deep conditioner to detangle
* start using oil sparingly
* use shampoo sparingly"
lottikey,7shb2s,Do you dilute the apple cider vinegar before you use it? Same thing with the black tea?
sol_la_soul,7shb2s,"Look into black tea rinses. I swear this helped me retain length when I was your age by decreasing shedding and strengthening my hair. I stopped using shampoo and did only cowashes,  deep conditions and weekly tea rinses for a whole summer. I swear by October my hair was 4 inches longer and kept growing after that. Apple cider vinegar can help you detangle with ease. Look into lavender and Rosemary oil for your edges. I mix mine with olive oil and oil my scalp daily. You probably don't need to wash, wet or manipulate your hair so often. I use shampoo probably once every 3 months if that. My hair is clean from cowashing and apple cider alone. Make sure you're not using too much tension while styling your hair, especially if you style it while wet. That will destroy your edges. Invest in a satin pillow case. Pretty cheap on Amazon. It won't dry out your hair or snag it so much. Wearing your hair out often is cool depending on your texture. My hair gets hella tangled, meaning I have to detangle if way more often, exposing it to abuse and hair loss so I'm better off keeping it up. Just be nice to your edges!"
unwaveringwish,7shb2s,"try limiting your washing to 1-2 times a week, maybe even 1. If your hair is always in a bun, it shouldn't need to be detangled that often. Hairline breakage can be caused if you bun all the time, try a few different styles to give it a break!"
Haekin_,7s7htm,"I recently started the L.O.C method, and my hair couldn't be happier!&&&First time poster, long time lurker. And yes, I know I'm late to the game but better late than never! 

I started the process 4 days ago, and if my hair could talk, it'd constantly thank me. I'm not sure *why* it took me so long to actually do it, but I'm happy I did. My hair feels soft, hydrated, and fluffy. 

That's all, just wanted to share that little tid-bit of good news! Have a good Monday! &&&L- Water and *""Coconut Whipped Créme Leave in Conditioner""* by *Renpure Professional*.
