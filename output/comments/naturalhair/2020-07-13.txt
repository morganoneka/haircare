aquariously,hu9ck9,"End of the day shrinkage! I used a water-based leave-in and some sheabutter. It started as a twist-out but at the end of the week it turned into this 😍. Thinking of making flax seed gel/aloe vera gel 🤗, any recommendations, recipes or tips?&&&&&&Thank you!&&&Omg! You are a gem ✨ totally forgot she made this video! I will definitely use it as inspiration when I make it 😁😁 will keep you posted ❤️❤️"

nasty_gal,hu9ck9,"Naptural85 on YouTube! Similar hair type and her tutorials/instructions to care for natural hair has significantly helped my progress in my natural hair journey. I don't follow some of her recipes and hairstyles exactly, but it's a good starting point on learning how to care for your hair as it gets longer and takes more time to manage.

Oh! Almost forgot. [Here's](https://youtu.be/faUKHCRlnHY) her flax seed gel recipe lol.

Let me know how the gel works if you make it! I'm curious about it, but don't really care for hair gel.&&&Naptural85 on YouTube!

radiolunch1,hu7ywj,Have a weird hairline and I used to be ashamed and cut my hair into fades and Caesars. Now I've grown it out into afro/braids and really like it. Pic is about 1 year of growth (taken a few months ago)&&&
thatguy2130,hu7ywj,Legit bro 💯
-PinkPower-,hu6uen,I had a friend that had some and he said it was really heavy. He would get headaches from the weight.

Quezie_F_Baby,hu6uen,"11 years growing my locs. 2 years growing the beard.&&&&&&I think I’ve reached a point where I’m comfortable length-wise with my hair. Now I’m moreso concerned with keeping it healthy.&&&I personally see no problem, if it’s for length."

unwaveringwish,hu6uen,the struggle is real
xxxshoshoxxx,hu6uen,"Question with locs, is it okay if I use braiding hair than my natural hair? I want to attain such length"
Healthyhair12,hu63lo,How do you maintain your twist outs?
SugarsDimples,hu63lo,"A little kinky, a little coily. Perfectly imperfect texture.✨....A week old TwistOut doing it’s own thing.😌&&&&&&Thank you!🥰
Hmmm, moisture is key. Do you keep your hair hydrated? Does your hair absorb moisture quickly?
Dryness is the main factor of breakage. Using too many products with alcohol can do more harm than could because alcohol strips your hairs natural moisture and likely the moisture you’re trying to put in.&&&Hi! Sorry for the delay. I pineapple at night &  I rehydrate as necessary by spraying a mixture of water, aloe Vera gel & a tiny bit of leave in conditioner."
keepingholdtillmay,hu63lo,I’m in a similar position as this
oreo9991,hu63lo,"Omg your hair is beautiful and looks so healthy. I’m currently struggling with my hair, it breaks off so easy and I can’t retain length. And tips? Products?"
papixsteph,hu61sp,All about female empowerment and how to deal with natural hair&&&[removed]
who_angel,htua8f,"is anyone kinda annoyed by all the ""gatekeeping"" complaints on r/ curlyhair?&&&i like the subreddit but it seems to be all 2a-3a hair and they all have complaints around ""gatekeeping"", which seems to be when someone says things like 'wavy hair isn't curly' or 'if your hair isn't curly when it's wet, it's not curly' or things of that nature on tiktok or ig. i get that hair can be a big part of identity, but it bothers me for 2 main reasons. one, these people don't often have to deal with the disrespect or weird fascination that 3b-4c people have to deal with, and a big one is that i'm lgbt+ and gatekeeping is a very serious thing in my community that can literally kill us. it's so odd to me scrolling through this and it seeing go from 'the doctor says i can't transition because i'm a lesbian and too butch to be a trans woman' and 'i can't go to the regular battered women's shelter because i'm queer and i can't use the lgbt+ domestic violence resources because i'm ace or bi woman in a relationship with a man' and then seeing 'gatekeeper on tiktok says i'm not wavy :/' immediately after. like i'm not even saying that they're in the wrong or that they should stop complaining, just that they use terms and phrases that make it sound like it's a serious social issue when it's just a few comments in a certain bubble that's easily avoidable. idk, i don't want to have that horrible 'if your problems aren't as bad as mine then yours don't matter and you should stfu' mentality and maybe that is what i'm doing. anyway if anyone has thoughts on this then pls share, i'd post this on the actual subreddit but i'd probably just either get banned or downvoted and ignored. thx for reading my word vomit <3"
chocokitten100,httzzv,I don't wash my treatments out. Seems pointless for me personally.
dreams_do_come_true,httzzv,"Questions about hot oil treatments?&&&Do you do a hot oil treatment before or after washing your hair? Does it matter?

And does it matter how much time you leave it in your hair? Is 30 minutes good or is it better to leave it overnight?"
ismololo,httzzv,I do hot oil before washing. I leave it in for about 20min.
who_angel,httzzv,you should do it before you wash because it'll be impossible to get all the oil out with just rinsing
Nachychika,htqynt,"Gather round curly and coily girls!&&&&&&I just got these from Evolvh, a company that makes some of the most amazing hair products I’ve ever used. This kit is currently on sale, and try their shampoo, come back and tell me how much you loved it

Kja1991,htpz89,"Why can't I do anything with my natural hair?&&&I'm beyond frustrated with my hair! I've been natural for about 5 years now and I thought this journey would be easier. Now matter what I do, I can't style my hair which is super embarrassing being in my 20s. I can't braid, I can't flat twist, I can't do twist outs, nothing! I've been watching YouTube tutorials for years and nothing! I get my hair done at a salon about every 2 weeks (I get my hair pressed) and why be natural if I'm gonna press my hair? 

I had a twist out done at a salon 4 days ago and I couldn't maintain it. I tried to retwist it but it looked terrible. Today I washed my hair with the intention of doing a wash and go. I watched so many videos and my hair looks nothing like what I saw. I think I have 4c hair but it doesn't curl at all. I washed and detangled it, sectioned my hair, applied Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie and put gel in.Here's the result:

What am I doing wrong?! I'm so tired of my hair and spending money to get it done 😔&&&Thank you for the reply! I did wet my hair while I was doing my hair and nothing."
OvertureStealer,htpz89,"When you did your wash and go did you spray the hair with water again before adding product? I have 4c hair too, I don't know what your porosity is but I did my first wash and go today and by the time my hair was detangled and sectioned I had to spray each section with water to get the best results, and rake for maybe 1-2 minutes each section. I think adding more water than you think you need will help your styles come out more defined. Oh and also leave in conditioner is super helpful for me! I wet my hair a bit, add leave in, wet it a little more, and then use a generous amount of gel/curl custard."
AHGASE7COX,htpfax,It’s honestly disrespectful
Asleep_Captain_8377,htpfax,so awesome and healthy!
Nachychika,htpfax,Shrinkage is real on 4C hair&&&&&&I love it coz it allows me to wear a different hairstyle
Primary_Aardvark,htpfax,It still amazes me
RabbitWednesday,htpfax,Means you've got that super healthy 4c hair. Great job taking care of it.
UrDadsFave,htpfax,It's undefeated.
