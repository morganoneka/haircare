9shycat,t32j68,"A lot of good info here, just want to second trying twists after getting a trim. I had similar issues and during the start of the pandemic I started twisting my hair. 
I experienced a lot lessss breakage &  experienced a hair growth spurt after months of no retention. 

Just make you’re moisturizing as you twist, you want super moisturized twist so that they last a bit. Moisturized hair + limited manipulation = less breakage + growth🎉"
ACoolGemini,t32j68,"Hi hi don’t know if anyone mentioned this yet but fairy knots can really only be prevented if your hair is stretched or in a protective style like twists, etc. 

I know for me I don’t get them anymore that much because I do detailed wash and gos and won’t curl on itself. Of course my hair shrinks as time goes by so fairy bits become more and more likely SONI have to refresh my hair again. 

As for Crown breakage that could be due to a number of things but general tips: my more gentle to that area if you notice breakage, try to reduce stress, and look into protein Treatments if you aren’t already."
In_This_To_Win_This,t32j68,"Breakage can come from over-manipulating and lack of moisture. Getting regular trims can help with the knots but also try gentle, slow finger-detangling before you comb or brush your hair. (Never detangle without some moisture/oil/leave-in conditioner added to the hair to help with slippage.) Be gentle with your hair. Try to get single or double twists put in and leave your hair alone for the week. (I will wear a scarf or bonnet in the house to stop myself from messing with my hair.) Sleep with a  durag, bonnet, and/or silk pillow case. Don’t wash it everyday. For oils, try black castor oil, argan, neem, or even olive oil. You can use a combination of all or initially try one at a time to see how your hair responds. Personally my hair hates olive oil but loves argan (which is even thicker). Use quality oils not cheap stuff cut with minerals oils and the like. Good luck 🍀"
Intelligent-Two-3188,t32j68,Looks like you need more moisture and maybe lil twist
KingMarvBoy,t32j68,Let your hair air dry after showering!
Nosey-and-curious,t32j68,"Trims, shampoo, conditioner and gel (botanical) if you want some definition that’s all you’d need I think. Every 5-10 days refresh it. Oils/butters can dry your hair out in the long run by preventing water molecules from getting to your hair. Clarifying shampoos are good to remove those barrier but you wouldn’t want to do that often."

SydiemL,t32j68,I think you just need a good routine!
cxmareau,t32j68,Why not just detangle if you have fairy knots?
gtfopx,t32j68,I absolutely hate fairy knots it made me do a big chop. Now I keep my hair trimmed and detangle throughly. I like to keep my hair in protective styled more than just keeping it out and letting it get tangled.
lildrewdownthestreet,t32j68,"Hi! I just wanted to comment on the OCD part as I used todo this with my hair and I used to pick my skin (diffrent but kinda the same)! With me, I tried to find things that would make me forget to do it like wear a scarf or get a stress ball whenever I had anxiety so I wouldn’t resort to this ocd tick or something else so I’d honestly recommend therapy if you can…. It really helped me as I no longer do it but yeah also you’re very beautiful lol i love the freckles (?)"

No-Juggernaut-6903,t2vf6t,"Need tips&&&I need tips on my low porosity hair and some questions i had. my hair is short rn and i want to grow it out. i deep condition weekly and i will start using the LCO method every few days.  i wash weekly

1. what should my day to day routine look like

2. how should i take care of my hair before i go out, like what should i do to
my hair. 

3. are there days i just do nothing to my hair?&&&i’m 4c african american. i wanna grow my hair out so i can do twists and things like that. i have low porosity hair"
aningnik,t2vf6t,I have 4c low porosity hair and I usually moisturize it using the LOC method. My daily routine is just making sure it isn’t dry most of the time I leave it in twists and take them down whenever I go out. The key to low porosity hair is using light products that are heavily water based bc we’re prone to build up so no heavy oils/butters. Washing your hair should be done only 2-3 times a month depending on how much build up you get. Also using warm water and warm heat to open up your follicles will help the product penetrate your hair instead of sit on top of it. I hope this helps you!&&&Also wanted to clear up you can use oils and butters just find ones that aren’t too heavy lol
anon23499,t2vf6t,"we don’t really know much about your hair or the styles/looks you’re going for so it’s hard to say!

I’m not sure how much this will help, but I’m 3c/4a, low porosity. I do wash and go’s weekly and in between washes I don’t really do anything to my hair. I use the pineapple method to sleep (satin pillowcase) and when I wake up I just let my hair down and maybe spritz some water on it if needed. Most days I do nothing to it. 

Sometimes mid-week if my hair is dry or frizzy, I wet it in the shower and condition it, then style it afterwards."
ACoolGemini,t2s755,"I absolutely love your hair and different colors btw but I’d say 1) you need more protein treatments when coloring your hair so if you were missing those your hair is much more susceptible to breakage 2) you have to trim your ends at least 3 times a year and lighting your hair usually makes that go up if you aren’t gentle with your ends (they are the oldest part of your hair so they have been through it) and 3) some people just aren’t the best candidates for bleaching or coloring hair so that might be something you just have to see for yourself or get a second option from a cosmetologist. 

Hope this helps"
EmmysEarth,t2s755,"Your hair is glorious. Leave it in peace. Keep loving on it and caring for it. If you’re bored, there are lots of human hair wigs in your texture that you can dye and have a time with"
LoveInPeace21,t2s755,"Is the dark you have now permanent? If so, you’d have to bleach it again. Not worth it. If it’s semi, you can try color oops, then wait for the rest to fade out back to light. It might not get as light as you want, but would look better than trying to force it back. I would not bleach or color lighter over the black either way. It wont come out as you want and will cause more damage."
jaykeren,t2s755,I want to lighten and dye my hair again but last time when I did it my ends became straggly and I decided to cut it and go back to my natural hair color. Now I’m bored with it and wanna switch it up.The last three pics are my most recent pictures. Should I just leave it alone?&&&&&&Yeah I as thinking about doing a rinse or something but I know I’d probably want a more dramatic change. I just want to do it safely.&&&The darker hair is my natural hair color. I don’t want to bleach it again so I’m thinking I might just leave it alone for now.&&&Thank you ❤️ yeah I think I will just experiment with wigs or color wax if I want a quick but not permanent change&&&Thank you for all your helpful advice! If I do change my hair I’ll take all this information into consideration 🙏🏽
jojo571,t2s755,"Try Hair Makeup gel by curlsmith.  I have 50% grey hair and have used the blond, the copper, and the pink.  All cover really well, are a good defining gel and are 100% temporary.

Two downsides, it's expensive- about 20 bucks per tube, and it transfers a little so you have to wear a scarf at night and there may be some flaking on clothing."
ontariodwarf,t2s755,"If you’re interested in keeping the dark color, you could try semi-permanent dye! I usually dye I’ve over my naturally dark brown hair (no pre-lightening) with red and purple dyes and it gives it a different tone but it’s never too dramatic and doesn’t last super long but is a good cure for boredom (for me). I’ve seen brunettes use the Kristin Ess glosses too and it’s a bit more noticeable with less damage than hair dye but I’ve never tried the product myself"
puzzlt,t2s755,"What about those temporary dyes that wash out. Are any of those that are more gentle on the hair? I would suggest that if so. Also, you could change up the color each time you wash...added bonus."

allthediagnoses,t2qf4a,"Definitely locs. I think that men with softer, more feminine features look better with shaved heads because of the contrast. Similarly, men with stronger, more masculine features look better with longer hair (like locs) because of the contrast."
heyfromthebay797,t2qf4a,I think going lower on the top with a fade and a crisp lineup would look good. It would draw even more attention to your facial features which are amazing!
jopa687,t2qf4a,"Genuinely want to know what hairstyle would best suit me. Thinking about getting dreads or just shaving my head really low…any opinions?

I just kept my hair really moisturized.&&&Thank you!!&&&Thank you!!&&&Thank you!!!&&&Thank you.  The reason why I'm saying my hair is type 4 is because I have not seen any 3b/3c people with hair like mine only 4a/4b. In the 1 year picture of my wash and go, I've started curl training by doing more 3 strand twist outs as well because I love that look on my hair. For my 3 strand twist out picture, one of the products I use has been working wonders for my hair and makes even makes the definition of my curls pop really good made my hair appear. The gel that I use doesn't flake and just makes my hair look juicy.

This 3 strand twist out I've done when I saw a few women doing on doing the Jerry curl activator challenge(?) And I wanted to try this myself. I saw another video on 3 strand twist and was amazed by the results and I wanted to try this with the curl activator and my favorite gel and that is what I ended up with and I never in a million years thought my hair would look like that."

Nosey-and-curious,t2eev8,"They teach easy and efficient care! You don’t need all those extra steps we’ve been taught!

Lalalulu147,t2ckfr,"I stopped back to back protective styles last July: I wear my hair out 1-2 months(perm rods , curlformers,  braid outs, turbans) and then braid it for 1 month ( faux locs , wig , crochet braids ,never box braids) and start all over. I'm OK with not retaining the max amount of growth : I want to enjoy my hair more.
If retaining every bits of that inch of growth is not imperative for you , consider wearing your hair out more and learning how to style it without extensions"
Raygerdanger,t2ckfr,"Try doing braids again, or Marley twists! Currently installing box braids because the growth that I had after my last set….whew I loved it! I suggest making sure you religiously oil your scalp with castor oil or Wild Growth oil in the white bottle ( it’s what I have been using a few times a week while my hair is in box braids) concentrate the oil on the part that’s really short, take some biotin/hair vitamins to help as well, drink tons of water! I realized that my own hair grows better when left alone and this may apply to you as well!"
Tealhope,t2ckfr,"Do you know the porosity of your hair?

Know how to carefully part your hair?

How many times does YOUR hair need to be moisturized a week?

Can you do braids /twist on your own?

Learning how to care for your hair is the number 1 way to see and retain length long term. Leave your hair out and learn how to care for it. Putting it away will retain growth but from my experience all that growth eventually breaks off. Get to know your hair 😊"

Ambitious_Ride_9700,t24bhu,Is it necessary to add heat when you’re deep conditioning?&&&I just started deep conditioning a few months ago and was just wondering if adding heat when I’m deep conditioning makes a difference.
Ephedrine20mg,t24bhu,I’m lazy so I just double shower cap and run my head under the shower water lol but heat does improve the conditioning in my experience
Franklyn_Gage,t24bhu,"Depends on your hair type. I have low porosity. If i dont use heat, it wont do anything for my hair"
Independent_Ad8963,t24bhu,"Heat is necessary if you want the deep condition to Penetrate deeper. If you don't want to deep under the blow/hair dryer, then there are caps like bonnets that are meant to insulate the heat when you wear it in your head. You can use that instead.  👍🏾"
Neisha_with_a_T,t24bhu,I have high porosity hair. My hair dresser told me I don't have to use heat. When I went by her last time she didn't use heat either I just sat therr for 10-25 minutes with it in my hair.

jclassic100,t24bhu,"Im high porosity, my cuticles are open no matter what but i will heat up my dc sometimes. Cant hurt 🤷🏽‍♀️"
ontariodwarf,t24bhu,"I don’t think it depends on porosity as much as it depends on the ingredients of the conditioner. Some ingredients will adsorb/absorb better with heat. This is especially true for oils. Other ingredients need either heat or time - they’ll work on the hair either way, but heat will speed up the process. Most ingredients, even in deep conditioners, work immediately so heat wouldn’t make a difference. Personally, I’ve noticed that when it’s really cold, my conditioner mostly sits on my hair (I apply deep conditioner out of the shower so I assume if I were in the steam/heat of the shower it would be a different story) so then I use heat  to get it to soak in"

Independent_Ad8963,t21cu3,"Oil, for the scalp. You can buy this from the beauty supply if he doesn't already have it. You'll need hair clips to keep the hair out if the way when you start braiding. Our hair can hold braids without adding anything to the ends but sometimes you may need a little extra help with using rubber bands at the ends of the braids if the braids keep unraveling. Always soak the rubber bands in oil. Why? Because our hair is naturally dry and if you do so it'll keep the hair from being dried out from the rubber band and it'll cause less friction. Make sure you comb his hair with a wide tooth comb or your fingers (NOT ON DRY HAIR) but moisturized or wet hair CAREFULLY from tip to root. You can temporarily braid / twist / clip each section you detangle just to keep the hair from tangling again or getting out if your way when you're detangling another section. Some people blow dry their hair b4 they braid but in your case this is optional and up to the guy you're seeing.

Once you finish braiding his hair, oil/grease his scalp to keep it from being dry and make sure he puts a durag or scarf on at night to maintain the style longer. For hair washing that's completely up to him. He can wash his hair whenever he feels it's time to do so. Other than that I believe that's it from what I know."
charizard627,t21cu3,"What are some tips for non-black people in terms of taking care of/braiding hair?&&&Sorry I posted this on another sub but was redirected here. 
I apologize if the question is weirdly worded but I have been seeing a black guy for a while (my first time) and this morning, before leaving his place, he asked me if I knew how to braid his hair. 
I am really good at braiding hair but I have only braided my own hair which is wavy but not curly or my friends that have straight hair so I have never braided hair like his. 
I did my best to imitate the braids he already had on but I didn't know what products to use or how to prevent the braid from undoing. 
I was wondering if there are any products to use or any tips that could help me style his hair better?"
