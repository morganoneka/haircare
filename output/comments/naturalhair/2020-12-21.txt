Dandie24,klhxkl,What was your hair growth regime?
Jameriaa1,klhxkl,"It’s been one heck of a journey but going natural was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!&&&&&&-protein treatment 1x a month (Aztec clay brand)
-deep condition 1x a week (texture ID)
-after deep condition, moisturize & seal , protective style (my go to are wigs or a wash n go). 
-trims as needed
-lastly, HAIRFINITY!! <—— this really did the trick. I was noticing growth every week.&&&Yes, I only took the pills. But I got the best results when I was consistent with taking them. It took them a while to start working when I first started taking them."
LexTae127,klhxkl,Omg you used Hairfinity pills too or all of their products? Your growth is amazing! Maybe I should’ve stayed consistent with my supplements
PuppiesDntPout,klhxkl,I loved Hairfinity when I was using it! It really does grow your hair. I stopped taking them because they made me burp a lot. I might start them back though.
Section101,klhxkl,That’s a lot of growth!

HealingQueen,kld9ht,"Agreed with the above. A lot of these terms are for companies to convince you to buy more of their product (""get the leave in, styler, and finishing spray for this style"") than it is about your hair's needs."
bassperson98,kld9ht,"Using a styler cream as a moisturizer?&&&Hey y’all. So I’m a guy that just started growing his hair out since the start of March. I decided to do a twist out and used my sister’s product: kurlee belle’s Curl defining cream Styler and daily moisturizer. It worked well on my hair and I wanted to know is it possible to use this as my main moisturizer? I remember seeing some videos where people recommended not using a styler as a moisturizer but this product says it’s a styler and moisturizer. So what do you all recommend? Thanks

Btw, I have low porosity hair and 3 inches of hair length"
invalidchoices,klcrvn,Wash N Go featuring leave in conditioner&&&
IIIThreat,klcgb9,"I have the same density-hair strand balance you do. Have you tried the LOC, LCO, or PMP methods of moisture retention?"
ricochetblue,klcgb9,I think I have a similar hair type to yours. Henna helped make my strands thicker.
scifiemo,klcgb9,"need advice: thick density but baby fine&&&hi! so i've had difficulty with my hair all my life and had mostly just given up on it, keeping my hair shaved short for about 9 years until november of last year. i love the way i look with more length and i really don't want to start cutting it again but i'm at my wit's end. 

my hair is low porosity and 4b/4c in texture. the biggest problem is that while my hair density is thick, my strand thickness is BABY fine, like near invisible lol. detangling is impossible because the strands twist around each other so easily, and my curls rarely clump together. any sort of manipulation seems to cause it to break, even just fluffing it once i wake up.

feels like i've tried every trick in the book to help make things more manageable/stop the breakage/define the curls but nothing has helped. i just can't seem to make sense of this. maybe there's just something i'm completely overlooking? any insight or tips are much appreciated! i can take pics if needed. thanks!!&&&hi! yes, i actually really like the LCO method. i use water in a mist bottle (or sometimes oyin juice and berries), a curl custard, sealed with a mix of coconut and castor oils. leaves my hair soft and moisturized but still somehow tangled, frizzy, and falling out with even the lightest touch. 

may i ask what your regimen is? thanks!"
LaPrietaLinda,klb8sh,"Defining Wash n'go "" La Prieta Linda"" technique&&&1. Cowash hair 
- The co wash in my personal opinion for my hair it allowed me to retain my shirt and not fully strip my strands of any natural oils that I have which is very little given my dry skin and coarser texture of hair, which makes it harder natural hair oils to travel to end of your strands. I produce very little natural sebum. 
2. Deep condition hair
- apply oil blend at scalp
-cover twists with Plastic Cap to keep natural body heat in closed area creating natural humid environment for cuticles to open up and drink the nutrients from your hair oil
- When sectioning hair off for twists it is important for my multitextured hair to be sectioned off by curl pattern, as my looser curly like more mousse and less custard applied to it as the cast around my crown doesn't break as easily as the parts of my hair I lay on my nape and perimeter sections of hair. 
3. Rinse deep conditioned hair while in twists. Rinse throughly 
4. Lightly pat and scrunch hair with cotton t shirt to avoid frizz and breakage from towel drying hair. 
5. Clip up sections. Then take down one twist section and apply mixture of leave in conditioner (my choice is ""Jamaican Black Castor oil Leave-in Conditioner"" from Shea Moisture® ) blended with olive oil in an applicator bottle. 
6. Twist section back up after the hair soaks up the leave in conditioner. Continue this step all over the head. Split twist sections as needed and maintain sectioned off parts by difference in curl pattern. 
7. Once you've completed applying leave in conditioner in all twists. Again clip up twists and one by one unravel them and apply generous amount of (your choice of gel/styling custard) Beautiful Textures ® ""Curling Custard"". Use Alcohol-Free Mousse on an as needed basis to further define and allow your natural curl pattern to shine through after it being loosely manipulated by two strand twist. If you would like a moose with more hold I strongly recommend the ""BB Tropical Roots®  Moisturizing Sculpting Foam"" or  Design Essentials ® Almond & Avocado Curl Enhancing Mousse. Play around with your product amounts for both the baby tropical Roots product and the design Essentials product they are both strong on hold so I would use less custard and dilute the leave-in conditioner of choice a bit more. 

With this particular technique I do use the prayer hands method to smooth in the products on my hair and make sure that my curls are retaining moisture and the products are locked into the hair strands. I would simply unravel my twist then take one section of that unravel twist and from route to ends with Custard in my palms I would slide my palms down the length of my hair and allow my hair to part in section by itself and assist with my fingers further separating my curls. This method in particular never failed me I had been using it for a year to two before locking my hair and unfortunately I do not have a video detailing or showing an audience how I went about this method.

This particular method allowed me to define My curls at a max amount which I was never able to accomplish throughout my life. My hair does not naturally clump very well and I found this method more helpful for my hair type than the shingling method which I used for several years and the prayer hands method combined.

If this particular method has helped you or you have extra time on your hands to try out something new please let me know in the comments below how this method has worked for you. If you have any questions on this particular method or any techniques that I applied while styling my wash and go for multi-textured hair, please let me know.

You that you please share this technique and if you can I would very much appreciate it if you were to credit me and call it the ""La Prieta Linda technique"", my pseudonym."

Desaturating_Mario,klagvd,"I’ve thought about seeing what no product does for me, but I don’t want to be on day 5 on the first day"
HealingTank,klagvd,"If I do a twist out without any products in my hair, it comes out more voluminous, soft looking, and fluffy.

When I don't, it ain't nothing but frizz."
LaPrietaLinda,klagvd,"What does your no product hair look like compared to your defined wash n' go ?&&&&&&It was stressed me out as well my hair was tangled up so bad that I had to take 1-2 hours the detangling it with care. I was just really stressed out and absolutely done with my natural hair at that point in my journey. I now have my hair locked and at the end of my locks I have my curls out.&&&Can you rephrase this satement for me? I'm having trouble understanding it.&&&Thank you. My hair is currently locked and I still use the same oil blend that helped me fill in strands that I accidentally pulled out.

My oil blend is 4-5 drops of Peppermint essential oil, Rosemary essential oil, Extra Virgin or Light Olive oil, Sweet Almond oil, Avocado oil, Jamaican Black Castor oil (seals in moisture). Now the amount of my essential Oil drops is dependent on the size of the container I'm using to hold my oil blend in. I strongly recommend using a brown glass bottle as this will allow your blend to last longer instead of go rancid faster than it would in a plastic bottle."

TulipsandDandelions,kl83vt,"My hair is very low porosity-like water will sit on top of it-so here are some tips I've found work for me (in no particular order). Sorry if this gets long/rambley.


1. Work in moisture during wash day!! 
-Take time to make sure your hair is saturated with water, like really sit under the water and work it into your hair. It can take longer than you think for water to really get into your hair strand. Just because it's dripping doesn't neccesarily mean it's saturated. 
-Use warm water to open your hair cuticle to product. Cold water is not your friend. It will seal up those cuticles so that product just sits *on top* of your hair when really you want to be working in those products.


2. Be cautious of co-wash(?) Maybe this applies to a lot of naturals, but I find that low-porosity hair is harder to get moisture into but also holds onto it longer. I know high-porisity hair can get dry and brittle (moisture escapes easier) so many people prefer ""moisturizing shampoos"". I like a good clarifying one even if it's a tiny bit stripping bc you can put that moisture back in and you can be confident that you got rid if any build up. Like I said, once that cuticle closes extra product can sit in your hair and lead to more build up, so you want to really cleanse your hair of all of it during wash day. (Our cuticle is already super tight, if there's any product left it would just be sealing it even more leading to dry hair. For me, co-wash can equal dryer hair)



3. LCO! Put water (liquid), leave in conditioner, and a cream all in your hair BEFORE letting any oil touch your strands. For me it's always a fight to keep my cuticle open to products. Don't seal your hair with oil before you've got all your moisture in. 



4. I've found that my low-porosity hair is more low maintenance. Once you get in that moisture on wash day, it'll hold onto it for a while. I rarely moisturize between wash days and I have waist length 4c hair. My hair never really gets brittle. Once product is inside, it's inside. My hair also holds styles well. (I think this is all bc of my low porisity).

This is long, sorry. Hope any of it helped!"
mizzlemybizzle,kl83vt,Need help navigating natural hair what type is it? How do I handle my hair having low porosity? Anything is helpful!&&&&&&Thank you so much this is all really helpful to know!
Groansindepression,kl7q6m,"Hi OP. I am so sorry you feel like that. I think at one stage or another people hate/dislike their natural hair, especially during the transition phase or during  the first few years. I am 4C, medium length as well and I hated my hair during the transition period, it didn’t help that friends and family would make comments about how ‘unkept’ It looked and all I wanted was 4A hair because it was the only hair type I was exposed to. It took some time but I learnt to love my hair and being positive towards it, whether it’s gassing myself up after I do a new hairstyle or looking at styles online for people with a similar texture. 

It is really about learning to love it and accept that it is a part of you like any other part of your body, learning about what products you hair needs and being kind to yourself through the whole process. Hair care is meant to be fun, it’s that time of the day/week when you get to focus on yourself and figuring out what your hair needs and what styles make you happy.  I hope this helps!!"
PigmentedLady,kl7q6m,"Firstly... 

There's nothing much some of us can say. As a naturalist who been natural all her life. 

Natural hair isn't about growth. And if thats what you're mostly concerned about, you might as well give up and save us time in explaining. 

Type 4 hair isn't hard. Even for those with the busiest schedules. What makes it hard is when we want ""curls"" and long length and thats something not all of our hair can do. 

EMBRACE the shrinkage, the coils, the texture, and the process. Your hair will thank you. 

I wish you could share a picture. Most women and girls who said they don't look like end up looking sexy as hell/cute (for my little ones) with it.

Its hard to look ugly in your natural state ."
SplitterToBe,kl7q6m,"I’m sorry you’re going through this, I can definitely see myself in you. I have always struggled with this and still do tbh. I’m 24 and from years 13 to 20 my mom, at my demand, would relax my hair (we moved to keratin when I was 16) and I felt the freshest right after leaving the salon and getting that « meghan markle hair look ». I still fantasize about straight hair but I’m learning to shift my pov mostly by intentionally following more curly haired people that look like me on social media, it does help in changing my standards of beauty. 
Also, the state of my hair reflects my mental health, so I try to make it a nice ritual to take care of it, it’s a weekly thing for me and I feel so much better when it’s done. The fact that I have to care for it makes me love it a lil bit more. I’m considering starting a hair TLC tracker in my bullet journal, that might help. And if my hair looks really good one day, I take a million selfies and look back on them when I feel ugly, and it keeps track of growth.

Having type 4 hair is truly life’s way to teach you patience lol, so try to learn from it, you might not love your hair everyday but the process of trying makes you grow. I wish you the best of luck! Hang in there."
kekethedropout,kl7q6m,"I hate my natural hair.&&&Okay so, I’ve been trying to avoid saying this but I truly hate my natural hair. Here’s the story:

I’m a 19F and I have 4C short/medium uneven hair that has heat damage. It’s a lot less heat damage than before because I cut off some of it, but I still don’t feel like it’s growing.Growing up I only saw my mom when I was younger, and when I did see her she would perm my hair and overall she did not know how to take care of it.

Then I moved in with my father and brother and my father would only know how to gel down ponytails or take me to the Dominicans to get my hair pressed.

Wearing natural curls became really popular when I was in high school, but I couldn’t do it because my hair didn’t have a “cute” or wearable pattern. I’ve tried flexi rods, twist outs, braid outs, Bantu knots, 3 strand twists, perm rods... anything you can name I’ve tried. None of them come out cute. I’ve even been to a natural salon and the perm rod set they did on me didn’t look good at all. 

Every product I try makes one section of my hair react differently than another part. I did a medium chop earlier this year in July, but it didn’t help. I still hate my hair.

I’m writing all this to ask has anyone else felt like this? If you have, how have you come over this feeling? And what has helped your hair? 

I’m desperate at this point because I really would love to wear my natural hair. It looks so beautiful on other people and mine isn’t. I’ll take any tips you all have! Thank you so much!

Edit: it says there are 6 comments on here but I only see 2? I responded to all the ones I see! Feel free to message me if you commented and i didn’t reply! :)&&&Thank you! I’m glad to know this isn’t an unknown feeling to other people. I struggle a lot with self care a lot because I have depression and my hate for my hair surely doesn’t help.  How did you figure out what works for your hair?&&&Thank you so much. I’m glad to know you overcame this! I just feel like so much of an outcast in the black community because I don’t have a good relationship with my hair.

I struggle with my mental health too.  To me my natural hair feels like such a chore and I hate it because I don’t think it ever comes out right. Do you have any tips on how to get over that feeling?"
Dandie24,kl7579,"I make flaxseed gel and put it on my hair everyday. I also make an Ayurvedic hair oil. It consists of: moringa, neem, bhringraj, Chebe, Rosemary, aloe Vera etc. I kid you not this really DOUBLED my hair growth rate."
HellloooNurse1,kl7579,"I was hospitalized for 3 months afted an accident and started losing my hair. (I am only 31). I found a woman's hair supplement called Viviscal (you can buy it in the drugstore or online). It stopped my hair from falling out within a couple weeks of taking it daily, but my hair is also healthier and grows quite a bit faster than it used to. Might be worth checking it out. It is a bit on the pricey side. But I found it worth it! I've been taking it for more than a year now. You have beautiful hair though!"
Primary_Aardvark,kl7579,No advice but I just wanna say you’re gorgeous (again I saw you on black lesbians lol)
almondmilkbrat,kl7579,I personally love Taking QUALITY multivitamins and using only hair products that are natural. I feel like those two things have helped my hair maintain its length. I feel like once u hit a plateau it’s not that ur hair isn’t growing anymore it’s really just the length just not being maintained. But since it’s ur hair I’m sure u would probably know what’s stopping ur growth more than I would.  Also just want to add that ur hair is gorgeous!
atomicoddball,kl7579,"Twist, twist, twists. (And any other stretching protective style)"
crisdee26,kl7579,My hair is way looser than yours. But I still think I can help. I literally left it alone the whole quarantine. Just wash and go. Minimal product. Just applied Marula oil for moisture. Washed it every two weeks. Left it in a bun most of the time and my hair grew so long. After struggling for years. Also no coloring.

shesmysummergirl,kl7579,Do you wear your hair down a lot? The ends of your hair can rub against your clothes and the friction causes breakage. Wearing buns or puffs can help during a length plateau. Gorgeous hair btw!
BlackThatsAll,kl67fr,You can stretch your hair overnight ! using twists or bands. T
Rainesstar,kl67fr,"I have pretty much your hair texture. When it’s damp, I do the banding method in 4 sections and it keeps the curl pattern a little looser, making the hair look longer and flatter. I don’t band too tight, just a normal hairband 3x around the section, use as many hairbands as you need down the length of the section to stretch it out. I leave spaces in between the hairbands in each section so my curl pattern doesn’t get weird."

LCG05,kksto8,"I agree with MissD. Definitely damp to wet hair for detangling. Some other tips are apply a leave in for detangling if not washing at that time. If you are preparing for a wash then use a prepoo. The African Pride Aloe Vera prepoo is awesome and adds a lot of moisture. Make sure to detangle or comb in sections, less hair loss that way. Also you may want to change from the metal afro pik to something with rounded tips."
MissD34,kksto8,"1. I try not to manipulate my hair unless it’s damp and I keep my hair stretched by putting it in two Bantu knots at night, which helps keep the tangles away. I shampoo weekly so that’s when I truly detangle. 

2. I start with my fingers and finish with a wide-toothed comb. 

3. Finger detangling is more “gentle” than combs and brushes in my opinion...and especially if you wear gloves so your nails aren’t snagging your hair. Keeping your hair in a stretched state also helps lessen the tangles and shedding during detangling. 

4. I use and swear by [this](https://www.princessdgifts.com/products/aloe-rose-detangling-spray)! I use it daily instead of a regular spray bottle of water as it has aloe Vera and Rose water in it which are great for moisture."
ShowDifficult208,kksto8,"Detangling 4c hair&&&My hair is armpit length. My goal is to grow my hair out as much as possible but idk if I'm doing things right. So I would like to see what other 4c naturals do
1. How often do you detangle? I do once every 2 weeks
2. What tool do you use to detangle? I use a metal afro pick. 
3. How do you prevent hair coming out? I feel like theres a lot of hair on the pick when I'm done detangling
4. What products do you use? I use a water based leave in and hair grease(dax, blue magic etc)"
Zaylyn5355,kkpziw,Wow! I was looking at the first pic line i don't see any damage but then i saw the second 😱. Maybe give it a few more washes... Are you sure they didn't give you a baby relaxer or something?
a-midnight-flight,kkpziw,"Thats one of my fears going to a salon. I have read so many horror stories of naturals going in just for a wash and their hair not being the same.&&&Heat damage happens regardless of what type of preparation you do. Some hair will damage fairly easier than others. But I think your hair is still fine. Just let it grow and get trims often. When I used to straighten my hair like 8 years ago and decided to go natural, that is the route I went. I had heat damage as well. During the transition, I used Cantu Leave in Conditioner Repair Cream. Like every week I made an effort to do deep conditions and sleep with it in my hair and cap. I still use that method once a week."
szakhia,kkpziw,"You might need a protein treatment, if you haven't tried that already.  Your hair might have hydral fatigue as well as just being weak after the press"
wildhuntressophelia,kkpziw,"Getting frustrated with my hair&&&&&&Thank you for the advice. Everyone is saying my hair still looks good but I don't feel the same because I know it could look better. It's also weird because the ends are curly and the root/middle of the shaft is all frizzy. 

If I'm not going to cut it I think I'll go with twist outs even though I have no idea how to maintain those throughout the week. Time to go back to the drawing board.&&&I've been natural for about three years. Last year I decided to go to the salon to get a silk press and my hair has not been the same since. I used to know everything about my hair before the silk press; exactly which products gave the best definition, moisture, hold etc. 

After washing out the silk press my hair didn't look damaged and didn't feel damaged. Then corona came and I went from weekly washing to protective styling but I never let my hair go dry. Even though I tried my best to maintain myhair (and did somewhat  because it's now really long) It does not behave the same. All my wash and gos are frizzy messes regardless of which products I use. I got a pro trim, did the max hydration method and dc everytime I wash my hair but I havent seen any major improvement. 

I was thinking maybe I need to re-moisture train my hair but I feel that will take so long and I was thinking to just chop and start over or should I just give up on my wash and go dreams.

Edit: in both photos I do the shingling method.

Any advice would be welcome.&&&It should have bounced back already, imo, since it has been a year since I got the silk press. 

I went to a stylist I trust, they usually do my trims. I saw everything he was using except what he sprayed before the flat iron. I hate when they face you away from the mirror. 

I'm thinking it might be time to get a new stylist based on this silk press thing and my experience last week."
wooweeitszea,kkpziw,"Unfortunately, heat damage is almost impossible to avoid even with good heat practices and some hair is more susceptible to it than others. I straightened my hair once in 2 years and it changed my hair permanently. I don’t think it’s worth chopping off but I don’t think you’re going to be able to revert the hair back. From everything I read, heat damage is permanent. I think you should continue to care for your hair as it and try to find new products/styles for the altered texture. I also regularly do protein treatments (1 every 2 months) in order to keep the strands strong. Your hair is still beautiful!"
