JordonJ23,8hgjtj,"I need serious help with my curls. Can y‚Äôall help please?&&&[Post to r/blackhair](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackHair/comments/8hgeld/i_need_a_lotta_help_wit_these_curls_can_yall_help/?st=JGV25YAQ&sh=81fdcc44)
So I recently made a post to r/blackhair that I linked ‚¨ÜÔ∏è. I can‚Äôt post the picture here so I linked that and I was hoping you guys could offer some help as to how to turn my mushroom looking afro into some well defined curls cus after two years of growin my hair, I put a lot of work into making it grow and trying many different things to also create curls on a day to day basis and not just when I get out the shower.&&&I embrace havin a lot of hair and being able to do twists and some braids wit it but the way it looks and is shaped is somethin I don‚Äôt like personally on myself."
curlyee,8hgjtj,just embrace your natural hair if nothing works out. you should be fine.
magicmusi8,8hgjtj,"You need something that‚Äôs a good humectant- but not too good, or it‚Äôll dry out your hairdo define your curls.  A moisturizer then a curl defining custard or pomade- or both in one."
_CoachMcGuirk,8hgik7,These are taken orally?
kelvinoralph,8hgik7,"FREE Fancy Oils for Hair Growth (No EmaiL Required)&&&[removed]&&&Haha Perhaps enter to give it away to friends. \(Just a thought\)&&&I believe the oils aren't taken orally. The supplements like the vitamins and biotins are taken orally.

I hope this helps. "
somehaizi,8hgik7,I'd enter this but I already have too many oils.

Post wash I use the **LOC** method to moisturize.

**Oil** - I use my own mixture I created with Peppermint Oil, Tea tree oil, Black Castor Oil, Almond Oil, Avocado Oil and Olive Oil. My hair really loves it. 

**Cream** - I wear my hair in twist outs, the cream I use for my twist outs is the [Cantu Conditioning Curl Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Cantu-Coconut-Curling-Cream-Ounce/dp/B01LTIAU6A/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1525490946&sr=1-4&keywords=cantu&th=1) 

I retwist my hair once a week (personal preference).. and I use a bit of [Cantu Shea Butter for Natural Hair Moisturizing Curl Activator Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Cantu-Butter-Natural-Moisturizing-Activator/dp/B01LTIAU7Y/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1525491585&sr=1-3&keywords=cantu), but sparingly, as it makes my hair feel slightly crunchy, I only use it in the front for my bangs to curl up very tight when I twist them. 

For edge control, I use the [Olive Oil Eco Styler gel](https://www.amazon.com/Eco-Styler-Olive-Oil-Styling/dp/B003E7UNE4/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1525491721&sr=1-1&keywords=olive%2Boil%2Beco%2Bstyler%2Bgel&th=1).. 

My hair is 4b/4c. Chopped two years ago -now past my shoulders, nearly 16 inches in length. I tried a LOT of products before I found those my hair likes. 

Also, I recommend checking out Amazon's [Texture's and Hues](https://www.amazon.com/amazon-textures-and-hues/b?ie=UTF8&node=17581171011) page. It's for women of color.. and it's AMAZING. "
LissyFishy,8guwll,4B?
SqueakyCog,8guwll,That chart came from a celebrity hair stylist. I wouldn't put too much stock into the chart either.
bishhhwahhh,8guwll,I was thinking 4a
intlob,8guwll,"The thing with hair typing is that everyone sees something different lol, but I'd say it looks like 4a that's just been roughed up a bit."
xosirenxo,8guwll,"Help! What curl pattern is this?&&&Here's the model: https://www.instagram.com/p/BiARsDHndnH/?taken-by=modernfro

I was wondering what curl pattern she was? I'm thinking about picking up clip-ins, but I want to make sure they can blend with my hair. "
FaeForTheCulture,8gu5q4,"I loveee the black/blue protein eco! I think the protein ones don't get the love they deserve! I've used all of them, but the gold. I think they're all great but my least favorite is the clear/white coconut one. Also, if I start getting buildup from using so much, the brown ones cake brown (duh lol) instead of white which is a plus for me too! I'm also low porosity/type4!"
HumbleAbbreviations,8gu5q4,Personally I am not a fan of this gel because it makes my hair too hard and you have to play around with leave ins or moisturizers because the gel doesn't always play well with other products.  I would suggest getting the small jars to see which ones would work for your hair.
JcSimba,8gu5q4,"Eco Styler on Low porosity 4c/4b hair&&&I wanted to try something to define my curls. Would eco styler be good? I do the LCO method and planned on using it after I put in oil 

There‚Äôs also more than one type of eco styler if it‚Äôs good I wanted to which is best for my hair type
&&&How often do you apply it?"
femmefinale,8gu5q4,I've used ecostyler for washngos and I don't love it. My hair ranges from 4a to 4c and the gel method makes my curls so stiff and creates a lot of build up and will flake after a few days.
lavasca,8gu5q4,I could never figure it out
Comeasyouare2,8gh3j1,"i bought it but i honestly dont know what its supposed to do, the one i bought was already premixed in a paste with ostrich oil and othe roil, it just gave me residues on my hair, may be i was supposed to wash it out, anyway, like every other thing in naturalhair care, its a fad. "
somehaizi,8gh3j1,Has anyone tried the chebe powder?&&&I want to try it but since it's expensive i'm not sure about spending money without any reviews. I've watched some youtube videos but they're usually first impression or youtubers known for giving glowing reviews for almost every product. 
dys_FUN_ction,8gfqkv,"Crochet braids pulling/ thinning out my edges&&&Hey guys

So I often keep my hair in protective styles, normally i do individual braids but I've fallen in love with crochet braids recently. They are faster to put in/take out and look nice. 

But lately I've noticed my crochet braids are pulling out my edges! I've tried to be careful ie. not wearing the hair in buns, not tugging, but I'm still getting sparser and sparser edges, and I can see TONS of white bulbs from where the follicle is being pulled out. It's not THE WORST now. But I don't want it to get bad, because it could. 

What should I do? Any advice? is there a braid pattern I can do to protect me edges? Should I just leave em out?? :O "
fitzella,8gfqkv,"I wore crochets braids for just over a year and managed to damage my edges üò© I tried leaving them out, but then I would straighten my leave out and then it broke off. Eventually my whole hair line broke off and was thinning out. I made the situation worse by trying to cover up the damage with wigs üôÑ Anyway now I just wear my hair out naturally. I wear it in a loose bun daily. My hairline and edges are slowly recovering with some TLC. If you‚Äôve noticed the damage starting, quit whilst you‚Äôre ahead lol. Maybe try wearing your natural hair out for a wee while to give your hair a break. "
HumbleAbbreviations,8g9ysm,IMO I feel like 400 degrees is too high.  Did your do a multipass with it?  Meanwhile just get a protein treatment to help stave off potential breakage.  
Moya1509,8g9ysm,"How do you typically wear your hair? If you want to keep rocking a puff, I'd cut of the straight bits. Or you can get braids for a few months, let your hair grow out a bit, and trim off the straight ends over time.

My heat damaged ends always end up breaking off anyways and causing split ends, so a trim is the way to go to maintain healthy hair. "
dolceradio,8g9ysm,"Heat Damage after Straightening Once a Month ONCE&&&Welp, it appears I have heat damage as it just washed my hair and it has straight strings about three inches long left at the bottom of the puff. Weirdly enough, I only straighten my hair *once a month* with CHI Iron Guard heat protectant and on 400 degrees (I have thick hair). I switched to a new flat iron the other day and I guess it singed me/I singed me. 

So...what can I do? Go natural for a while? Apply some oil-creme-butter? ...Cut it, though I only want that as a last resort?&&&Typically, I get a silk wrap and have my hair straightened, which lasts a month. I haven't been natural in quite a few years, so I'm not sure what to do with it. Braids may be an option...&&&I have really, really thick and long hair, anything less won't do it. Yes, unfortunately, with that new flat iron (have since got a new version of my old HSI) I did pass my hair about twice. I shouldn't have done it. "
