Niyahb196,p0ovqj,"I would cut it off and get a protective hairstyle that could last. Then once you take out your hair, you could determine whether you are comfortable evening out the lengths. If not, find a low manipulation protective style like slick back ponytail, puff, crochet,etc. You could even do an afro texture hairstyle with crochet hair now!"
Yung_Mulann365,p0ovqj,"I have a piece of heat damaged hair that I want to cut off but I don't know if I should do it&&&I have 4c hair but there is a piece of straight heat-damaged hair that won't revert back to being coily no matter how many protein treatments, rice water treatments, or hair masks I use. I think I either gotten heat damage from this hairstyle that I had from my birthday in February this year or it could be heat damage from like three years ago from my middle school graduation hairstyle, but ever since then, I have had this straight piece of hair that is visible even when I wash my hair or deep condition it, so my hair sometimes looks weird when I do afros sometimes. I want to cut it off but I'm afraid that if I do cut it off then my hair will look uneven and wonky. My natural 4c hair is growing out from under the heat damage from the root so you can see that the middle of it is straight and the roots are coiled up so that's good but I'm afraid that my hair might take years to grow out enough for me to cut off the damaged part of my hair. I want to cut it off so bad but I feel like I don't want to spend such a long time waiting for it to grow out. What should I do?"
Niyahb196,p0om3k,"I went back to good ol‚Äô hair grease as a moisturizer and sealant. It helps to prevent breakage and when applied to scalp, hair growth. But then again, do what works for you because it is your choice. Also Camille rose moisture milk after a condition treatment works really good"
RiceRedandBeans,p0om3k,"How to style hair between haircuts?&&&I'll be heading back to campus for school soon and won't have a car to get to my barber every other week. It's difficult for me to manage my hair after a month without a cut, and I have to finger comb and pat it down a lot to shape it. I often get single-strand knots after washing and detangling, and my hair is usually frizzy and feels brittle for a few days after a wash.

&#x200B;

I have 4C hair with a short-medium length drop fade and moisturize daily with a conditioner and oil, and wash it biweekly. I only pick my hair out a few times a week and on wash days to avoid breaking my hair. I make sure to use water and conditioner before picking it out and start at the ends, mainly using a downward motion.

&#x200B;

Are there any products or techniques that can help me style/shape it after moisturizing, or should I just pick it out more? I want to continue growing my hair out, so I avoid cutting more than like a 1/4 inch off the top when I get a haircut."
123ADHDandMe,p0nkch,this is great advice but one thing: air drying creates frizz n i reckon op wants to avoid/minimise that going by the nature of their post!
17281thTimesTheCharm,p0nkch,Thank you üò™
Internal-Ad-4972,p0nkch,"Hey! I have afrocentric hair but my family doesn't and I'm struggling to take care of it - can I get some advice!&&&Hey! Im daphne and im a very white very british lass from also white family who somehow landed here with afrocentric hair; thick, coarse and frizzy fitting neatly into the 3c category 

Im under 18 for context. My mum refuses to take me to a hairdressers for my kind of hair as they are ""scruffy"" (please interpret that as you will) and wont order this really lovely Jamaican hair product that really worked as it was ""smelly"" and uses more eurocentric hair products. My hairdresser is obsessed with giving me a center parting.

I have a rip through and brush that shit clean (thats how I got taught and only found out thats bad lmao) 

My hair is a lot and we are kinda stuck with it. I would really appreciate any tips on it? Its VERY thick and knotted and would love all product, styling and just general tips!

Thanks in advance"
gggggrrrrrrrrr,p0nkch,"I'm not sure how the UK compares to the US, but if possible, look for hairdressers trained in Ouidad or Devacurl techniques. They're trained to work with curly hair, so they give great haircuts, and their salons typically aren't ""scruffy/ethnic/urban/any other racist code words. ""

To learn more about caring for your hair, I'd suggest the Curly Like Me book. It's full of great techniques. Some basic instructions to follow:

* Don't shampoo more than once or twice a week. Many people skip shampoo and only wash their hair with conditioner. 
* Use a good leave in conditioner.
* Gently detangle hair with fingers or a wide tooth comb while wet.
* Allow to air dry.
* Never comb or brush hair once it's dry"
mooshu1x2,p0nkch,I think r/curlyhair would be a good place to ask this question.

AnneHeadless,p0ls8x,"Breakage duhhh, I mean like what do you sleep on ? Do you have a satin pillow case or bonnet or scarf?"
Bluecraft55,p0ls8x,"Transitioning to natural but don‚Äôt know why my hair at the bottom isn‚Äôt together with the rest of my hair?&&&&&&I have been doing buns each week so that is probably why. But I also don‚Äôt know what else to do since I do not know how to braid of flat twist my hair&&&Actually, the ring around my bonnet is not satin and lined up with the EXACT area that the breakage is in. So I think that is why I‚Äôm getting breakage. I ordered a satin pillowcase so I will switch to that for the next couple months snd see if that makes a difference&&&I sleep with a bonnet on every night&&&Yeah it‚Äôs much shorter at the bottom. In fact pretty much the back of my head is shorter üßê. I definitely think I need a protein treatment of some sorts"
CharacterMassive5719,p0ls8x,Is it shorter at the bottom?
Fine_Elevator_2167,p0ls8x,Is it rubbing up against your clothes? Are you pulling on them? You got to figure out why and stop it.
Longjumping-Ad-4874,p0ls8x,I found this video for breakage https://youtu.be/mt1XUlc2n88
RealTalkReactionTV,p0ls8x,Try using avocado and castor oil blend to minimize breakage.
TaiPer077,p0ls8x,"It‚Äôs breakage that could be due to a lot of reasons. The strands being too weak and breaking off, stress, your head rubbing on your pillow(use a satin/ silk pillow case or bonnet), etc. 

 When I was transitioning, I would do flexi rods to give myself the illusion of blended curls. It helped me from keep my hair in any types of tight braids, buns, and it looked pretty good. I used a gel and water. I‚Äôd stay away from oils. Oil and water do not mix and using oil clogs your hair follicles. Just focus on using water based foams/ gels/ shampoos/ conditioners. :) I transitioned for a good two years before I chopped and now my hair is healthier than it‚Äôs ever been once I cut out oils."
Zexy_Prophet,p0ls8x,"Breakage due to stress in those areas. Are you tying your hair too tightly? The weak/ relaxed ends will break off at the ' line of demarcation'. That is the point where your damaged relaxed hair stops and your thick natural hair begins. Its a fragile point. 

Protective styles and being extra kind and gentle with your hair will help. Many women do a big chop to avoid this."
kkinks__,p0ls8x,Mine did the exact same thing when I was transitioning! But once natural I noticed that its the fastest growing/thickest part of my hair.
moderatef,p0ls8x,Maybe breakage ?
myneighbortotohoe,p0ls8x,Look into biotin supplements
phdiva08,p0ls8x,"Please visit a trusted natural hair stylist that can give you good advice. It can be a number of things. Plus, a stylist will help you determine styles that work for your hair and your lifestyle. The best money I spent was learning how to perfect a wash n go and finding out the best products to use! Oils and butters are not the solution for all I hair issues. Proper cleansing, moisturizing (with water!), conditioning and styling are key!!"
rolloicecream,p0ls8x,The hair needs to be put away and given time to grow.

Khrene,p0ecbj,"No, unless you plan on having fake hair in your locs forever.

Just keep growing as a fro/natural until you have the money and hair length."

Routine (1-2 times per week):

1) Shampoo - Redken All Soft

2) Condition - Redken All Soft (detangle with a paddle brush in sections) 

3) First Gel - Uncle Funky‚Äôs Daughter Curly Magic, in the shower directly after rinsing out conditioner

4) Second Gel - Eco Styler Krystal (the clear one), just out of the shower, for extra hold

5) Dry - I sit under a hooded dryer (from Amazon) for about an hour.

Overnight, I use a satin-lined ‚ÄúAfrona‚Äù (from wovenroyal.com) to lift my hair upwards while sleeping, which provides gentle stretch as the days pass.&&&That‚Äôs such a flattering observation‚ÄîI really appreciate it! ü§óüôèüèΩüòá&&&Thank youü§ó&&&Thank youü§ó&&&Thanksüòä"
