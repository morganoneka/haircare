Infinite-Swordfish97,pn6f3m,"For some it means no relaxers or altering of any sort. I’ve heard people say dyed hair is no longer natural, for example. For me it just means no perms."
SwansonsMom,pn6f3m,"Natural hair typically refers to hair that hasn’t been chemically straightened (e.g., with a lye relaxer). Relaxers alter the structure of the hair strand, so you often can’t tell what your “natural” unprocessed hair structure is once you’ve been relaxing your hair. You’d have to grow out the relaxed hair before you have enough natural hair to determine your texture again."
carlacom,pn6f3m,What exactly does natural hair mean?&&&Hi friends I was wondering if anyone could explain what natural hair means? I have 3c/4a natural hair myself but realized I don’t really know what it means 😅 does it mean you hair is textured? Thanks in advance!
BZLite,pn68e9,Girl the humidity gon do it to us ☹️ it’s inevitable
MaukatoMakai,pn68e9,A good mousse (I like Moroccanoil’s curl one) and gel that isn’t too heavy. And not touching your hair - that was the hardest for me to learn. Leave it alone lol. Now for blowouts I’m not sure because it’s dry and at that point you’ve already done some of the frizzing yourself…?
Readyreadyreddit,pn68e9,HELP! Products to combat frizz!&&&&&&Any recommended products are appreciated! Also if you don’t mind explaining how you use the product when blowing out your hair and/or doing stretching methods! The FL humidity is kicking all my style’s butts! 😭😭😭
Yaz-meean,pn68e9,Talih wajid curl soufflé or design essential stretch cream
ococonut,pn68e9,Blended beauty
the_onri,pn68e9,"I’m just not sure that stretched/blown out styles are compatible with humid weather, especially when it’s windy as well. You may be better off wearing your stretched style in an updo while outdoors. Otherwise, it could be worth it to try some of the suggested products in other comments."
Dorkydori,pn2ga9,Does getting your hair straightened during the keratin treatment burn?&&&My mom got the keratin treatment and said that it burned so bad when they blow dried and flat ironed her hair. She even had some black stuff coming out of her hair while she combed it and she thinks it came from her scalp.
morgangraaace,pn2ga9,Her hair should not burn at all during any part of a keratin treatment. They could have been using to high of heat or going to close to the scalp while using the flat iron.
AmorLaluz,pn0so9,My cat is the same way. Every time I go to the bathroom here she comes unless she’s sleeping 🤣your hair is gorgeous!
Karlajimenez,pn0so9,"Girl, pretty hair check, bye"
MushroomGaurd,pn0so9,Your hair is gorgeous and your dog is cute! lol
differenttreez,pn0so9,Tried to get away from my dog in the bathroom..didn’t work&&&&&&Thank you! I just took my plaits down. I’m post another after I pick a style&&&Thanks hon…he follows me everywhere too&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you 😊
totib_iscrazy,pn0so9,Love both your hair and your dog
Fun_Detective3720,pmxc7g,"Oh we'll notice. I have curly hair too and I think my hair smells good after day 4 and my hubby tells me otherwise. You just are use to your funk so to you, you don't smell dirty but the rest of us can smell yo stank."
QueenMfirstofhername,pmxc7g,"My dirty little secret (SFW natural hair appreciation post)&&&fact #1: Today was washday🛀. And it was a good one. Did everything right, was gentle with my hair - little bit more shedding than usual but doesn't bother me too much. 

fact #2: today was also probably the last warm and beautiful day of summer 🌞 a perfect day for a quick run!  🏃‍♀️

Of course I only realized fact #2 after being done with fact #1. For a moment I was a little angry with myself for not planing ahead 🚫💭🤔

But then I realized - I have those amazing curls! 💡 Nobody will notice if I go for a run now AND not wash my hair for another 7-10 days 🌚

So I happily went for my quick run in the sun, hair still a little wet but who cares. 🤷‍♀️ My hair is neither greasy nor smelly now and nobody (except you 🤫) will know that I am a dirty girl, washing her hair before exercise  😈🤘

Here's to the curls!"
ndilapha,pmxc7g,"This is so lovely! 💞💐 I also had washday but I went for a not so quick 😬 run first. Washday was a breeze. My girl showed up ready to impress! 
Enjoy the rest of the week! 😊"
spacej0ck,pmvv3j,"I leave my twists in for a day maximum. I don’t use twists as an actual style because sometimes it leads to matting and tangling. 

For elongating twists, products don’t do that. Technique does. I hooded dry my twists. When I take them out, I apply gel (yes apply gel on dry, unraveled twists) and diffuse that section on cool while pulling it semi taught. 

This makes my curly hair almost as stretched as my hair blown out."
waitforthereal,pmvv3j,"2 questions about my hair&&&i currently twist my hair w sections about ~1sq inch but even then i find it starting to get matted after a couple days. would going any smaller make it loc up quicker? 

also i love the way they look when wet bc it's close to my length goal. is there any good products out there that ""reduce"" shrinkage?"
Marichurro,pmvqdy,Go to protective styles&&&I wanna do buns but ok thwy cause breakage. Any go to styles y’all recommend
girl-w-glasses,pmvqdy,My go to is knotless braids and passion twist
sierra-8767,pmvqdy,Knotless box  braids are lightweight and easy on the scalp. My new favourite .
spacej0ck,pmvqdy,Basic twist outs. I used to do my own knotless braids but after a week I miss my hair WAY too much.
throwaway1145667,pmuh1q,"Best box braid hair tutorial on natural hair for absolute beginner?&&&I am trying to learn how to do my own hair, since I don't want to pay more than 100$ for somebody to do my hair. I've just been wearing plaits my whole life, and I'm getting tired of them. I can't cornrow, so I decided to try box braids. Turns out I can't do those either, even crochet ones that are supposed to be easy! I don't know what else to do. Are there any videos you guys can recommend? I want to use them as a protective style, so I have been avoiding blowout my hair/apply heat (also because my natural 4b hair is shoulder length anyways when stretched)."
TexasProud311,pmmqt6,Those look awesome
VariousCelery7826,pmmqt6,Does anyone know how to get twists like these&&&
violaPAYvis,pmmqt6,These are rope twists I think. You have to twist each section to the right before you twist them over each other. Look up how to videos for rope or senegalese twist.
roseinmybud,pmir55,"No known cause for the breakage&&&Hey friends, curious if anyone has any thoughts. I have pretty fragile hair, meaning if I overdue a style, forget my bonnet or use edge control with alcohol, I’m seeing breakage. I usually can pinpoint the reason when I start to notice signs to breakage, but for some reason the bottom layer of my hair is breaking off and I have no idea why. For context, I have curly hair down to my lower ribs, but the bottom layer is barely past my shoulders. I wear my hair in twist/braids during the week and during the weekends will do a wash and go. I wrap my hair every night, don’t really do high right buns or consistent tight styles. I wash my hair and deep condition weekly. I have no idea what could be causing this breakage. I do think it could be product related because the bottom layer tends to be frizzy compared to the rest of my hair, but for the most part I really only have leave in in my hair. Any thoughts on the cause? Also, any products recommendations to prevent further breakage? My plan is to keep my hair in protective styles for a few months and then hopefully allow the hair to grow out so it blends better with the rest of my hair."
AzariaZahara,pmhy4t,"Natural hair styles&&&Hair is about 10 inches, been growing it for about 2 years almost three"
AbandonedSeige,pmhkag,How long are you leaving your hair in twist for? My hair is shorter than yours and I've noticed I've got to leave my twist in doe about a week for my twist out to really pop
Big-Swimming-7886,pmhkag,"Why do styles like twist out or wash n go never work for me? is my hair too short? When my hair is stretched it's about the length in the first picture. Without that, it's around the length of the second picture&&&&&&Usually over the weekend and sometimes overnight.&&&They don't give me good curls at all and I can't really style them or make them look nice because they just stick up when I try. 
Maybe the products might be the problem as well, I'll look into that.&&&To do these styles I used eco gel, miele leave in and shea moisture curl enhancer.&&&I used to do it with soaking wet hair, but lately I've been trying to do it with damp hair, and I'm not getting good results with either. And yes I do use a detangling brush.&&&Maybe you are right, I will try to go to a professional as well and see if that helps.&&&I haven't tried foams, maybe I should try some. Do you have any suggestions?&&&Thank you! I'll try that!&&&Thank you, but as a told someone else, this is not my hair, these are photos I found on the internet to display the length of my hair.&&&And maybe I should try different styles for now and let my hair grow out a little longer.&&&Thank you, I'll try that, but I'm not very good a flat twists as I never get a definite shape when doing them.&&&Do you recommend any?&&&Thank you, but that's not my hair, those are pictures that I found online that show the length of my hair.&&&Thank you for all the tips everyone! I will be trying them all and hopefully all goes well! If you have any other tips you want to share, please feel free to comment. Thanks again!"
Hanyo_Hetalia,pmhkag,"Ummmm.   


Your hair is amazing."
Kahlen-Rahl,pmhkag,"Had a similar problem when first doing twist outs, the final product always looked stupid,  but then I discovered flat twists and that was the game changer, since I was more are able to control where the final twist will be and they just seemed to lay better than individual twists"
Savageho3,pmhkag,Hair isn't too short. What products do you use?
babbibaby,pmhkag,"Do you use water and/or do your styles on soaking wet hair? That helps your hair take the shape of the twist and dry in place. Also are you using some sort of denman or detangling brush to define your curls while wet? You should be able to see your curl after brushing it out with product while its soaking wet. Then twist up. 

I found that if the section isn't wet and brushed out well enough, my hair has less definition and turns out frizier and poofier."
bellajojo,pmhkag,"Try kinky curly custard and 2 strand twist it, leave it for a minimum of 3 days, wear silk scarf to bed and take it out= bomb curls. 

Love your hair and the whole look"
ilikeweirdos41,pmhkag,Wow! Beautiful picture! 😍
impeeingmom,pmhkag,"I'm going to be 100% honest, It's not that you can't have those hairstyles but making them last is the problem when your hair is that short. When I was that length keeping the hairstyle overnight was a complete nightmare, they never looked good after day 3. Now that my hair is a lot longer it's so easy to just pineapple."
mzattitude,pmhkag,It’s the products your using
poochee_pansy,pmhkag,"When you say they don't work do you mean they never give you good curls or something else? Whatever it is I don't think length is the problem. You can do a lot with short hair.

Common things people struggle with when doing twist outs is they don't use product with enough hold or they don't let the twists dry completely before undoing them (and make sure you undo them gently starting at the ends). 

You might try using product with different consistencies and experimenting with bigger or smaller sections sizes depending on your density. I've never done a wash n go though so it's anyone's guess what could be the problem there.&&&Flat twist outs always give me beautiful curls, but the way there's a hump in my hair right by the roots when I take them down 😂"
starrgazin,pmhkag,"I think you hair looks wonderful!  Perhaps let your hair do what It wants?  It looks so healthy, lush and full. I love the color! And every style you posted looks fabulous! ❤️ looks like you’re doing an incredible job."
trinilena1,pmhkag,It's the products. Your hair might like gels or foams better than creams.
-NotForSale-,pmg5nv,"Be unapologetic.  For your styled hair and for your natural hair.  

I love natural hair,  untamed is beautiful.  Every shape size color section is beautiful!  Media has us confused on true beauty.  I go days with untamed hair.  

I tell you a short story.  I once shaved off all my dreads thinking these people would respect me more.  It didn’t change a damn thing.  I’ll never change for someone else ever again.  If I did it would be for me. 

Be so unapologetic for who you are.  It’s your DNA it’s your culture .  Own it, rock it and be proud. You are a star. 

I know sometimes we want to make things better.  Do that if you feel like you are.  But for the real you don’t have to change a damn thing. We love you for who you are.  The only person you can be. A god given gift.

Best of luck with all your endeavors."
Bearis4B,pmg5nv,"There's nothing wrong with loving a protective style. I LOVE having weaves. It frames my face really well which is why I love it!

But like you I also love my natural hair because it's fluffy, and frames my face well too when puffed!

So long as the love you have for both are equal, there shouldn't be an issue.

And heck yeah when people compliment my weaves, well- I paid $700 for it so you can be damn sure I'm gonna accept that compliment like it's my own hair lol!"
throwaway988183445,pmg5nv,"feeling guilt for loving protective styles&&&i used to always have my fro out, and was even very proud of it. but ever since getting passion twists, crochet, knotless braids etc etc ive noticed people being nicer to me, and i just felt a lot more put together, and prettier? it frames my face better. issue is, as much as i love the looks i know this isn’t good for my hair and it’s weighing on my self esteem. i feel like i’m lying. people compliment my hair and i feel guilty for saying “thank you”. i guess i lowkey wish my hair were naturally looser, longer, i don’t know. but i don’t know what the solution is. i don’t necessarily think my natural hair is ugly. just not my highest potential."

Aoki5,pmeiqg,"hair transition&&& The hair transition process is nothing more than the time you go without chemical procedures so that your hair grows in its natural form. People who are dissatisfied with chemically altered strands go through the transition and want to return to curly, frizzy or wavy hair."
AlexandraLiberty,pmdn3h,"No style recommendations unfortunately, but you are so cute and handsome. 💕"
ChumChums2400,pmdn3h,"My first attempt at doing a blow out kinda worked. I was able to get rid of many single strand knots and I'm giving Halle Berry Catwoman! 🤣 I knew my hair grew but didn't realise how much it did! Leaving short hair behind me rn! Any styles you can think of that might slay? 🤣🤣❤&&&&&&Thank you so much! ❤❤❤&&&It's ok and thank you! ❤&&&Thank you so much! I just wash my face day and night, occasionally a cleanser and toner and wear sunscreen and moisturiser. Sometimes wear peel facemask but I don't use them as much now!"
DemonNuggs,pmdn3h,You gotta drop your skincare-routine!
Mamaciitaa96,pmdn3h,I love how it looks now! Btw your skin is flawless 😍
kaqhi,pmdn3h,Off topic but please drop your skin routine cause damnn it's glowing!!!
AffectionateAnarchy,pmbt3f,This is great research. Im not this organized lol I dont even know what type mine is but it might be similar. Is there any way we can see your hair?
Ashleyjasmine,pmbt3f,"It sounds like we have really similar hair! Everything sits on top of my hair, I only really use Aussie or Creme of Nature now. The thinner the product the better for me"
BadComplete8843,pmbt3f,I love this! Thanks for sharing. Might do the same for products I’ve tried.
CndyKsses,pmbt3f,It's always lovely hearing of others' experiences with hair care brands. Shea moisture is my go-to but its always refreshing to see how another natural woman's hair reacts. Is that the only thing that happened to your hair using it?
CoilyCurlyandCute,pmbt3f,"My hair is a journey.  When I first transitioned from relaxed to curly/natural, I used Miss Jessies.  I have found that since transitioning, my hair needs have changed.  I wash my hair every three weeks or when I know that the product is building up and doing nothing to provide definition.  I twist may hair nightly with some type of oil or product.  My go to brand is KeraVada.  I do an avocado mayonnaise protein treatment every three months.  What I have found is everyone's hair is different and has different needs.  What works for some may not work for others."
DYday,pmbt3f,Same
Daillestandrealist,pmbt3f,Love this list!!! Pretty similar to mines. Have you tried honey’s handmades yet?
DiCangro,pmbt3f,This is actually a really good idea.
ESQ2020,pmbt3f,This is everything!
LCG05,pmbt3f,I did the same when I went natural like 9 years ago. It crazy to see so many products out there for naturals that literally do nothing for my hair. When I use simple natural ingredients I get the best results.
Malikanahl,pmbt3f,"Yes very interesting! I’m high porosity and after years of searching found that it doesn’t matter what leave in I use as long as I seal it with Shea butter. I’ve since thrown everything out and only have 3 styling products: leave in (I use Shea moisture the orange one), any oil, homemade whipped Shea butter with oil I have on hand. That’s all I have used for the past 4 years and since then my hair has grown to my mid back."
MinPadThai,pmbt3f,"Thanks for sharing! Shea Moisture is so popular so I gave it a try a few years ago and it dried out my hair sooo much. I'm gonna try your list of ""likes""! :)"
Minimum-Local-4067,pmbt3f,Thanks for sharing! :)
Monasgma,pmbt3f,Thanks. Mane Choice is amazing. African pride is good too and Canvas. To each their own. This is an awesome chart.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Numerous_Web_8913,pmbt3f,"Innersense organic beauty is a great one to try. I'm a natural hair stylist,  and this product really sinks down into the hair and makes it moisturized,  yet still light."
Savageho3,pmbt3f,African pride ftw
Somewhat-wallflower,pmbt3f,"Hi everyone! I thought I should pop in here to say that Giovanni's hair care products have worked really well for my natural hair. I have only used their 50:50 line. But I hear tons of naturals love their smooth as silk line as well. I haven't heard alot of people in the natural hair community mention their products. Maybe because they aren't really known as a ""natural hair brand"".  But the ingredients are good. It's definitely an option if youre looking for something else to try out."
Storytella2016,pmbt3f,"Huh. If I were to do this, I’d have to go more granular. There are lots of brands where I can use one product but not all of their products."
Usual-Cat6451,pmbt3f,Mielle gives me definition like no other but the flakes that follow… mannnn 😫😫😫
VeganandlovingIt,pmbt3f,"This is awesome. For me, the only hair products that work for my hair are Naptural 85's line."
Weep-ngW-11ow,pmbt3f,"I’m surprised that As I Am sat on top, did you use a heat cap? That usually helps for me, but you did say you have super low porosity."
caprinatural,pmbt3f,"This is a really smart way of keeping track, thank you for sharing it with us!"
cookies_cream6,pmbt3f,Love it...finding a good product that works for you
frankiemang0,pmbt3f,"I couldn’t figure out wtf I didn’t like about tgin but oh my god. It literally sits on top, I knew I wasn’t crazy! It’s heavy af."
happyhippoking,pmbt3f,"This is so interesting! It also shows how different hair types are. A lot of the products and ingredients your hair dislikes, mine loves! My hair loves fatty alcohols and emollients. My hair prefers lightweight oils but heavy oils aren't it. It's low porosity as well.&&&Not OP. I love Honey's Handmade! They have a lot of products and it's overwhelming to shop but if you know the ingredients your hair likes, it's much easier to shop there. They have sales on like Tuesdays, Fridays and stuff. Sign up for their mail list. You can try their products very affordably using their sales.

I like their coconut water collection and honey replenishing collection. The worst products I've used, are still pretty okay/good. Nothing I've used made my hair feel worse."
petiteparamour,pmbt3f,I think Miellé is the “tried and true” for every natural. I personally like Camille Rose products too though
soulazuri,pmbt3f,This is amazing!!! It sounds like we have the same exact hair type! Can I ask what curl smith products you like because I’ve recently got into them :)
spacej0ck,pmbt3f,"6 Years Natural. List of Every Brand that Worked and Did Not Work for My Hair.&&&&&&It helps because then you can see what ingredients are either loved by or hated by your hair. Saves you time, money, and energy for sure.&&&CONTEXT: I am a 3c/4a/4b natural with the lowest porosity possible. I noticed that anything containing certain alcohols, an abundance of coconut oil or cheap oils, and mineral oil was immediately going to be rejected by my hair. The very few products that I *do* like are what helped me go from ear length to armpit length in a curly state. Although my hair is bra strap length and mid back length in a stretched state.&&&I was following this one YouTuber, Kimberley Cherrell. EVERYTHING she uses on her hair would never work on my hair even though we're close in textures. It's insane.&&&I wanted to like Camille Rose but for the price it did to my hair what Cantu does. So sad.&&&Took years and hundred of dollars \*cries\*. But I'm finally here. Didn't know I needed ""lightweight"" products this whole time.&&&For the sake of posting images here I didn’t want ro have too many columns. 

I use Mielle’s protein free deep conditioner but can’t use a single one of their leave in creams. 

For Curlsmith, from washing to styling I can thankfully use everything in their blue/scalp line. 

Skimdo only makes one product. 

Curls, I use their products for setting my styles (the pomade and the gel) but I can’t make their leave ins work for me. 

All the dislikes, I mostly tried a shampoo, conditioner, and leave in from them. With the exception of Cantu, Jane Carter, and TGIN. That is a LOT of money wasted. So I had at least three product types to analyze among the rest listed. And it was an unsatisfactory experience.&&&Absolutely. It's kind of infuriating how much trial and error and MONEY we all kind of have to sacrifice to get a good routine going. At the same time, what works for me may not even remotely work for someone with my exact hair profile. SO COMPLICATED&&&No problem!!! If anyone else has extreme porosity issues I hope some of my likes (which are so few it's SAD lol) work for them.&&&Enjoy!! Specifically for Curlsmith anything with the blue label, my hair can actually absorb. I have a cabinet full of their products for when I run out of one. I love them so much. 

Skimdo is damn near impossible to get hands on but if you do, prepare to be addicted for life. 

Mielle's protein-free deep conditioner and their white peony leave in are what I live by...but I cannot use their leave-in creams. At all. Their edge control is wonderful as well.&&&Doesn't work for me :( I forgot to list them. But if someone scrolling sees this and it helps them then that's all good!!!&&&I’ll see if I can post it here. I already used one image so I’d have to link it and that’s a whole other thing&&&I wanted to like it!! As you can see I’ve pretty much tried close to everything that’s advertised to natural hair chicks and some of these companies are just doing it wrong and don’t care.&&&In the earlier days I copy and pasted all the ingredients and then did a CTRL + F to see all the common denominators. This helped me get to the products I actually like because they don’t contain the same ingredients.&&&I feel dumb for falling for it but I used to buy the stuff that said “definition, elongation” all those buzzwords. And what was the stuff my hair didn’t like lol. 

Now I know you get definition from proper technique, hydration, and ensuring your hair dries completely. And sometimes you might only need one product for that!&&&I just found every product of theirs would either leave my hair feeling like straw or just sit on top of my hair. *even their low porosity line.* I’m astounded when it actually works for people.&&&I’ve done everything. But As I Am uses ingredients that don’t mesh with me. And I mostly dislike their leave in creams. I tried everything. Soaking my hair, dipping it in a cup of water, my hair just can’t absorb their leave ins. 

And I’m not a cowasher anymore, I know As I Am is popular for that, it does nothing for me bc I actually have an oily scalp (weird for a natural) so I shampoo in place of cowashing.&&&I wish I could go three weeks without buildup.&&&It is a godsend. Be wary of their quiz though. I use everything from their blue line. But because I have some type 4 hair, they think I need to use the orange line. The orange line is too heavy for me based on porosity.&&&I haven't, once I found a sweet spot between using Mielle for my deep conditions, Curlsmith for my clarifying and styling, and Skimdo for strictly styling...that's been my routine for two years. If Honey's is extremely honey or plant-based I'll most likely get buld-up.&&&which products are you using? Funny thing is I buy about 5 bottle of their protein-free conditioner at a time but when it comes to their leave-ins...I completely agree with you.&&&I have to use a ton of excel sheets for my business so when I make a fun one that's not formatted, it gives me a lot of joy lol.&&&I wanted to love it *so* bad. I love her videos though, they're extremely helpful."
starryeyedsurprise12,pmbt3f,You are my kinda person!!
wiinii1204,pmbt3f,I’ve been meaning to try Curlsmith! Still figuring out what my hair likes and so far it’s been a challenge…
AceAconite,pmb0t8,"Cantu leave-in is my ride or die, but I use Shea Moisture for my shampoo and conditioner. I also use As I am for my heat protectant and twisting cream. I'm 4c with low porosity though,  so we may be a bit different."
AzariaZahara,pmb0t8,"Cantu always flakes up in my hair. I've used it eith water, oil, I've used less, I used more, nothing works, it always flakes.

However it works for me mom. And is very hydrating for her hair. 

It probably just depends on porosity and other factors.

Some people also don't like the ingredients in it as well."
Daillestandrealist,pmb0t8,"I don’t like there ingredient lists personally, they always have mineral oil or petroleum in there products and they tend to make my hair feel hard. 

I also have 3c/4a/4b hair but it really depends more on your hair’s porosity, I have high porosity and some moisturizing leave In conditioners i use are Mielle Organics Hawaiian Ginger leave in, or honeys handmade’s avocado leave-in. For a protein leave in I’ll use Mielle organic’s avocado hair milk or honey’s handmades yucca mango strengthening lotion, or curls blueberry bliss leave it.

For gels I swear by Mielle Organics pomegranate and honey curl coil custard, or kinky curly knot today curl custard (but it’s hard to find leave ins that go well with the kinky curly custard)

I hope this gives clarity and helps!"
Infinite-Swordfish97,pmb0t8,"I love Cantu come back curls and leave in conditioning mist. I use them every morning, no issues and it’s been years"
Kcvexo,pmb0t8,I never hated it just didnt work in my hair. Worked better in my sister hair tbh
Peanut0131,pmb0t8,"I have 3c/4a as well, I can send you my routine if you'd like?"
Usual-Cat6451,pmb0t8,Flakes like crazy. I thought that I had dandruff for years.
YoYo_ismael,pmb0t8,Why the Cantu hate? And what do you suggest instead of it (3C/4A)&&&&&&I am also low porosity&&&Hell yeah
carlacom,pmb0t8,I also have 3c/4a and use taliah waajid curl defining crime
eonsaftereons,pmb0t8,"i used to use the conditioner and deep conditioner when i first started doing my own hair about three years and to be honest they were okay, the deep conditioner ... couldve been better but honestly i dont see why cantu got so much hate besides the trash ingredients. the styling products hate is warranted because all it does it flake and make (my) hair feel dry"
hanap8127,pmb0t8,The kinky curly leave in doesn’t pair well with the custard?&&&It feels good immediately but does nothing for long term health. I like uncle funkys curly magic.
ifelondonttrustyou,pmb0t8,"I shed so much when I used Cantu. My hair looked nice when I used it but but long term use is a no for me. Also, I noticed my hair felt dehydrated overtime..it seemed it sucked at retaining moisture. I have 3c/4a hair"
lavasca,pmb0t8,It simply doesn’t work on my skin. Also the texture is one that I find bizarre. If it works for you then awesome.
Bear_Bones_mom,pm7hwk,Nothing has worked as well for me as CurlMix but the masque from this line was really moisturizing
ChocolateNapqueen,pm7hwk,The hair mask is amazing. I haven’t tried the other two.
CndyKsses,pm7hwk,I have not used the entire line but I've definitely used the hair masque. It does its job and it does it well. My high porosity hair loves it
Dylanspencer13,pm7hwk,I only buy black owned hair care products. I’d encourage you to do the same.
Flabby2FitFoodie,pm7hwk,"Hated and returned. Full disclosure to date I've only truly liked one Shea Moisture product, the Deep Cleansing Shampoo, and then they went & changed it 🙄 at this point I've given up on this line."
Franklyn_Gage,pm7hwk,The hairmask is my favorite. I have low porosity hair btw
JazzyG17,pm7hwk,"Just like everyone has stated, the mask is amazing. Definitely recommend"
Just_ate_ur_,pm7hwk,Have 4c low porosity hair and the mask did nothing for it .

KEnyinna,pm7hwk,"Yes, I love it. I use the shampoo and masque on my daughter's hair once a week."
Miriam-Esi,pm7hwk,You can go to target and buy the sample size of the mask to see if you like or before you buy
Narrow-Maximum,pm7hwk,Yes. It smells divine.
OvertureStealer,pm7hwk,The shampoo is ok and the conditioner did nothing for me but looks like people in the comments really like the mask so I might have to try it lol. I got a sample size strengthen and restore mask from SM that I thought was pretty good so maybe their masks are worth it
Popcopybabe32,pm7hwk,TGIN>Shea Moisture
Quiet_Rip8607,pm7hwk,don’t really like many shea moisture stuff. even they’re black soap i had to stop using cause it stopped working
RabbitWednesday,pm7hwk,What does tgin stand for?
Rciccioni,pm7hwk,Absolutely love their whole product line .
VariousCelery7826,pm7hwk,I got the hydration milk and it works so well on my hair
Weary_Umpire_6219,pm7hwk,Yes!!! I use all these currently.
YalaRosei,pm7hwk,"Loved the hair masque when I had my hands on it, worked well for my low porosity hair, especially when I used heat with it. Haven't used the shampoo and conditioner tho"
acidnvbody,pm7hwk,I hate Shea Moisture all together but I only use the mask from this line and the JBCO line.
arincer,pm7hwk,YES. the moisture from the masque is something serious.
atctia,pm7hwk,That hair mask is amazing. I hated the shampoo and conditioner though
bottledbed,pm7hwk,I have low porosity 4b/c hair. I love the shampoo and masque ive been using it for years. I also love the smell.
caprinatural,pm7hwk,"Preach! Ever since I've discovered TGIN, I've kicked Shea Moisture to the curb. I believe most of their formulas have changed too, so it was only a matter of time, tbf. I now only use the JBCO leave in from SM.&&&I used them before. The shampoo was decent, cleaned my hair, but didn't strip it either. The conditioner and the mask were trash, however. They did nothing for my hair abnd left it dry af. Most of the SM products do nothing for my hair anymore.


EDIT: I forgot to mention that I have 4b/c hair that's normal to high in porosity."
disneysslythprincess,pm7hwk,They are fine but remember honey is a humectant so DONT use this line in the winter as it will slowly remove moisture.
ebrdshw,pm7hwk,My hair loves this line!
eonsaftereons,pm7hwk,"i can only speak on the conditioner and deep conditioner. i adoreee the deep conditioner 10/10, the conditioner is a 6-7/10"
favouriteblues,pm7hwk,I love the mielle protein free too! My ride or die
faye-marie,pm7hwk,I used the mask when I chopped. I prefer the black castor oil one. But I’ve stopped using it.
iimaluv,pm7hwk,Great products. My daughter has curly thick hair and they work great on her hair.
jellypegs,pm7hwk,I like the hair mask and I love to add even more honey to it lol and then placing the container in some hot water before I use it
meahbuka,pm7hwk,Their best line!!! Love the hairmask it’s my holy grail
montilyetsss,pm7hwk,"When I used to use their products I loved this line, super moisturizing and that mask was the BEST."
omgidfk123,pm7hwk,"I don't mess with shea moisture like that, but their hair mask lives up to it's name"
rossablue,pm7hwk,"Their products don’t work with my hair. I tried the Raw Sugar products since I couldn’t find the AG products that I use, and I ended up loving that brand."
satanic_panic_90,pm7hwk,It’s my favorite mask
seaduckies,pm7hwk,"Yes! It was my go-to when I started SM. However, after a few months it started drying out my hair. ... but it was a good start until I found something better."
socrazyitscool,pm7hwk,I have it smells really good and made my hair really soft
spacej0ck,pm7hwk,I've given up fully on SM. They have let me down too many times. Just SAT on top of my hair and made it feel like straw.&&&dried my hair out like a mfer. I can't use *anything* Shea Moisture makes. I use Curlsmith and Mielle (protein-free deep conditioner!!!) products for my low porosity hair.
spinachbuteaten,pm7hwk,"TGIN, Eden, and even Texture ID r all better. If you can afford it As I am is also good"
stealthpursesnatch,pm7hwk,I use that hair mask with another Shea Moisture shampoo and some of their moisturizers. No complaints.
swu98,pm7hwk,Love the hair mask and it lasts a while because it’s so thick and you don’t need too much
thefallofthehouse,pm7hwk,"I have the hair mask, and it's become one of my favorite products. it smells really good and makes my hair so soft and moisturized (I have low porosity hair). 

I know a lot of people are iffy about Shea Moisture, but my hair doesn't really like anything else I've tried. I've tried Carol's Daughter, Cantu (ugh, I know), Mane & Tail, etc. Shea Moisture seems to be the only thing that gives me the results I'm wanting!"
