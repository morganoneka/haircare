AdmirablePangolin,dr5ehe,Hmm idk the only time I‚Äôve had people burn down the entire length of my braid is to singe off any strays and to make them look more neat (I got worried when she did it but ultimately when I took off the braids my hair was ok) but to straighten the braids...never heard of that
Aesthetii,dr5ehe,"Okay, so I have a question..&&&Recently, I got box braids done by my mom's friend. In order to make the braids more straight, she got a lighter and she burnt all of each braid. When I say all, I mean to where she begun the them to the ends.  

Is my hair gonna be okay when I take it out? It's armpit-length.

EDIT: I meant straight, not loose. Sorry.&&&Do you think it will stunt the growth of my hair?&&&She actually did it in order to straighten the braids. I'm kinda scared to take my hair out because she never did that before."
LadyJae94,dr5ehe,Sorry sweetheart... She was not suppose to burn the whole braid. Only around the ends where your hair is not. Yes some of your hair will be burned now. And now you know to keep her ass away from your hair. Just because someone can braid hair doesn't mean they are suppose to braid hair. She need to do her research before doing anything to anyone. I'm so sorry darling! ‚ù§üôè
SandyGreensRd,dr5ehe,"How long are the braids? If they are past arm pit length, your hair will be okay."
TeaLover315,dr5ehe,Did she tell you that she was trying to make them looser? That doesn‚Äôt make them looser? When you burn down the lefty of the braid it makes them look neater
Worstmodonreddit,dr5ehe,They used to do this in the 90s. It's so that any strays melt to the rest of the added hair. It's probably not great for your hair but if she just ran a lighter over it you probably won't even notice the damage tbh.
haireveryshare,dr5ehe,"She is saying the woman burnt them from scalp ‚Äúall/where she begun‚Äù to end.  :(

OP: She probably burnt some of your natural hair too.  I would expect some breakage.  But also, how does this make them loser??"
visolana7,dr5ehe,Youre only supposed to burn the end so it doesn't unravel. It seals the synthetic hair . The braids loosen on their own... Burning it to loosen it doesn't make any sense
zsaz_ch,dr5ehe,"For future reference if the braids are long you boil water and dip the braids and that will make them not so stiff. I‚Äôve been getting braids all my life and have not not gotten any damage using this method. If your natural hair is long  don‚Äôt dip them too far up the length of the braid or just use a steamed towel. Don‚Äôt let anyone use a lighter on your hair unless you are getting a braided bob and they are lighting the very very very ends. 
Now from what you just experienced you MAY not have heat damage but you will definitely need a trim as your end are going to be through."
Gain-Boy,dqhshz,"Growing hair guide?&&&So I've always understood shampooing once every week two weeks.
I understand using the loc method once a week or so.
But a lot of these are based on having hair long enough to put into a protective style.

What if you're 4A/4B hair is too short to do so? I wear a durag to sleep, I loc once a week, I shampoo once a week.

Is there like a guide I can follow? Like am I meant to just use styling cream the rest of the days? Or add oil on certain days etc.

Any advice is appreciated.&&&Hey thanks for the post. Lots of great tips to follow.

Could you give me a 7 day breakdown?"
M_Aku,dqhshz,"When my hair was much shorter I didn't do any protective styling at all(only cause it was too short). I have type 4b/4c hair. I also do the LCO method now and find that it keeps moisture in much longer.  Adding oil on its own only leads to buildup. 

 As for growing hair for length, I recommend taking extra care of your ends. Type 4 hair is coily and prone to dryness so regularly trimming and moisturizing is a huge part in retaining length.

Also find products that work for you and stick with those. Don't be afraid to try products that aren't advertised for your hair type specifically.  I personally use Aussie Shampoo and Deep Conditioner and it's working great.  Keep your wash routine regular as well. Deep condition every wash day with a shower cap because without heat the product will basically sit on your hair. If you don't already I recommend a leave in conditioning cream as well. Then seal with an oil of your choice. 

Hopefully that was helpful."

a_n_l,dqe4tx,"My big chop :)&&&Hey! I‚Äôm new here ü§© 

So I cut my hair for the 3rd time in August 2018. [This ](https://imgur.com/a/aTDCgAI) was a few weeks after. 

And [this ](https://imgur.com/a/kN0H0xv) was in June 2019. 

Lol, I‚Äôm guilty of not taking good consistency of my hair lately so I don‚Äôt have a now pic but I definitely owe myself a nice hair mask. I can‚Äôt believe how much my hair has grown. I was scared to cut it because I didn‚Äôt know if it would grow. I‚Äôve been thinking about getting my hair loc‚Äôd but I might try faux locs first :)"
CoffeeB4Talkie,dq91kr,"I have what I believe is low porosity hair. My hair does not like coconut oil. Not a fan of olive oil either.

It seems to like avocado oil and sweet almond oil. I've used DC with other oils that seem to be okay. 

I use JBCO when I Deep condition, but that HAS to be rinsed out. I can't leave that in. It's too thick, my hair doesn't like it as a leave in product."
Galacticstew101,dq91kr,"Hey naturals, could really use your wisdom, (on new natural journey)&&&Hey Queens!
I could really use the communities help.

I have both curl type 3C, 4C & B
I‚Äôm on a new hair journey, finally giving my hair the TLC it needs.
Doing online research has had such mixed information so I‚Äôm now confused.
I believe I have low porosity hair, my roots take a long time to dry but the rest dries a little quicker.
My hair is very prone to breakage and is very hard to detangle daily. 
I tried using coconut oil but my hair hates it, it gets really dry.



If you could answer any of these questions to help my journey, it would mean so much. 

1. From your experience what oils have and haven‚Äôt worked for you? 

2. Also what oil combinations have you seen the most success? Combining light & thick oils? 

3. If you infused the oil with anything to help with growth what types of herbs did you use? Did it make your hair thicker/prevent shrinkage?

4. I‚Äôve read good things about these oils, any experience with it helping seal without drying?
Jojoba oil 
Almond oil 
Marula oil 
Moringa oil 
Boabab oil 
Hempseed oil
Avocado oil 
Rosehip oil 



Thank you for all of your help, it‚Äôs really going to help me finally take care of my Maine.&&&Ahh thank you so much, I‚Äôm going to try out mixing avocado and almond oil. 
What is DC oil? Is the castor oil too thick when you use it by itself too?"
Kmathwiz,dq91kr,"I use Jamaican Black Castor oil and a little bit of peppermint oil to help stop breakage/shedding and help grow my hair out. 

Also protective hair styles have helped with my growth a lot because of how bad my breakage can be when I leave it down. 

Honestly, its gonna be a lot of experimenting to find what works, it took me two years to find products that I liked. Keep going and you'll find what works"
ProfessionalBinger_,dq91kr,"1. My fave oils: avocado, olive, almond/ least fave: coconut or castor 
2. Combining any of my faves mixed in with vitamin e and peppermint has helped my hair and scalp tremendously 
3. Try applying peppermint oil to your scalp or eucalyptus and massaging for a few minutes a day 

I have medium/ high porosity hair"

Sarah1777,dpvhb2,"I big chopped today, after 18 months of transition!!! (pic right side up this time LOL)&&&&&&Thank you!! I feel so LIGHT!&&&Haha I tried so many different things for YT during transition it‚Äôs insane. But my basics are : 
- wash day every 7-8 days
- deep condition every wash day
- rice water prepoo once a month
- LCO or LOC +milk when my hair needs extra moisturizing.
For this first ever wash‚Äôn go, I used the Mielle Pom&Honey leave in, the Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-in (I find the mielle good for prep but not moisturizing enough), the Mielle Pom&Honey coil custard and Jojoba oil to finish off!&&&It was so freeing!!

clairepyl,dpq9j5,"I think an underrated protective style is keeping the hair wrapped!   Great for winter, and would be a barrier between you and your hair.  The different prints/colors and wrapping methods make it a diverse look that will work no matter the length of your hair.  Just make sure you use a silk/satin fabric to wrap or a silk/satin cap underneath if you try it."
haireveryshare,dpq9j5,"hey I have the same thing! 

I used to pull out my hair when I was anxious, or even just bored. When I was a teen  it was to the point where one of my ignorant friends asked if I ‚Äúhad leukemia?‚Äù  I still have it.  I know it doesn‚Äôt go away, not for long anyway, the urge is still there. 

I actually found the closest thing to a ‚Äòcure‚Äô for me...

I pulled my hair because I‚Äôd single one out that felt irregular or just ‚Äòhad to go‚Äô then another and another compulsively.  I started channeling that compulsion into doing ‚Äúsearch and destroy‚Äù instead of pulling.  I‚Äôve learn to ‚Äòhunt‚Äô for splits and damage and trim those in lieu of pulling.  It is equally satisfying now, and feels better than pulling! 

It IS still compulsive, and I wish I didn‚Äôt have to do it, but at least my hair gets better [or breaks even health-wise, due to the manipulation] in the process."
twamp14,dpq9j5,"Need help!&&&My hair has always been a struggle.  I'm mixed (Black/White) and my hair reflects it.  When wet, it's wavy on top and curls up in the back. I've been natural and short styles since May 2014. 

I also have trichotillomania (pull my hair out when I'm stressed) and have had to keep it short because it gets so uneven with all the pulling. 

Are there any protective styles I can do to help keep my hair protected? Product suggestions are also welcome!&&&I wrap my hair at night but would feel awkward wrapping it during the day."
CoffeeB4Talkie,dpq8j7,Interesting. I never thought of it as a protein overload issue. Hmm....
JustLurkingHereMan,dpq8j7,"Many of my fairy knots are caused by me wearing my hair out in it's shrunken state (a wash n go). I find that when I twist/braid my hair for a twist-out/braid-out, I get less of them because it's more of a controlled style and the hair isn't left to be free and curl up on itself. I always happen to get more on one section of my hair because the curls are tighter than the rest of my hair."
ProfessionalBinger_,dpq8j7,"Fairy knots are most commonly caused from protein overload or lack of detangling. The best advice I could give you is to use hair scissors to cut the ones you have and detangle your hair more often bc they‚Äôre caused from the curls intertwining. Also just be more mindful about the amount of protein going into your hair but like I said, the thing that‚Äôs worked the best for me was dusting/ eliminating my existing knots and detangling, first with a wide tooth and then following up with a smaller comb, Ideally a rat tail"
Queenie-amor,dpq8j7,"Fairy knots&&&I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to deal with fairy knots? Or how to avoid them all together!&&&Yes! I always get them in the back of my head more so than the front where my curl pattern is very loose&&&I try and keep my hair 2 strand twisted as much as possible but even then my hair eventually starts knitting together. When it is out in a fro/wash and go, that is when I experience them the most! I have to cut fairy knots out so often it‚Äôs ridiculous!&&&Smh I know the pain! I had a knot close to the root of my hair, and I have no idea how it got there. I had to use my detangling brush to get it out it was ridiculous."
becausesleep,dpq8j7,"Posting because I have the same issue. I suppose some are inevitable, but I try to avoid hoards of them by always having my ends in a restrained style. Meaning they can't touch, move, bounce, wave, meet up with each other/themselves.


When I do puffs, braid outs, twistouts, I get so many it's unreal. When I come across them on wash day I'll cut them out with shears but I'll stop after about 10 of them.


If you find a way please let me know <3"
brainsweeties,dpq8j7,"I have no idea but I wish I did smh. When I don't stretch my hair, there's more knots but they're loose enough to get rid of with running water or product. When I stretch my hair, there's less knots but they're so tight that I have to cut them, and I loose hella length because a lot of times I'll get knots like halfway up the hair strand. So I just suffer üò≠"
