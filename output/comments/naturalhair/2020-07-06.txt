KindResist0,hq6qcw,I didn’t have a problem w the emerge gel other than I don’t like how liquidy it is. Not everyone’s hair takes stuff the same 🤷🏾‍♀️
MysticSpiral666,hq6qcw,"I just got my first curly cut about a month ago and the stylist recommended I
use that line."
disneysslythprincess,hq6qcw,Honestly at this point I only trust Shea Moisture or homemade products. Everything else always has something to mess you up! Thanks for the review!
redditaccount_1234,hq6qcw,"I have type 4 hair and actually had the opposite effect.  My hair has been a lot easier to detangle and my wash and gos have been great. I'm using the whole set though of shampoo, conditioner and leave in ."
the_artsy_plant,hq6qcw,"DONT USE EMERGE PRODUCTS&&&So, I’ve been natural and using natural hair care products for about a year or two now, and recently, I decided to switch up my routine. 

I swapped out my usual Shea moisture coconut conditioner with an Emerge Conditioner. 

For context, my hair is type 3 (a combination of a, b, and c). I struggle with frizz, split ends, my scalp, and the fact that my hair is a different texture in the front and the back. 

The Shea moisture conditioner was doing pretty well, but I wanted to experiment a bit and switch it up. The Emerge product claimed to be all natural without sulfates, parabens, or silicones, so I thought nothing could go wrong. Boy was I stupid to think that. 

I’ve been using the Emerge conditioner for a few weeks, washing every two days. It’s been a nightmare. At first, my hair loved the switch up, but then it all went to hell. 

My hair was getting tangles in ways it never did and my ends were starting to split like crazy (even though I got my hair cut a week before using Emerge’s products). My hair was frizzing up like never before. And my scalp has been so so itchy. 

And now today, my third or fourth wash day with Emerge, my curls are beginning to lose their texture. 

So please, if you’re natural and you love your hair, then please don’t use these products. You’ll regret it so much.&&&No problem! After I throw emerge away, I’m gonna go back to the brands I can trust ❤️. (Personally I like Kinky Curly, Camille Rose, and Mielle along with Shea Moisture)&&&That’s great for you, however, I’m still disappointed with how the product worked for me. Judging by other people’s replies on this thread and reviews on YouTube and Target’s site, Emerge works best for type 4 hair, yet they advertise their products as for both curly AND coily textures. In my opinion, they should have advertised differently, so that people with type 3 hair could avoid this product. In my opinion, they casted too broad of a net for their products.&&&I’m specifically talking about the conditioner in this post though as this is the product I tried."
LordSlader,hq42d1,"How do i maintain the box braid style and prevent fizz (male)&&&This is my first time having box braids, how to i maintain them and what are the things i should and shouldnt do when i have them? Is it ok if i wet them? and if i do, how do i prevent the frizz"
satanic_panic_90,hq42d1,Wet them as little as possible and wrap your hair at night
who_angel,hq2kpi,how long should your hair be for 2 feed ins?&&&
IrieReign,hq0yv6,"WASH DAY• 1 No Detangle, 2 Moisturized and Detangled, 3 Air Dried&&&&&&Thank you! 🤗
I’m excited to see it thriving after so many years of trial and error and frizz 😬😅&&&Thanks 💜Yeah definitely! For me, it’s all about aeration. I flip my hair around a lot when it’s drying. I even hanging my head upside down and scrunch my hair up to promote a tighter curl. 

I hardly ever set or twist my hair to create a curl pattern, I exclusively air dry, so in a way, it’s like curl memory. They’ve found their texture through repetition.

You can also go lenient on the styling products when your hair is wet (just enough to detangle) so the hair isn’t weighed down. If if gets fuzzy or dry you can always re-wet and moisturize with a conditioner/water spray. Good luck!&&&I detangle in the shower during deep conditioning or once my hair is dry. I use the same spray I mentioned earlier in the thread and spray a wide-toothed comb. I work ends to root spraying more along the way. I take my time with it to minimize breakage. 

I detangle while I watch Netflix and not in front of a mirror so I’m only focused on how it feels. Helps me be gentler 😊 

I hope this helps!"
dumb-funsies,hq0yv6,Your hair is gorgeous!! 😍
ismololo,hq0yv6,Your curls look amazing!👌🏾 can I ask how did you get them to clump and curl into that shape? I’m trying to get a defined springy cork screw curl but my hair stays mostly flat (similar to pic 2).
lusigusi,hq0yv6,Your hair looks so good!!! We have similar curl patterns so I’m curious about the part where you mention no detangling. How do you get the tangles out??
shortcurlyhaircuts,hq0yv6,Awesome
starrgrrl,hq0yv6,I came to here to say all of this. Lol.. Similar curl pattern but tangles/knots are my #1 enemy. Always ready to hear a new detangling secret!
xxxshoshoxxx,hq0yv6,Oh my gosh 😍😍😍😍
EloquentElixir,hq0srp,"4Z Hair products&&&Howdy yall, how's it going?

I just wanted to know if anyone else here has tried 4Z Hair products? She's a small company and I know I've recommended her here before and was curious to see how other folk liked it 🤔"
EoinSalt,hq0pvm,How many votes for the work ?&&&
Tegaclifford,hq000q,How to DEEP CONDITION A LOW POROSITY HAIR&&&
rbusch34,hpxxqp,Loving it! Looks healthy 😊
spacej0ck,hpxxqp,Length Check. Got more comfortable with my shrinkage this year. (Hair is in a four day old twist out)&&&&&&Thank you 🙏🏾
Aromatic_Republic,hpw2ob,Can you explain this a little more please?
Ashleyjasmine,hpw2ob,"Do you have low porosity hair? Green beauty on YouTube had a video on why twist outs can come out stiff and wiry on low po hair. Personally I just do wash and goes or blow dries now though.

If you’re interested though I did get one good twist out using mousse and one other time using the Camille rose hair milk as a leave on soaking wet hair then the coconut style setter to twist my hair when it was damp. I feel like the leave in helps to keep my definition whilst drying."
Lukasmom,hpw2ob,I have the same problem as OP. I'm going to def try that. Thanks!
Percipience_8,hpw2ob,"I know I’m a tad late, but you could also try Carol’s Daughter Mimosa Hair Honey to seal in moisture, and focus on your ends while applying it before you twist or braid the section of hair. I have 3b hair, but my boyfriend has 4c hair. He uses Cantu on his hair, and when I would undo his twist outs his ends looked like this and his hair would frizz and tangle up after day 2. I started putting the hair honey in his hair after working the Cantu through, and it keeps it way more moisturized and defined for a lot longer than just Cantu alone.
You may also want to put a little bit of product or oil on your finger tips and lightly finger coil your ends when you take your hair down. This will add extra moisture and help your twist out or braid outs hold their desired shape for longer. It takes a little more time, but I think it’s worth it."
Zaylyn5355,hpw2ob,I don't like doing braid or twist outs because of the frizz when separating. Its like you're messing up the set you created. That's why i do wash and gos instead.
aclusterlove,hpw2ob,Do you regularly deep condition with heat? Or L.O.C. method? It helps retain moisture
cryingalotT_T,hpw2ob,"Why is my hair like this after twist out 😭😭always frizzy, dry, the ends are all raggedy eventhough I just trimmed a few days ago😭😭 I feel so hopeless I do everything right but to no avail 😭&&&&&&The only time I did a wash n go was two years ago because my hair got all tangled since its high porosity T_T but I'm thinking of trying again this year maybe things will be different and I think maybe I did something wrong that time"
monicajoi,hpw2ob,"You should never share/borrow hair ( evening out the sections to continue the braid or twist) when braiding or twisting, this leads to frizzy braids & twist outs."
orjazzmic,hpw2ob,"You can try using a light to medium hold gel + a styler when doing twist-outs. I noticed that helped me a lot with frizz. You could also try not to separate as much when you take down your twists. I noticed my hair gets bigger and fluffier naturally throughout the day anyway and when I would separate too much, my hair would just be a frizzy mess by the end of the day"
sunnyleopard,hpw2ob,Use gel in your twist outs. Trust me.
vengefulhart,hpw2ob,"I find my hair does this too if I put oil on it. If the oil is already in a product it's fine but pure oil, hair is just like nope lol. Eventually I just stopped using oils and replaced it with a whipped butter or hair grease in my regimen."
CGBio,hpuncv,Any recommendations for hair products/websites would be hugely appreciated!&&&
InterestingAnything3,hpuncv,I love the Briogeo don’t despair repair mask! Briogeo is a black owned company and that mask is packed with protein

BabynBella,hpqemq,"Honey, get your braids and live your life. As long as you’re not trying to pull a Rachel Dolezal you’re good."
Kaylxx_sm,hpqemq,"If it looks tasteful, the person wearing the style doesn't try to act black, and their hair can handle this particular style(some non black people's hair is horrible at taking black hair styles because the styles themselves weren't originally for such hair) I think this style in particular is fine"
dolphinne,hpqemq,"Hmmm nah I wouldn't say so. There's a line between culture appreciation and culture appreciation. If a non black person wears braids while enjoying it and enjoys/loves black/African culture (also wanting to learn more),then that's culture appreciation.

Now, if they were to profit off braids or say something like ""Oh I created braids you can't tell me otherwise"" for clout or they're being ignorant along with being disrespectful then that's culture appropriation."
who_angel,hpqemq,"would 2 feed in braids on a white or otherwise nonblack person be cultural appropriation?&&&i'm getting mixed opinions on this, though i'd ask here"
bluplaydoh,hpqage,I have the Ez Detangler one and it’s honestly my favorite quarantine purchase.
boopalooo,hpqage,"I didn’t leave this brush? I have super thick coarse hair and I feel like it didn’t really make detangle good any easier for me. That and it kept slipping out of my grip which was really annoying. I don’t use it much anymore, the flexible lift is cool but for my hair I need a little more sturdiness to get it through."
dolphinne,hpqage,I think they're pretty good/useful but it overall depends on the person's hair. I've seen some women on Youtube say they love it but I saw some comments on different vids saying it's not for them or they don't want/recommend it. I have a knock off version of it but it works pretty well
jouska_exulansis,hpqage,I have the EZ Detangler brush (exact same thing) and i LOVE it
monicajoi,hpqage,"These are all knock offs of the Felicia Leatherwood brush✊🏿. I have that one and I love it. I can fully detangle and get all shed hair in 4-6 passes of each section.&&&The Felicia Leatherwood one is sturdy, based on comments I guess it's just preference."
rejectedfromeverywhe,hpqage,Has anyone tried the curltastic brush? Wht are your thoughts on it?&&&
walmartheiress,hpqage,"Same. I was so excited to use it, but I strongly prefer my Denman."
who_angel,hpqage,"i have a leatherwood one and the main ripoff, and honestly i prefer the ripoff. it has more ""give"" to it if you get what i'm saying&&&it looks just like the ez detangler and i love that one."
Buttercream_Brat,hpozle,"There are different forms/kinds of alopecia. Some can be reversed others can't, I think sol forms can be treated with medication and other can't. If it's possible to see your doctor, or even a dermatologist, he/she can diagnose it and then help form a treatment plan. If seeing your doctor isn't feasible, you might call them up and see if they have suggestions for regrowth in the meantime while covid takes its path. 

As far as castor oil goes, a friend has used it to help regrowth after the devacurl fiasco a few months ago and it has helped so much! She also uses it on her brows and lashes, but those were healthy hair follicles that just needed encouragement."
JugginTre,hpozle,Question&&&Im 17 and i believe that i have developed a form of alopecia in the back of my head. Like hair is growing everywhere else but that one spot and it looks bad. Also i have hair that is growing thin is one spot on the top of my head so there is a dip like area there. I just wanna know like is this a permanent thing because hair used to grow there so like is this normal cause of puberty or is it my diet idrk but any advice would be greatly appreciated. I can provide pictures to if u want to know what the areas look like&&&also should i change up the products im using and what products should i add to my arsenal
deezcurlz,hpozle,I heard that castor oil helps with this. Currently testing it on my son now.
AdamantiumFoil,hpie8j,"For box braids? I stretch it with a blow dryer then moisturize each section before braiding, so I guess stretched and slightly damp?"
FrankiLu,hpie8j,Damp hair because wet would never dry!
atctia,hpie8j,Both. But more often on damp hair
ismololo,hpie8j, mostly dry hair (70% -80% dry).
princessjanae,hpie8j,Definitely damp hair
who_angel,hpie8j,do you braid on wet/damp hair or stretched hair?&&&
