IAmTwistedT,o9c83q,Straight From The Country🤘🏾&&&
Storytella2016,o9bznd,"I think those are finger waves, but not 100%"
badgyaldridri,o9bznd,Um is that Denzel Washington and I’m pretty sure it’s called half up half down
golgiapparadus,o9bznd,Does anyone know what this hairstyle is called? I would like to copy it with my own hair but I don’t know how&&&
ontariodwarf,o9bznd,Maybe a crown flat twist? I’ve seen this done but it’s usually tighter - this looks like the same idea but done more loosely
BeautyOfaWolf,o99y28,"Looks like a mixture of 4a-4c. Possibly 3c as well. The longer your hair gets, your curls will stretch out more. But 4a-4c for sure!"
Wertyasda,o99y28,"It’s still early to say, but I agree with the other comment. I can confidently say 4A... could be 4B as-well.

Your hair will stretch in time."
kitty2katnniss,o99y28,What is my hairtype? I shaved my head about a year ago and my curls grew back differently (hair air dried after a wash + leave in conditioner)&&&&&&Thank you!
Mean_Tomatillo_9499,o98zv9,"Being natural, I think, is mostly about embracing healthier hair practices. I think it's fine to wear your hair straightened most of the time. Your journey is personal, so do what's best for you. You can always try more textured styles in the future. And check out Olaplex. I just started using it and like it so far. It may help with potential damage from straightening."
Raddi_maddi,o98zv9,"I agree with what most people said, it’s your hair, do what’s best for you. But my first question would be: why don’t you feel pretty with natural hair?
If you don’t want to be natural because it’s too much work, I completely understand that and deal with that struggle myself (it’s a lot ._.)

But if you don’t want to be natural because you don’t think you look pretty, that’s a different issue (that I also struggled with).

Watching videos, tv shows, movies of people with natural hair helped me 1) get ideas for cute styles 2) normalize natural hair (I have grow up around mostly white people so flat hair = cute hair)

I think to improve your self esteem you might also have to set different standards for your hair, for example, when I wear my hair straight I want every piece to be perfect and uniform. But when I wear my hair curly, I have to accept that some curls are looser than the others, and curls sometimes just go where they wanna go. I try to embrace it and style my hair in whatever way it’s flowing for the day. I have grown to like it, it’s like my hair has its own personality. 

But this whole thing is a journey so you can always go straight for a while and come back to natural later on when you feel the next urge 😆"
Rude_Suggestion_,o98zv9,"I think I want to be done with my natural hair journey, I hate it.&&&I hate my natural hair. I don’t feel pretty. It’s always in a bun.

I want to go back to straightening my hair but I have a fear of doing that because I have been on my natural hair journey for 5 years. But I am over it. It is so nappy and tangled up and I only get two good days from my wash and go’s (that take 3 plus hours). I know if I go back to straightening my hair everyday I will cause heat damage. But maybe it’s worth the risk to build back my self esteem.

Please help."
Tatcheez,o98zv9,"I might get downvoted for this, but your hair journey is just that, yours. You really don’t have to stick with anything that makes you unhappy. Life is too short for that! If having straight hair makes you happy and you know and you’re fine with what it entails, then go for it!"
Wertyasda,o98zv9,"It’s a shame to read it this, but do what’s comfortable for you. It’s your body."
backwithpics,o98zv9,"I totally get it. I’ve been feeling this way a lot recently too. But I have so much guilt, like I’m almost going against my blackness by straightening my hair? My curls are while. Super tight and Knapp in the back and then super loose curls in the front. I’d have to get it cut every four weeks just to keep them all the same length- but curly stylists in my area are booked months out. So ya anyways, I totally understandx"
ontariodwarf,o98zv9,"I agree with this! Life is too long to always be stressed about your hair (I say as someone who’s always stressed about hair lol)&&&I think you should do whatever makes you feel most comfortable with yourself. I also wear my hair in a bun most of the time either from a wash and go or twist out but part of me feels like I’m just waiting for my hair to be longer or nicer so I can feel better about it and wear it out. I just straightened my hair a few days ago. Since I started taking care of my natural hair I only straighten it about once every couple months and for a second I thought it would be better to just start wearing my hair straight again but then I remember how damaged it got and constantly worrying about humidity and wind and sweating. So for me, I know it’s like the grass is always greener on the other side.

It’s frustrating to feel like you’re taking care of your hair for no good reason - just to wear it up or just to wait for one day when it finally looks the way you want. But try to remember why you went natural in the first place and maybe think about some things you can do to try and feel more comfortable with your natural hair - try new products, get a haircut, try a protective style, etc. I’ll be doing the same when I wash out this silk press. I personally recommend botanicals and plant gels for your natural hair and my favorites at the moment are the Kinky Curly products and Uncle Funky’s Curly Magic. I also think that if wearing your hair straight is what you want and it works for you, then just do it. If you don’t want to wear your natural hair then you shouldn’t feel pressured to. Sometimes I’m like “it’s just hair” and what’s the point of taking care of it if I don’t enjoy how it looks so why not straighten, dye, cut it, whatever but then sometimes I’m like “just take care of it and do the most and one day you’ll figure it out” so I get that it’s hard to be in the position you’re at and it sucks to not feel good about the way you look. Just remember there are LOTS of things you can do to change up your look but if straightening is the one you want then that’s okay"
satanic_panic_90,o98zv9,I don’t feel pretty with my natural hair either. I hate trying to find a style that looks good and makes me feel good. Box braids are my go to. My hair can be waist length and different colors without damage.
tamoki30,o98zv9,"5 years is barely enough time to form a deep enough relationship with your natural hair. I went through the ""constant straightening” phase for 7 lol. Get it braided/ stick it under some half wigs/ headband wigs. Focus on just caring for it and keeping it hidden while it grows. It gets better and the results are SO WORTH IT!!!"
AshlandSouth,o9779v,Lovely
FreshfortheOccasion,o9779v,Well done! Beautiful hair! I’m learning to embrace my natural hair right now but some times it’s a struggle.
Sack_of_Sunshine,o9779v,I got super happy seeing my hair fresh out the shower I'm super proud of the work I've put in to learning how to do and take care of my hair&&&&&&Thank you!!!!
rnountdiablo,o9779v,Girl YOU'RE SO PRETTY
BeautyOfaWolf,o96jgj,"3b-3c & possible 4a looks like. Same happened to me. No more heat, including blow drying! Wash as often as your hair feels like it! My curls loved water before I locked my hair & it loves it even more now! Use all natural products. Try to avoid commercial products at all costs! Most have harmful chemicals even if they claim to be ""organic and natural"".. look up & research every ingredient! You'll thank yourself later! What I do is wash with raw African black soap, use black Jamaican castor oil to moisturize or avocado oil, rosemary oil, sage oil, lavendar oil, tea tree oil, sage oil, jojoba oil all have amazing effects! Mix your own oils together if needed. Refresh your curls with an herbal spritz or rose water everyday & voila! Took about 5 years for my full curl pattern to come back after about 15 years of perms!! I now make my own hair products for my hair and my family's hair. & Our hair had never been healthier! Blessings to you on your way back to your natural divine state! 🙏 also get u can get a fresh aloe vera leaf, cut the aloe out & use it to make a leave in conditioner!! Blend with water & essential oils! Make sure u refrigerate so it won't go bad!"
KEnyinna,o96jgj,Thin 3b hair
MistressRose_f33t,o96jgj,What is my hair type? I’m trying to recover my hair from perms when I was younger and need hair growth tips and product suggestions etc but don’t even know my hair type.. I went my whole life thinking I have 4C what do you think ?&&&
RipredTheGnawer,o96jgj,"Regular washing, detangling, shampoo and conditioner should restore your hair as long as you moisturize well afterwards. Btw, you look great to me as is tbh"
Wertyasda,o96jgj,3C (could even be considered 3B) at the front gradually going onto 4A at the back.
googoobeebee,o94xdc,I wear my natural hair straight most of the time and I haven’t experienced any heat damage. I have fine type 4 hair and I get the best results when I use a setting/ wrapping foam to blow out my hair first. I use the BB foam wrapping lotion and it does a great job of adding moisture and setting my hair straight. It’s so lightweight I can be heavy handed with it to detangle and moisturize before the blow out. I usually use a lightweight serum just before flat ironing as well to keep products to a min.
hanap8127,o94xdc,"Thats a great idea! Ive only ever used the foam to do a roller set.&&&If you live in a place with high humidity, you might just have to accept the frizz. Maybe use flexirods to refresh instead of the flat iron. It’ll add some shape and help to camouflage the frizz. 

My process:
1. Clarify twice to remove all product buildup, dirt, and oil. You don’t want to cook those things into your hair. 
2. Olaplex shampoo and conditioner 
3. Blow dry spray. I don’t use a leave in because it seems to make my hair frizzier. 
4. Blow dry. Ive heard it will be less poofy/frizzy if you do this step the night before, so I put my hair up overnight. I use a revair and it has sped up the flat ironing process so much. I also don’t struggle with curly roots since I’ve invested in this dryer. 
5. Heat protectant spray. 
6. Flat iron on the lowest temp that straightens my hair. 370ish. One pass. I usually do a flat iron curl instead of flat ironing it straight. Again, striving for perfectly straight ends up in disappointment and damage. 
7. Pin curl each curl and leave up for a couple of hours. I’m trying out this step and my hair comes out a lot smoother."
happyhippoking,o94xdc,"I start with a good deep conditioner to add as much moisture as possible, because I don't use any product except heat protectant. My hair is dense and coarse so too much added product makes it stiff with no movement.

High heat blowdryer and a paddle brush, then follow-up with a flat iron at 400F to 425F. I part small sections with a rattail comb, then do the chase method with the fine tooth rattail comb. I do two passes. Finish with oil sheen. To preserve, I wrap my hair at night. I can get two weeks usually. If my style starts getting frizzy or puffy, I'll braid it and rock loose waves."
ontariodwarf,o94xdc,"How do you do your silk press?&&&I just flat ironed my hair and I kind of regret it because it’s still fluffy and frizzy and I feel like I wasted my time 😓

How do you straighten/flat iron/silk press? I think its best to not use a lot of products but I’m scared of damage (I used to flat iron my hair so often and I’m just now experiencing healthy natural hair for the first time) so I still use a water-based leave in, blow out spray and serum before I flat iron and then I’ll use hairspray and/or serum for retouching. I know I shouldn’t flat iron it during the week but it gets frizzy so fast!! Part of me feels like if I didn’t use the leave in but then didn’t have to retouch it would be the same “damage” as using a leave-in and having to retouch but idk. 

I use 180 pro miracle damage eliminator bc it has a lot of heat protectant ingredients in it and Ogx silk blowout spray before blow drying and some combination of Eva NCY 10 in 1 primer and chi silk infusion before flat ironing. My hair feels really soft but is fluffy and gets frizzy at the slightest humidity and it doesn’t really hold a style (curls or curled ends). It’s not very flowy but these are things where I don’t know if that’s just how my hair is or if I’m doing something wrong/could be doing something better. I’ve never bothered with the hair typing thing but most would probably say 3c-4b if that helps 

Any tips or recommendations for a better silk press?&&&Thank you! That might be another thing I’m doing wrong - I use 340-360F on the flat iron bc again, scared of damage. Do you find that 400-450 is fine for you or do you notice any changes to the health of your hair? I also do small parts and the chase method with a fine-toothed comb or sometimes a boar bristle brush

Can I also ask what heat protectant you use?&&&Thanks! I might try something like this"
stealthpursesnatch,o94xdc,"Pretty much the same expect 450 degrees on the flat iron and only one pass using the chase method. Oh, I also do three passes at the roots to get them straight. I don’t do any touching up. 

I deep condition weekly and keep my hair moisturized so that it is in good shape before flat ironing. And I use some sort of protein on my hair before applying heat."

Crunchy_Spicy_Water,o92is2,What do you say exactly when you give a compliment? That makes a difference.
Disastrous_Flower667,o92is2,"That makes sense and that’s fine. If someone volunteers that it’s not their hair they already aren’t concerned who knows about it.&&&I have more hairstyles than an entertainer, sometimes it’s my hair sometimes I bought it from the beauty supply and in the winter it’s a drawstring wig from Amazon. Either way, I would take zero offense to your compliment and I’d probably reply with, “I got it on Amazon.” However, I’m as proud of my hair collection as I am of my degrees and it all belongs to me so I often joke that it is “my” hair because possession is 9/10’s of the law and the hair is with me right now."
Future_Mrs_Some1,o92is2,Everyone has given you feedback on your question. I just wanted to say thanks for lifting other women up and sharing some love 🫂
OMGSafeword,o92is2,Seconded! Some people respond with “it’s not mine” BECAUSE of how often they get harped on from other folks unfortunately
Terracrush,o92is2,"This would give me a chuckle, I think you're fine :)"
ezioauditoresexslave,o92is2,"No need to be so extra with it; just say “oh, well it looks fantastic either way!”"
hellurrfromhere,o92is2,"Hope this is allowed— I have a strange question&&&So I love natural hair, and I don’t have it myself. I am white, f, 26. But I always make a point to compliment others as much as possible.

So to get to the point, when I compliment those with natural hair who have weave/extensions/etc (I don’t know all of the technical names, sorry) I have heard this response often: “oh it’s not mine.” And I usually respond with: “well it’s on your hair, so I think it counts as yours!” 

And basically I want to know if that is rude to say? I know it’s a weird question but I think of it as being polite. At least I mean it that way. And I know there’s sort of a stigma when it comes to all hair types that says: “if you have extensions/etc then oh it’s not your real hair” but I think that’s so stupid. As someone who has very fine hair, I have always wanted extensions and hated when people try to essentially degrade others by saying “oh they have fake hair”. 

Hopefully that all made sense. 

Thanks I’m advance.&&&Great idea! Thank you. Someone else mentioned this sort of thing and idk why I hadn’t thought of it that way. But maybe the response about it’s being theirs is more of my own insecurities which I’m projecting bc of things I have heard others say. Which also isn’t cool haha&&&Okay. Thank you! I just never wanna come across like I’m being rude when I mean it the opposite way lol&&&Thank you hehe 🥰&&&Ahhhhh good idea. Sometimes saying less=more. I have a hard time with that social concept haha 🤦🏻‍♀️&&&Thank YOU 🥺 that makes me feel so good.&&&Ahhhh that is a great point, I never even thought of it that way.&&&I say “I love your hair so much! That’s beautiful!” And then when they say “oh thanks, but it isn’t mine” I say “well it’s on your head, so I think it’s yours!” And then sometimes follow up again with what I like about it. Does that make sense?&&&That’s exactly how I feel! If you own it, and you wear it, it’s yours! Thank you for your comment. I just don’t ever want people feeling like because it didn’t grow on their head, it’s somehow less of theirs."
noelle588,o92is2,Just say something to the effect of “well it looks fabulous/looks great on you”. That way the compliment is given and received the right way
rahrah_2,o92is2,I personally think what you're saying is good
Lavi1114,o8uh31,"4 Months Since My Big Chop and I’m amazed at how much your curl pattern can change overtime&&&&&&Moral of the story: stay away from all chemicals. I’ve been natural my whole life and had thick 3b/c hair. After I bleached it my natural hair was growing straight. I assumed the my curls were weighting it down. My oils would be too oily for my new hair but not enough for my ends. After 2 years of struggling with dyed hair, I made the choice to cut it off. Finally realized my hair texture has completely changed (much more thinner and a lot more likely for breakage) and my old products do not work. I’m still learning how to take care of it and trying new things."
cottonmouth94,o8nww2,Beautiful and cute outfit!

AlextehAuthor,o8nuqw,I know it's not the most important thing to know your hair type but I'm still curious. What do you guys think mine is? I was thinking mostly 4a.&&&
DoubllW,o8lcpn,"Hair growth questions&&&!HAIR GROWTH QUESTIONS!
1. For those who didnt notice any hair growth before, did you notice your hair start to retain length once you started trimming your ends?
2. What is your hair porosity and do you use coconut oil? If so how do you use it?
3. What natural hair styles help you retain length? And how do you do the style that helps?
4. What vitamins have worked best for you if you take any?
5. Do you massage your hair frequently? If so, did you notice a growth difference? And how do you massage it? (Like if you apply any oils to your fingertips or use a massage instrument, etc.)

!WASH AND GO QUESTIONS!
1. Whats your wash and go routine and what products do you use?
2. How do you stretch your wash and go?
3. Whats your hair length and how do you tie up your wash and go for night time?
4. How do you refresh your curls in the morning or when they begin to look tired out?"
ontariodwarf,o8lcpn,"1. I don’t notice more growth with trimming. I think my hair is fuller in the crown bc this is where I get the most breakage so trimming more regularly I think has helped curb the breakage but it doesn’t grow any faster 
2. My hair porosity changes a lot. I have some damage so sometimes if I’m not doing the right thing it seems high porosity but when I started using certain products it seems lower most of the time. Idk if porosity affects how shiny your hair is but my hair is never really shiny so I’ve interpreted that as a rougher cuticle/higher porosity 
3. I only wear my hair in twists, twist outs and wash & gos. People say twists are good for length retention but I haven’t noticed on myself  

5. Skipping 4 bc I’ve never taken hair vitamins. I used to massage before every wash and it helps with exfoliation but didn’t affect growth as far as I could tell. I quit doing it and now I just use a shampoo brush in the shower and my scalp is still clean and not flaky 

Wash & go 
1. For wash & go, I shampoo, (deep, sometimes) condition, and detangle like normal then apply either Uncle Funky’s curl Magic to soaking wet hair, rake/massage in then top with The Doux mousse or I’ll use kinky curly knot today on damp hair, wet my hair with water then apply the curly custard on top and rake/massage in
2. I don’t stretch
3. Shoulder length when stretched. I flip my head upside down and tie my hair into a loose pineapple with a scarf then put a bonnet on top to sleep
4. I don’t refresh! I wear the wash & go for a few days then I do my wash day again"
LadyTK,o8kimm,Soft locs vs Butterfly Locs&&&What’s the difference between the two? I’ve asked a stylist that provided each in service and she simply sent me pictures.

GrillMarks0,o8h9g9,I dunno if you can eliminate it but I'm a fan of a Biosilk Silk Therapy or Paul Mitchell Super Skinny. A small bit of either will tame the frizz for a week for me.
httpantwon,o8h9g9,What’s the best product for eliminating frizz on silk presses? (5 inch hair)&&&
CuppCake529,o8bitb,"I tend to use a leave in AND a gel with my Denman brush. Like I put the leave in in, detangle, separate into Denman section, gel, brush through with the Denman to style. It takes 30 minutes to do my whole head for hair that is longer than shoulder length and it stays for a good 4 days before I cowash again.

Also, for our hair, Running your fingers through your hair will break up curl clumps and create frizz."
DoubllW,o8bitb,"I use a leave in then go in with an oil, after the oil i put in a curl creme or curling better than use a gel or jelly (i dont know if mouses and serums would be able to hold curls like a gel or jelly) when i use my denman brush i do the same thing, but the difference is after i use the curl cream i then go in with the denman brush cause the brush makes my root frizzy when i use it after the gel. After brushing it i put the gel in. I dont know about brushing direction cause i never styled my hair short or cut it short. I put on a plastic bag when deep conditioning since i dont have a heat up cap. This just my routine for now i haven't completed it yet🙂"
ohemaa18,o8bitb,"In general, i would recommend that you start phasing out Shea moisture. The products are not well formulated and there are better products you can use for your hair. 

Second, when you wash, focus on incorporating a lot of water while you work in your conditioner. “Marrying” the water and conditioner will help with frizz. This will help smooth down the cuticles on the hair strand. 

A Denman brush is a tension brush so technically it’s best use is for blow drying but using any brush to style will only create artificial curls. If you’d like to capture your curls as they grow naturally, you should style it when it’s completely wet (so no drying after washing) using a botanical gel and/or texture foam. Some people use one product, some two. This depends on the climate you live in, how active you are, etc. Add water as you apply product. The hair should be completely saturated. Use your fingers to rake through small sections of the hair. Then set the hair with heat for best results (diffuser or hooded dryer).

The pinned post on this sub has resources that can help with styling. A virtual consultation with a stylist who can help you fine tune your routine and walk you through each step may be best."
s1jile,o8bitb,"Curl Routine Help (!!) - reduce frizz, add shine, how to use brush (text in comments!)&&&&&&Hello!  
I need some help identifying my curl pattern and what products I should be using. I've added some pictures below as examples. At the moment, I usually use Shea Moisture and As I Am products. I believe my hair is 4a. I am having trouble with styling and maintaining frizz. My usual routine is to wash with Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo or skip the wash and use As I Am Coconut CoWash, then condition with Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Conditioner, and then finish with a little Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave In. I brush my hair in the shower when it's still wet and then I'll wrap it in a t shirt for a couple of minutes and let it air dry. I will also use the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Masque once a week.  
As you can see from image 1, the curls are not like photos 2 and 3. Image 1 is how my hair naturally dries without any styling. I don't like it that way because it feels light, loose, and it falls awkwardly due to the length. It's also a lot more frizzy since the curls are thinner (?) so there are strands that kind of just stick out. I use a 7 row (D3?) Denman brush to create more defined thicker curls like in the first two pictures, but that is not how my hair naturally dries. My issue with using that brush is that it lumps my curls together and changes the pattern as you can see. I will use my fingers when my hair is wet to separate the curls so there are more individual curls. It may be because of the length of my hair that I am using the brush wrong because I can't really brush in a certain direction other than up and that takes so much hair in the brush resulting in clumped together curls.  
I'll probably get the color fixed after the summer, but until then, I am needing help with reducing frizz, especially after one night of sleep (I use a satin bonnet), adding shine (the ends are pretty dead and could use a trim), and figuring out how to brush my hair. Additionally, I don't know my hair porosity and I would like to figure that out as well! I would love to run my fingers through my hair without tangled knots and it feel soft and smooth!!!  
Thank you for any help!&&&What kind of oil do you use and what kind of gel? I actually decided to try brushing it down as if I had longer hair and things turned out way better. I ended up with something in between what I posted above. The curls ended up more uniform and in a 3c pattern but didn't clump up when I changed the direction of how I brushed. It was a huge surprise actually haha.&&&Thanks for your response! What is it about Shea Moisture that isn't good? I've only recently learned about working with natural hair and before Shea, I was using Devacurl, which I stopped using after everything came out about that company. Do you have a brand that you'd recommend? I prefer sticking to one brand for everything, but I'm open using different brands if that's what works best!

I think I made some discoveries the other day. The biggest issue for me was using the denman brush. I was brushing upwards as that was the only way I knew how to brush my hair. I thought because of the short length and the way it dries, I figured it should be brushed up. That's when I ran into issues with my curls clumping up. I used the denman brush recently and brushed it down as if I had longer hair, if that makes any sense. I was worried that it would mess up my curls by either laying flat and awkward or having them form into clumps again. Surprisingly, everything went well. I ended up with something in between the pictures I posted - like my curls weren't thin and as frizzy but they weren't clumped and in an unnatural pattern. It was actually quite nice when it dried. It was like I finally saw my curl pattern! 

 Any gel recommendations for frizzy hair? Thanks :))"
