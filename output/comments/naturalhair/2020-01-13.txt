irlrllynice,er8bof,"I imagine you just have a curl pattern that differs in places, and needs more time to define? A pic would help."
socialworksyd,er8bof,Straight pieces of hair&&&So I did The big chop. I shaved my head completely made sure there was no relaxed hair left. And now five months after I have a TWA but I have straight pieces of hair sticking out. It looks like they have absolutely no curl pattern at all! Is this normal is it bad how do I fix it?
Fairytaledreamz,er5w9o,Cantu makes an apple cider vinegar rinse that I use with my braids.
KlutzyVix,er5w9o,Looks like a reaction to the braiding hair to me. I would try rinsing it with an apple cider vinegar solution (1 part vinegar to 7 or 8 parts water) and then greasing the scalp with something light. Braiding hair is treated with a known scalp irritant that can cause this issue if the hair isn't soaked before use.
UrDadsFave,er5w9o,Grease or oil your scalp with a leave in conditioner. I use oyin handmade products. Used to be able to find them in Target but they are on Amazon now.
Waitwhatthatscrazy,er5w9o,Could it be that you‚Äôre allergic to the hair and it‚Äôs causing a reaction? Maybe you can try using some sort of cleanser (off hand thinking diluted tea tree oil) and then moisturizing.
nanobot11,er5w9o,"so many flakes and itchiness with box braids..NEED HELP&&&I have no idea what to do. I get these huge chunks of dandruff on my scalp, enough to make the parting look white. On top of that it's super itchy. Nothing seems to be working.. I need to keep these braids for at least another month. any suggestions??? (it looks worst in real life)

dizzyexplorer22,er5usb,What a cute texture on that twa!
haireveryshare,er5usb,Very cute! The short curls suit your face.
juniper_fox,er5usb,Looks so hydrated and I absolutely love the texture it gave you. You're totally slaying that twa =)
haireveryshare,eqgly8,"Shea moisture ‚Äúmake it last wash n go conditioner‚Äù. is the most potent conditioner I‚Äôve found in 17 years or.  

only complaint is it‚Äôs so thick it is *very* frustrating to get out of the bottle."

Ample-sauce,eqbvzi,Look into Grace Eleyae slap caps.
QueenLeo01,eqbvzi,Hair Bonnets&&&I seem to have the hardest time trying to find a good hair bonnet that doesn't stretch out or is too small even though they are labeled wide band. Can someone please help me wirh some suggestions???
Racine17,eqbvzi,"Try Etsy, a lot of people make and sell large to jumbo satin and silk bonnets there. I purchased one from this shop and so far I like it.  
https://etsy.me/2G1tzwr
It's big enough to keep my hair from being so smushed in the morning and it's adjustable so I don't have to worry about the headband part stretching out."
haireveryshare,eqbvzi,"You know, now that you mention it there is a great big market for truly high quality satin bonnets!  The tiny ones are a joke. Like What is this, just a bun cover? 

My wide band bonnet is stretched out but i just roll the band back into the satin, which shrinks it and actually ends up being gentler on my hairline.  This way only satin is in contact with my hair vs the rougher elastic."
livesarah,eqbvzi,I bought an adult sized one for my 5yo daughter and it just barely covers her head- in fact it is SMALLER than the kid-sized one I bought for my son. I‚Äôm following for some good suggestions because even my kids marvelled at how bad the most recent one is!

511lonette,eqbs3k,Sounds like you need a daily leave in conditioner or something else to moisturize.
Izzy248,eqbs3k,"Looking for hair advice: Do you think I should try hair detangler or a flat iron?&&&* So, for a little context, Ill include it in the paragraph below. If you dont want the context, you can skip the following paragraph:
   * So Im a guy and I grew up not particularly caring too much about my hair. I washed it every now and then but usually my mom, aunts, or grandmom would always braid it for me and thatd be it. That or itd just get shaven off into a very low cut so that nobody had to bother with it. Well, Im older now and I actually do care more about my hair. Another reason I never particularly cared about my hair in the past is because my mom and previous girlfriends always preferred Id keep my hair cut, so I never had much a reason to keep it growing beyond a certain length. Especially since I couldnt afford to go to places to get it done, nor did I know where to go, and who to ask. Basically, if my family wasnt willing to do it, I had no choice but to cut it. And since my mom especially didnt like my hair long, wasnt much of a choice. Now that thats no longer a factor and I can let it grow as I please, Ive been taking steps to keep my hair long and healthy. Although Im still ignorant to most stuff.
* For my following hair routine, this is what I usually do, at least, what seems to work for me, and from what Ive researched is good for my hair:
   * Im a type 4C/4D with Low Porosity
   * Every 2 weeks I wash my hair with a mix of Water and Braggs Raw and Unfiltered Organic Apple Cider Vinegar w/ the Mother (so I can rinse out any pollutants, or dirt, etc.)
   * Then I wash it out and condition it with something. I forget what I used before...it was some kind of conditioner with mango butter in it, but I feel like it wasnt actual mango butter...more like the essence of mango butter. But now Im using Teatree Mint Conditioner to help clean, smoothen, and give nutrients to my hair. I dont use shampoo since I use the ACV since I heard thats just redundant.
   * As Im doing this I use a wide tooth shower comb to detangle the ends
   * I have some Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave-In Condition that I mix with water and spray into my hair after Im done and out the shower, and massage that into my scalp.
   * Thats usually the gist of my routine
* Heres the thing:
   * My hair tends to curl up and tangle together kind of quickly. Doesnt help that I have to put it in a bun for work. I was wondering if maybe I should use some kind of detangler, like Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Detangler...although I wouldnt even know how to begin to use that. Or maybe if I flat iron my hair it would help keep it from knotting up so quickly.

&#x200B;

Any advice or suggestions is welcome. Like, do I actually need a detangler, would a detangler help, or does a flat iron actually help in this situation? Because there is another black guy at my job who also has his hair in a bun, and his hair is fairly straight. I feel like he flat irons his, but he also probably has a different hair type, so results vary. As well as if you think there is anything I should do to improve, or change my routine, that would also be welcome."

Epicrealist,eq5499,"I recently dyed my hair this gorgeous blue green color for the new year! Second time doing this color. Why do you guys think? üòãü•∞üëåüèæ&&&&&&Thanks! It usually lasts about 3 months before fading to a full green if you take care of it by using products specifically built for keeping colors vibrant. Those help, as well as deep conditioning.
I was magenta/pink prior to mine fading back to blonde! I loved it.&&&Thanks! ü§ó"
UrDadsFave,eq5499,This is dope. How does it age? I dyed my hair blue black but by the time it grew out it was a shade of green. I'm about to go blonde to candy pink ombre.
corgigirl97,eq4xyg,"Nape Issues&&&I am having issues on the left side of my nape. It allways tangles up and becomings super painful while the rest of my hair is perfectly fine. I get trims every 3 months and I sleep with a Satin Bonnet on every night. I even try to rotate which side I sleep on, but nothing seems to alleviate the pain. Does anyone have any tips?"
