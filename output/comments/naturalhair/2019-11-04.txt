CoffeeB4Talkie,dumjo3,"I always warm up  my conditioners, deep conditioners and leave ins. With My DC I apply it, put on my conditioning cap, apply my hair/towel turban and then put my bonnet on over it and let it sit for however long.

Also, when I apply my leave in, I put my conditioning cap back on and let it sit for 5-15 minutes. I have low porosity hair, and that helps it absorb."
Raeleenah,dumjo3,"Sounds like you might have low porosity hair? Good sign is it takes a long time for your hair to air dry.

Moisturize your hair with heat, that's the best advice i can give. Like maybe after moisturizing, throw on a plastic showercap and maybe even wrap your head in a towel on top to heat it up faster. 

If you don't want to do that then maybe immediately after rinsing your hair with hot to warm water, squeeze out the excess water and slather in your moisturizers while your hair still has the warmth of the water. Or use a blow dryer for a hot minute while the moisturizer is in your hair.

I'm not sure if it's a product meant for low porosity hair but Camille Rose's Honey leave in works wonders for my low porosity hair and my guy friend was obsessed with how soft his hair was after using a tiny bit once. It's a bit pricey though and might not be for you if you don't like the idea of your hair smelling like pancake syrup.

Edit: clarification"
SaintNottingham,dumjo3,"My hair is always extremely dry (M)&&&Since I started growing out my hair, it has always been dry. I have tried a plethora of products, but they all just seem to sit  on top of my hair instead of absorb into it. I have 4c hair and it is really frustrating. I don't care about how curly my hair looks honestly, I just want my hair to look and feel moisturized. What should I do to retain moisture and have healthy looking hair with my texture?"
jantheaquarian,dumjo3,Replying because I also have this problem and would like to know what to do
namasteplantbased,dumjo3,"Have you tried clarifying or detoxing for your hair. We often put so many products on our hair to find the key to moisture but in our search, we end up clogging our pores and preventing our hair from being moisturized. With oils, butters, and silicones we end up with strands that we are unsure of what they feel like naked or moisturized. I do a detox with [bentonite clay mask](https://www.healthyhuemans.com/healthy-beauty/2019/4/24/3-ways-to-use-bentonite-clay-for-low-porosity-hair) regularly and aim to use products that are water-soluble and easily washed away to ensure my hair can receive the moisture from my conditioner, botanical gels, and curl creams. I also did the 30 day hair detox and it changed the hair game for me."

Classyassgirl,dudrmf,"With the medications I'm on if I didn't use it I wouldn't keep my hair. Dilute it if you want to spray it everyday tho. 

I can pm you the link to a (expensive!) rice water conditioner I use that really helps. Smells but hey. It works."
CoffeeB4Talkie,dudrmf,It's a no for me (low porosity).
SleepieSheepie8,dudrmf,"I don‚Äôt think anything of it. The only thing that will grow your hair out is taking care of it and patience. Deep conditioning, keeping moisture in and great scalp care. That‚Äôs it. There is no universal miracle remedy. Rice water may add shine to your hair
and no doubt it has a lot of good nutrients. It‚Äôs nothing special though. You can get the same nutrients from other things too.

You just need to establish a good routine and keep at it. Healthy hair grows!"
cslrc,dudrmf,"I don't have experiences with rice water, but I'm curious why your hair is fragile, so I ask you some questions:

How long is your hair right now?

Do you have color damage?

How often do you use high heat on your hair (flat-iron, blow-outs)?

Do you air dry or do you dry with a diffuser?

Do you (wet) detangle with a brush or a wide-tooth comb?

Do your ends get lightened naturally without dyeing/bleaching? 

Do you have breakage all over your hair, or do you have patches that are extra prone to breakage?

Do you also have white dots and incomplete splits?

How is your skin and scalp? Do you have for example eczema, flakes, itchy scalp, any allergies or intolerances?"
librasunflow,dudrmf,"Thoughts on rice water? üëÄ&&&I‚Äôve been struggling growing out my hair. I do everything right but my hair breaks really easily and my ends always feel like trash so i have to cut my ends pretty often. I‚Äôve incorporated more protein based products into my hair to strengthen my hair but what do people think about rice water? Have you tried it? What were your results?&&&-my hair is like 2-3in past collarbone
-i may have color damage but i haven‚Äôt used permanent dye on my hair for maybe a year now.
-i never flat iron or blow out my hair
-i mostly air dry and use the diffuser if my hair isn‚Äôt dry by the morning
-i use a tangle teaser to detangle
- my ends don‚Äôt get lighter 
- i have visible breakage on the crown of my hair and some parts really close to my roots. i mostly notice the breakage while detangling.
-i‚Äôm not sure what white dots or incomplete splits are üò≠
-i‚Äôm blessed to not have any scalp problems. No dry or flaky scalp. I know i‚Äôm allergic to the TEA in ecostyler so i stay away from products with that ingredient.

Hope this helps you help me üò≠&&&i‚Äôd love that! thank you!"
shida206,dudrmf,May be too much protein... you may need more of a balance...maybe a deep conditioner with more moisture and a smidgen of protein... rice water is good for me... black rice is good... doesn't smell as bad as white rice water... but too much of anything is no good... maybe it time to go to a stylist for a consultation!
youngganddetermined,dudekj,"HELP!&&&So I only started learning about natural hair and how to care for it just over a year ago, and in that time my fro has flourished so much after years of mistreatment. I‚Äôve cut off many inches (I really wanted to avoid a BIG big chop but I knew my ends were trashed) and my hair is finally back to the same length and way healthier. Issue is I‚Äôm still struggling to figure out how to properly moisturize my hair.. I‚Äôm 4B/4C low porosity. Usually wear my hair in protective styles, where I just oil my scalp regularly and use a deep conditioning spray daily. I‚Äôve been letting my hair ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù for a little bit before I put it in braids again and I feel like I‚Äôm unsure about how to take care of it when it‚Äôs out. I know our hair type tends to feel dry but I‚Äôm always worried my hair still feels too dry. 

My wash routine: hot oil pre poo, shampoo twice (I only shampoo about once a month), conditioner, deep conditioner. Followed by applying leave in, curl cream, and my own oil mixture while still in the shower with soaking wet hair. Use mousse to do some loose twists afterwards. While I‚Äôm keeping my hair out I‚Äôll do 2 big twists and spray daily with water/deep conditioning spray, followed by oil or shea butter every couple days to lock in moisture. Not really sure when to apply my hair products again. I trim pretty regularly, the health of my hair is my top priority after years of mistreatment. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm doing everything I‚Äôm supposed to but I still feel my hair could be way more moisturized/softer. Am I just stressed over nothing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è"
UniquelyElle97,dubint,I have some curl milk that helps me. I heard co-washing is good too although I haven‚Äôt done that in a while.
adawkins94,dubint,"Keeping 4A/B Hair Moisturized Between Washes&&&*new naturalista so bear with me*

I‚Äôve been struggling to keep my low porosity strands moisturized between washes! I use the LCO method on wash day and that typically keeps my strands moisturized for 2-3 days; however, after that, my coils get very dry and brittle. I have very fine hair so I try to manipulate it as little as possible when it‚Äôs dry to prevent breakage...but I wonder if NOT moisturizing it between washes is leading to even more breakage and split ends. 

Thoughts? How do you all re-moisturize your hair and what products do you use? Do you wet your hair with water and use the LCO/LOC method between washes? If you do wet your hair between washes, do you also detangle before or after? 

Thanks in advance!"
because_pineapples,dubint,"I also have low porosity hair and I found that the leave in conditioner step is the key for me to retain moisture. The better the leave in conditioner, the longer you can go in between washes. With low porosity, once the cuticle closes whatever is in your hair is pretty much locked in, so if you use a good leave in you should be good until you want to wash again. I apply everything in the shower while my hair is soaking wet and warm, and this has given me the best results. 

I also find that letting my hair catch the steam when I shower daily is also nice for keeping it moisturized and refreshed. I don't add any product between washes because the low porosity would just make it sit on top of my hair unless I want to rewet it (and I don't have time or patience for that especially now that it's cold). I cowash once a week and shampoo every few weeks or so when it feels like there's product build up. I like to go as long as possible between shampoos to keep the moisture level as high as possible. I use the LCO method but I don't typically put the oil in my hair until it's about halfway dry."

iluvwater40,du0z4x,"Any pictures to go along with it? 
I feel like we have similar hair. What works for me is when washing, leaving most of the conditioner in. Makes sure your hair is dipping wet, at least in the roots. You need to hear that *squishy* wet sound at the roots when you scrunch. I do it upside down or side to side. And I only use gel. One type of gel. Kinky curly gel works best for me. Scrunch that gel in especially at the roots. But not too much. Too much touching gives me that poofy look. Idk if any of this helps."
trendynurse95,du0z4x,"Poofy thick Roots&&&I need some advice. After taking a quiz and doing some comparing to various hair typing charts I THINK I'm mostly 3c. But my hair SUCKS at doing anything other than frizzing up and being poofy. It takes a ton of product for my hair to be remotely defined with wash n gos ect and I'm still not getting any good definition imo. My hair at the roots has absolutely close to 0 definition, doesnt curl up hardly and doesnt really lay flat and it sucks cause my ends look very uniform and curly and my roots are mostly poofy with a little definition here and there. I do have very thick and coarse, hair ever since I can remember.  I think I do a great job at keeping it moisturized even though it sucks up all the product lol. My mother has always told me that I have had very thick hair that has always liked to stay pretty much straight since I was an infant. So maybe it's just how my hair is naturally? Which is soooooo depressing ü§£  braid outs, red sets do really good with my hair which has a nice texture overall. Also, I know that race generally can only say so much about a person's hair but I am mixed. My siblings hair is just so much curlier than mine and I dont understand why lol. Any advice on products or  methods that could help with my definition? Is there anything that can be done? I've been doing trial and error for YEARS and have yet to find a solution.  I dont hate my hair, I love it so much and take really good care of it I just wish I had some good definition and less poofyness"

Blergh_MaGerks,dthh01,"Also, were the locs made with kanekalon hair? If it was and they weren't soaked in ACV first, you might be having an allergic reaction as well as it being too tight.

RedBeans-n-Ricely,dthh01,"Try ACV. They might be too tight, if you don‚Äôt want to mess with the braids, at least try some ibuprofen or Aleve for that pain!"
Riversongbluebox,dthh01,I agree with everyone in the thread. I have used apple cider vinegar rinse with all protective styling and its a godsend for the scalp.
chocolatequickk,dthh01,Sulfur 8 grease
luckyseaturtle,dthh01,They‚Äôre either too tight or the chemicals in the hair are irritating your scalp. Could be a combination of both. I agree with other users: spray some ACV and water on them to help‚Äùrinse‚Äù them. My mom would have me dab my scalp with a cotton soaked in witch hazel. It helps for temporary relief.
