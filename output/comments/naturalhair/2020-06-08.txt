Urfavorganiccheeto,h9873l,"Making a hair growth concoction w ingredients from hair loss study&&&Hey there all. So ya girl is still desperate for them inches lol. So I was doing some research on triggering hair growth (the anagen phase) using caffeine & panax ginseng (korean red ginseng) because I already knew it was good for hair growth but just love to read up on new scientific studies on hair growth. I was especially interested in the caffeine + panax ginseng because its in a product I was thinking of buying (Mark Anthony Grow Long Leave in Conditioner) and was reading the reviews on it and it seems like ppl get good results with it and I saw that one reviewer said that it made their hair grow four (4) inches in 3 months using it & I just knew it was time to use this caffeine & panax ginseng combo... lol. I have known for awhile now that caffeine is good for fast hair growth but wasn't able to use it because I had became sensitive to caffeine for awhile due to my adrenals being burnt out but now I can consume it again bc I have fixed it with holistic care so now I am going to be using caffeine again along with some other things to try to promote hair growth that is mentioned in the hair loss study.

Some of the ingredients they mentioned in the study are:

Garlic (sulfer)

The tea plant (caffeine. Speeds up hair growth, helps shedding, helps hair loss/baldness from androgen induced alopecia by blocking dht)

Cayenne (promotes blood circulation to the hair follicles)

Panax ginseng (good for scalp circulation & has flavinoids that help increase hair growth)

Rosemary (scalp circulation)

There were a couple of other herbs talked about in that study too & you can read it in the link below

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7013965/

Anyways, I plan on making a hair growth mixture (probably waterbased) with caffeine powder, panax ginseng to try to use as a leave in growth aide to massage my scalp with then use another concoction on my wash days with black rice water, cayenne pepper powder, rosemary oil, and sublimed sulfer powder mixed in with a PROTEIN FREE conditioner to use as a hair growth mask to massage on my scalp and let sit on my hair for about 30mins-1 hour (will probably sit under my hooded hair dryer some for the heat which generates blood circulation the scalp), rinse, then follow up with cowashing (sublimed sulfer smells like rotten egg farts if that makes sense lol) to get any excess particles out like the sublimed sulfer or cayenne powder then do a moisturizing deep conditioner (PROTEIN FREE) afterwards to make sure hair is properly hydrated after using that black rice water. I just wanted to share my findings and hope I get good hair growth :)&&&I got too carried away with my hair condish recipe lol. Yes, I will let you know if theres any growth if I can remember lol. Isn't there a way to have reddit remind you or something? Lemme see if this works lol #remindmein30days&&&Hi! Yes, I am just thinking of waterbased since making the type of concoction I want to make would take like 2 weeks of steeping to really be effective lol. Last night I made a hair growth conditioner with silicone free & protein free conditioner as base, one teaspoon of sublimed sulfer, 15 drops rosemary eo, 10 drops peppermint eo, veggie glycerin, castor oil, safflower oil, jojoba oil, some liquid panax gingseng, and before I added any of the above ingredients I used a ceramic soup bowl and put in thai black rice (1 tablespoon) and fenugreek seeds (1 teaspoon) and covered with just enough water accounting for water absorption and heated for 3:30secs in the microwave, let cool for a bit then strained the rice & fenugreek and added all the other ingredients and mixed well applied to hair then massaged my scalp with it throughly and left in hair for 30mins. This morning the roots of my hair looked a bit thicker which is great results and got a tiny bit of growth overnight because of all the stimulating ingredients and hope to do this mixture again. Next time I will add in caffeine and see how my hair reacts.&&&When I did this mixture with the rice water, scalp massage & a diy blend of hair grease with sulfer & kept my hair in twists/braids or covered under a hair wrap I was getting like 1 inch a month. Unfortunately I fell into another depression slump so I havent used this mixture since the summer :(

Edited for clarification"
justht,h9873l,Interesting. Seems a good idea to go water based if possible. I look forward to hearing about your results. Will you update after a month or two?
mimi_234,h9873l,Is there an update?
Olevrean,h95zcz,"They're clip ins, you would wear them long term?"
cet050490,h95zcz,So pretty! Where did you get yours??
empressmarina7,h95zcz,Pretty
loaferette,h95zcz,Natural Clip ins anyone? ü§óü§óü§ó&&&&&&Her textured hair&&&A couple minutes.
sopreshous,h95zcz,"My mom just started trying this. They‚Äôre nice. She clips them in and wear them to work, 8 plus hours, and errands. She takes it out before laying down. Takes her about 20 or so minutes to put them in. Honestly a very easy and versatile way to wear your hair."
tamoki30,h95zcz,How long does an install last?
CoffeeB4Talkie,h953en,"How do YOU feel about the cut? That's all that really matters. üòä

I bet you look great."
YoGirlLexii,h953en,This is how much hair I cut off. My mom was complaining lol.&&&
jessdaye212,h953en,Good for you. It looks split and damaged! I hope you got the look you desired!
Buttercream_Brat,h952tv,"Yes queen!!!!! You look gorgeous! Healthy hair, healthy soul! Love love love!!!!"
YoGirlLexii,h952tv,"I decided to cut my hair because of bad split ends annnd my hair started to look ""invisible"". Idk I'd that makes sense lol. But I think it looks better ‚ô•Ô∏è&&&"
KekeAse,h935kx,Hawaiian Silky 14 in 1? Thoughts?&&&Hiiii I wanted to know other people‚Äôs experience with Hawaiin Silky 14 in 1. I have 4c low porosity hair so I wanted to know if you guys would consider this a good moisturizer? (:&&&Really? What texture is your hair?
mixedish,h935kx,i love this!
AJG4222,h9302r,I just bought a variety of products & can't wait to mix them! üíÉüèΩ
CoffeeB4Talkie,h9302r,What's in each bottle?
ellen_water-melanin,h9302r,"Spray Bottle Sunday. Letting the ingredients sit before adding the water.&&&&&&The base is always the same: coconut oil and conditioner. The conditioner I‚Äôve been using is the cream of nature intensive conditioning treatment. (Amazing)

Then after that it‚Äôs:
‚Ä¢Hair food products:  one has the beeswax the other has the olive oil
‚Ä¢ Cream of Nature coconut milk moisture curl
‚Ä¢ wild growth hair oil
‚Ä¢ Jamaican black castor oil
‚Ä¢olive oil
‚Ä¢vitamin E oil
‚Ä¢Tea Tree Oil
‚Ä¢ Jojoba Oil 
Then  whatever oils you want to add. The blue bottle that person wanted hemp oil, another argan oil, and something else I can‚Äôt remember 
‚Ä¢the person for the purple bottle wanted witch hazel and Mielle Rosemary mint strengthen oil in there"
hardoutheretobunique,h90u1g,"Care for protective braids/twists&&&I‚Äôm getting better but still learning. How do I maintain my daughters protective style? She has a satin pillowcase but usually ends up sleeping on the sheet instead of her pillow. Do I moisturize her scalp/roots? The braided hair? Is it ok to style hair while wet after a bath? It pulls less when it‚Äôs wet and slippery from the leave in. Thanks!&&&Thank you! Do I moisturize the braid every couple days like I would the scalp? If so, what‚Äôs the best way?&&&Thank you so much. I wasn‚Äôt sure how much and how little to tend to her hair. With  school coming on, I decided some nice, long lasting protective styles need to be learnt quickly."
purplemoonchild06,h90u1g,"It would probably be best to get her a bonnet. Moisturize the braid, and oil the scalp. Also it‚Äôs better to style when damp, not soaking wet&&&My hair gets dry quick so I moisturize either everyday or every other day, find out what works for your daughters hair. I use the lco method if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking"
Babycakes_99,h8zfg3,"Cry‚Äôn, girl. That‚Äôs the only way. 
My eyes get red and sore no matter what from the shampoo. 
The tears flow... so does the leave in. Right into my eyes. 

Hair looks good tho"
CoffeeB4Talkie,h8zfg3,I just dealt by chopping my hair off today. Lol
MrsSpock01,h8zfg3,Wash day done. How do you deal with wash day stress?&&&&&&This made me laugh out loud. I totally get it and I do the same most of the time.&&&Lol I've considered doing just that when I leave my hair in a puff for far too long.&&&Sounds so chill.&&&I wish I looked forward to wash day.&&&Thanks.&&&Lmao. Sorry and thanks for the compliment.&&&Thank you.
Olevrean,h8zfg3,I honestly can't keep my hair out of water. Wash day is no different than any other regular day

deniseloc,h8zfg3,Nice and juicy twists
dolphinne,h8zfg3,Awww you look so cute üò≠
justht,h8zfg3,"I enjoy checking out the results, then I just chill after. I do something fun or easy chores like laundry. Usually I watch movies, listen to music, and/or play a game, while I air dry."
kiskadee321,h8zfg3,By procrastinating for another week if I can. smh
lilliana41,h8zfg3,I third this. My arms often just don't have the strength.
mooshu1x2,h8zfg3,"I turn my wash day into a self-care day. Watch a movie, wash my hair, apply face mask, etc. I look forward to wash day!"
mysterious_igneous,h8zfg3,I had my wash day today and I took so many breaks. It was crazy. Typically I do it all without stopping but I was sooo unmotivated!!
shibbieee,h8zfg3,"I def need some form of entertainment: documentary, podcast, show , movie in the background and tell myself it's my me time."
showraniy,h8zfg3,"Ugh this is me. The next week tangles are way worse too, so I get punished for putting it off, lol."
SoberingReality,h8tp1y,It's lovely. How do you normally wear it day-to-day?
dolphinne,h8tp1y,I forgot it's been 3 months since I cut my hair whoops ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø&&&&&&I guess I'll cosplay as Huey from the Boondocks once my fro gets bigger?&&&omg ty! I just wear it in mini twists so I won't have to mess with it at all but I wear it as a fro a day or two before washing!&&&Lucky... What's your secret??? üëÄüëÄüëÄ
spicegrl1,h8tp1y,I don't cut mine anymore at all...but I never get split ends.
Sam-0808,h8omdm,Totally normal. Happens to me too
keepingholdtillmay,h8omdm,I also have this same issue. Does anyone have any suggestions?
poke-xo,h8omdm,"My hair gets dry the next day if I don‚Äôt twist it. Is this normal?&&&When I moisturize and twist up my hair it stays moisturized for 4 days. However, if I moisturize and wear my hair down it feels dry by the next day. Is this normal?"
Arene_o,h8m79p,"Your hair is really beautiful, your skin is glowing, your smile, your skin, everything is perfect."
Buttercream_Brat,h8m79p,"You are gorgeous, not matter how you wear your hair!!!! Love it!!"
Khunte99,h8m79p,I feel that. I have to wash my hair weekly. It takes me 2 days to do my hair on top of studying and working. It‚Äôs a lot lol so I feel you on that statement üíØ
Nieka876,h8m79p,So I got my hair done today lol. I only wear my natural hair 1-2weeks. I live in braids lol.

Not-Yet-Cinnamon-Bun,h8m79p,That shine tho-- beautiful! üëå‚ù§
Pikachu42,h8m79p,I feel this on a spiritual level! I'm waiting for things to calm down even more and then plan on getting my hair braids. My plan is to leave them in for 2 months (washing every two weeks) and then leave them out for a month.
UrDadsFave,h8m79p,Very pretty. You. The hair. Issa win.
blaquebeauty15,h8m79p,Same! I would honestly need an extra 2 hours in the morning daily if it weren't for braids
blottings,h8m79p,"Yep, I basically take my braids out, wash/dry my hair, and then braid my hair again the same day lol. Braids are so much easier to maintain. I love your hair!"
brasscokingship,h8m79p,"your hair,skin,lips all glistening plus your eyes all the more remarkably beautiful.."
empressmarina7,h8m79p,Its so true natural hair is time consuming. Thats why i usually wear my in a bun. Easiest thing for me to do. I never tried braids in my life but want to do this same style. I think  you would look cute with hair jewlery as well.
personwriter,h8m79p,"Lovely! 

Trust me, I understand. I live in twists and hats and scarves. Don't care what anyone thinks. People ask me why are you always wearing baseball caps? And, I'm like do you ask dudes the same question, lol?  There are guys everywhere who live in hats all day err'y day. 

Your hair is beautiful!"
princesajojo,h8m79p,It's a lot of work for sure. I lived in a sewin for almost 2 years (only stopped because of covid) because of the time it takes. You look gorgeous!
