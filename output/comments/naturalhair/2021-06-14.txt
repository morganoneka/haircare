Ariston_boss14,o4k2fb,I think her hair is 4a or 3c/4a
Ok_Acanthisitta_9092,o4k2fb,hi!! so in an earlier post of mine I asked for advice on how to care for my foster kids‚Äô natural hair. some asked for a photo so here is the girls hair as wet as I could get it today (she does not really like water!) any ideas as to what type her hair is? what products may work best? thanks!!&&&&&&Thank you so so much!!! This is super helpful! I have hard a hard time keeping her curls looking like this once her hair is dry. I‚Äôm going to try your method out the next time we wash her hair. Thank you again!!
elenadutch,o4k2fb,"Hey! Thanks for asking!, as a black daughter from a white mom, this is a great question!  First thing is find a fun way to get her to tolerate water because that‚Äôs the most useful product. Once you‚Äôre able to keep her head under that faucet, shower head, or stream, brush* (not comb) from the ends up with conditioner in* after shampooing. If you use enough of the conditioner that is already oil infused, you should be able to brush through her^ hair or detangle  with no problem. The water must be warm, it must be a brush, you need to condition liberally. When rinsing after 2-3 minutes, nail scrub the scalp, and run your fingers through to the ends. Repeat, repeat until it is Almost*** rinsed out. Leave a tadddd in as long as the scalp has been thoroughly rinsed (so no dandruff). Now invest in a few ‚Äúleave in‚Äùs to repeat the conditioning process. If you apply a good leave in while the hair is still wet (not dripping), you should be able to again, run your fingers through her hair (slow and gently)*Or have an easier time detangling . Now if your brush used in the shower already worked, this will be awesome, just brush from the ends working up to the root again. The curls formed immediately after brushing should stay if you used enough leave in* it will be a similar result with gel, without the hardness. Any Garnier sulphate free will help. Best leave in is Garnier 
Whole blends almond+ Argan or butter cream with coconut, jojoba,macadamia. I hope it works out! Goodlucküíñ & her hair is already beautiful! If you struggle getting her to tolerate the water just keep embracing her beauty and natural self in her own skin. that‚Äôs the best thing you could possibly do‚ù£Ô∏èdon‚Äôt give into wanting to straightenüòú"
Electronic_Creme2350,o4ih0q,"I just recently started wanting to care for my hair. The reason I‚Äôm looking to care got my hair is I don‚Äôt know how to make it grow. I want healthy hair that doesn‚Äôt break, but don‚Äôt know what to use for it. I want a lot of growth (like a large Afro) so I can style it how I want. What should I do?&&&&&&Okay! After that what brands and stuff should I put in my hair? And how often?&&&Okay cool. Do you suggest any products I should use? Like what kindof shampoo and conditioner? What does moisture and style mean? Like put it in braids and stuff?&&&Thank you for this, this is very detailed. I have low porosity hair, so i have a few more questions because I want to get on a daily/weekly routine. How often should I be putting oils, shampoo, and conditioner in my hair? After I deep condition my hair what should I put in it after?&&&Okay gotcha. So when I get in the shower I only do something to my hair once at week? I use a styling product everyday?"
PrettySimpleGuy,o4ih0q,Don‚Äôt over groom. I used to pick my hair out daily when I first started but eventually when I started caring for my hair I started finger grooming (just de tangling with fingers) and only picking my hair on wash days or when I was getting a style. Along with simple things like Jamaican castor oil. As far as brands I recommend AsIAm or taliah waajid
Understanding_Naive,o4ih0q,You might need to start with a trim to get rid of the split ends.
Viebee431,o4ih0q,"I suggest building a simple routine and then you can add onto that depending on your needs. Here‚Äôs an example: 
1. Shampoo and condition weekly, deep condition 2x a month (detangle during this step)
2. Moisturize and style 
3. At night, wrap hair with a satin or silk scarf, bonnet, or durag. (I also like having a satin or silk pillowcase since my scarf always falls off lol) 
4. Get trims when necessary (I trim my hair 2x a year)"
hanap8127,o4ih0q,Your hair will grow no matter what. Focus on a health scalp by shampooing and conditioning weekly.
joiejojojo,o4ih0q,"From a professional I follow on Twitter:
-Shampoo and condition OFTEN (at least once a week). Go for products that say moisturizing on them.
-Use ONE styling product (gel OR wrap foam) on wet hair
-Get trims on time.
-NO OIL. It dries out the hair by preventing moisture from the environment entering the hair shaft. 
-Cover hair at night.

Hair grows naturally no matter what you do to it unless you have a health issue or your scalp is damaged in some ways. There's no way to rush it or slow it down. Just be patient and enjoy the journey at all stages"
petit_pimento,o4ih0q,"I would check the porosity of your hair, meaning how much moisture enters the hair shaft through the cuticles. . If you have low porosity hair then all the oil you put it is not gonna penetrate the hair shaft and sit on your head making it greasy attract dirt and not grow. Take a strand and drop it in some water. If it sinks it‚Äôs high porosity. If it floats it‚Äôs low porosity and I‚Äôd it‚Äôs in the middle it‚Äôs normal. This determines if you need a clarifying shampoo to get read of the excess oil, use of heavier or lighter oils in between washes and hot oil treatments etc. 

Castor oil thickens the hair and encourages growth and anything to stimulate the scalp like a head massage and use of essential oils like peppermint Can help

Also water is a moisturizer, oil is a sealant. Putting oil on dry hair without any type of moisture is not going to do anything good for your hair"
PrettyNkicks,o4i9k9,Keeping it simple&&&
Impossible_Natural89,o4hr19,"ACV rinse for faux locs&&&Okay so, I rinsed my faux locs with ACV before having them installed and I‚Äôm still suffering from irritation, am I the only one that ACV doesn‚Äôt seem to work for? Any other tips or is fake hair just never gonna work for me. üò©"
tellofshinystars,o4hr19,"When I got faux locs for the first time, the itch was unbearable. And doing an ACV rinse with them already installed only worsened the itch. So now, every time I get them (I do crochet), I soak the hair in ACV before getting them installed. 

So the next time you get a style with synthetic hair, grab a large bowl or tuber ware container and fill it with warm water/ACV and place the hair in there for 20 minutes. And let it air dry. The hair is gross from being in a warehouse and has so much grime on it, so it's always good to pre-wash before installing."
NoJudgment92,o4herp,"Sneezing when my hair is wet&&&For some reason, every single time I wash my hair I start sneezing towards the end of the shower and continue to have sneezing fits for as long as my hair/scalp remains wet! Does anyone else have this issue! it usually gets better once I step out of the AC and go outside, but even then, if the wind picks up I 

may sneeze again. Is this something that can be prevented or do I just need to do hairstyles that I can fully blow-dry right after I get out of the shower? So annoying, because ei love my wash n go's and letting them air dry -\_-"
creatingapathy,o4herp,You are not alone! This happens to me too. I have no idea why though. I've just accepted it lol
hanap8127,o4herp,I recently bought a hood dryer. No more wet hair for hours and my wash n gos look much better.
Bluecraft55,o4gmwu,"Would I have to detangle my TWA everyday? What would be the best way to maintain length and some protective styles I could do?&&&I‚Äôm planning on doing the big chop soon and was wondering since my hair is going to be really short and tangles easily, would I have to detangle it everyday (I honestly don‚Äôt mind). Also, what would be the best way to maintain length and some protective styles I could do over the summer?&&&But since it‚Äôll be short, I‚Äôm pretty sure it will matte down when I sleep. Would fluffing it back up be fine and not cause too much breakage?"
dramatic_gasp19,o4gmwu,"1. Maybe try detangling every wash day (once a week) Detangling everyday will be too much manipulation and cause breakage. 

2. You can do a variety of styles: box braids, twists, faux locs, crochet, wigs, etc. Just make sure that none of the styles are too tight and moisturize every few days or whenever you feel like it. üòä Also, be sure to take small breaks between protective styling to allow your hair to breathe."
joiejojojo,o4fukx,Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner at least once a week. Comb your hair when it has the conditioner in. As for styling products that depends on what you want and texture
virgoduh,o4fukx,"starting a haircare journey: advice pls&&&
hi everyone. so i‚Äôve been buzzing off/cutting my hair short for as long as i can remember due to having no idea of how to maintain it. im  wanting to grow it out now but im unsure where to start. im 100% nigerian so my hair is super coily and kinky (hard to run a comb through tbh); i think it‚Äôs probably 4c/d. also, a widows peak + a hairline that is sort of receding :/ regardless of that, my hair grows pretty fast as i have to cut it every two weeks. i‚Äôm not really sure what i want to do with my hair but i need to start managing it and letting it grow out. can someone recommend products i should purchase to begin this process?? also, what types of combs should i be using in my hair? i‚Äôve included a few photos of my hair here: https://imgur.com/a/wLBRvqy thanks in advance!&&&ideally i‚Äôd like it curly and voluptuous. any products u recommend for that? is that achievable with my hair type ?"
Epicrealist,o4fge5,I am loving it! I had my hair that same way a few years back until I was brave enough to bleach my entire head. I don‚Äôt regret anything. üòç‚úÖ
KEnyinna,o4fge5,Nice!
ZeldaInDisguise,o4fge5,I went lighter! I haven‚Äôt had the chance to tone but this two tone hair is giving me LIFE&&&
M_Aku,o4eo3p,"When I big chopped my fear was that short hair would not flatter me. I never had short hair before and I was afraid that I would look horrible. The only reason I went through with it was because I had a vision of myself with the thickest and biggest afro. I wanted that more than I cared about having short hair. I was in a situation just like you. No natural hair salon anywhere near me,tender headed, no idea how to do my own hair since it was relaxed, and being 100% honest, I was lazy af when it came to taking care of my hair.


I went ahead and big chopped anyways. Learning to grow and take care of your own hair is really an experience that made me fall in love with it. I'm not saying that I feel like a baddie with my hair 24/7 but I feel like going natural was the best decision I could have made. I'm sure you'll have days when you regret it, especially in the beginning when you have to get used to a whole new self-view, but that will pass.

Hair can always grow back, life is too short to hold back.

Also to add on. I'm super low maintenance when it comes to styles lol. Every now and again I'll test out a style to see if it's worth the trouble and pain and if it's ok I'll add it to my list."
bionerdsupreme,o4eo3p,"I could use some words of encouragement and/or advice for a big chop.&&&I originally went natural back in 2015. I transitioned out of relaxers for about a year before cutting off the relaxed hair. My hair was probably around shoulder length stretched out. I did my best to take care of my hair and rock different hairstyles but I realized some hard truths about myself: 

* I am way more tender headed than I realized. I had a friend braid my hair once and I was damn near crying my eyes out. 
* I am not a good hairstylist, lol.

There are next to no natural hair care salons where I live (barely any black-owned hair salons, actually). I then made the dumb decision to get a sew-in from a friend and flat-iron my leave out. The heat damage caused breakage on the top of my head. I've made an effort to not apply heat to my hair at all and I've been good about it but between work, this pandemic and my deteriorating mental health, my hair has been the last thing on my mind. I came to the decision to just cut it all off since I'm not really taking care of it like I should anyway and that maybe shorter hair will make things less overwhelming for me; it would also give me a fresh start but I'm having such a hard time letting go. Every time I come close to cutting it, I back out! And I don't know why! So any advice on how to get over this fear?&&&Thank you for this! I can admit that I am lazy as well when it comes to my hair. But you're so right: life is too short and it will grow back."
duhduhdon,o4cxqt,"Hair Thinning from weight loss/lack of nutrients? Can I get knotless braids? Please help&&&Hi all 20F here. I was struggling for a few months eating wise. Around the start of May I noticed my edges were thinning out a bit. I asked my friends and family and they couldn't notice anything so I left it and continued my ""diet"" which consisted of around 1200 calories. Towards the end of May I noticed my edges had thinned out even more I showed my friends and family and they agreed. At the time I assumed it was because of improper hair care. But a few days ago I realised it wasnt my edges thinning but my whole head. I've been eating a lot better this past month anyways because I reached my goal weight, I've also been taking mielle gummies for 3 weeks or so now. I only yesterday realised its most likely not lack of proper haircare that caused this but the lack of calories I was eating. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed. Luckily my hair is quite thick so the thinning isnt noticeable unless slicked back but I still feel so horrible. I'm wondering if in the mean time if would be okay to get knotless braids. I dont have any motivation whatsover to do anything to my hair or even look at it. I just want it out of my sight and out of my mind. I'm so scared that when I wash and detangle my hair handfuls will come out. Has anyone experienced anything similar or has any advice. I also have a blood test with my GP soon and a consultation with a trichcologist.&&&thanks for the comment! I've realised now as well knotless isnt the best idea. I unfortunately live somewhere with a very small black community so it isnt possible for me to seek advice in person. I'm just gonna try and stick to my usual routine with more TLC and just hope for the best !"
happyhippoking,o4cxqt,"I went through a massive weightloss. When you're cutting calories, you're cutting energy. Weight loss is great for long-term and overall health, but it is stressful on the body. Hair is energetically expensive to maintain. Your body sheds hair as a result from the stress, the energy expenditure and sometimes lack of nutrients.¬†

Make sure you're eating enough protein, getting enough nutrients, drinking water, exercising brings heat to the scalp, and taking a multivitamin if needed or recommended by your doctor. My hair didn't lose noticable thickness or density and it grew back fine. Give it more time."
zeebabe22,o4cxqt,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them with thinning edges. I‚Äôd go to a stylist and seek some professional advice on caring for your natural hair. Putting away damaged hair may result in more damage your hair needs some love

LunaMisfit,o48i9n,"Shedding&&&I‚Äôm noticing that my hair is shedding more than usual.  Andy suggestions on how to stop this and to strengthen and thicken up my hair naturally?  

Much appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è"
M_Aku,o48i9n,I've heard tea rinses help with shedding. Specifically Green Tea.
joiejojojo,o48i9n,If it's shedding a concerning amount you should talk to a doctor/professional because it could be a health issue. You can't thicken your hair but you can use products like olaplex #3 to strengthen your hair
NoJudgment92,o487b1,"Yeah, I would definitely recommend seeing a curl specialist specifically for JUST a consult. That way you both can get a better idea of what is possible and what is not and the best possible courses of action. 

Getting her opinion on it and figuring out what she ultimately wants to do with the hair on her head is also important, while also preparing her for the worst-case scenario. Sometimes it may be better to just start fresh!"
Prestigious-Ideal303,o487b1,"Matted and messy&&&Hello everyone im looking for advice. My family and I have started fostering a tween girl. She comes from a background of neglect and past foster parents were either unable or just didn't understand the importance of hair management. I have been completely natural for over ten years. I maintain my hair as well as my four year old daughters hair with comfort and ease, however I feel that this is above me. Her hair is so tangled and matted that I feel a comb or bush would hurt her. I've tried for hours to use the conditioner and fingers method. My peers suggested I have her hair cut off but I do not want to traumatize her any further. She is a great kid that doesn't deserve to feel that she is not perfect in everyway. Please give me any ideas on how I can help her with minimal pain to her. I'm open and listening to all! Thanks in advance&&&This was my first thought but because of her past she has trust issues that gives her pause with new people. It took my husband and I a while to gain her trust. She is an awesome kid, sweet and gentle I just need to be sure I do not add to her trauma and I have built up some trust with her. I guess I will have to seek out someone that would understand this and start the interaction. Once she is able to see that she can trust a stylist as a person we could move to the next step.&&&We have invested in her and just dont want to loose the trust me built up thus far. I will seek out some local stylist in my area for private treatments on myself and the four year old so she can see."
blee2823,o487b1,"Have you tried taking her into a salon that does natural hair and getting a professional consult? It would take pressure off you and you could focus on supporting her through whatever happens. I would talk a professional stylist about her hair and your worries about trauma before bringing her with you to avoid her feeling uncomfortable. What are her feelings around her hair? What‚Äôs her ideal style? Maybe there‚Äôs a style she wants that you both you can work towards in steps, with the help of a hair dresser. That could be less traumatic and a special time for you two. Each time you go make a day of it make her experience around hair and it‚Äôs care positive and important. If you‚Äôre comfortable leaving your state or area, maybe people have suggestions for stylists that have the experience and professionalism to help in a positive way. Wishing you all the best I‚Äôm glad she has someone so caring in her life now"
zeebabe22,o487b1,You need to take her to a curl specialist or stylist who works with natural hair. Not someone who is going to berate her or stick their nose up but an actually stylist who loves natural hair and will understand the situation. You need to make an investment into her

b_yourowninspiration,o458s7,"I don‚Äôt believe there is a sulfate-free Ketoconazole shampoo (if you find it, please notify me, lol) because the goal is to strip the flakes from your scalp. I have Seborrheic Dermatitis as well, and when I first started using the shampoo, I had excessive dryness and slight breakage. To prevent this, I would suggest whenever using the Ketoconazole shampoo, follow up with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner+deep conditioning. When completing the deep conditioning, really focus on applying the conditioner to your hair and concentrate on the ends‚Äîalso, using leave-in conditioner afterward. Doing this has helped tremendously in preventing my hair from becoming dry. I really hope this helps!"
hanap8127,o458s7,I think you should use the shampoo but focus it only on your scalp. Maybe you Can section your hair first and apply a conditioner to your hair. That way the shampoo won‚Äôt be sitting on your hair for the 10 minutes.
sganiexty,o458s7,"Will a Ketoconazole Shampoo 2% dry out my hair?&&&My dermatologist prescribed me the Perrigo¬Æ one and wants me to leave it in my hair for 10 min. My only concern is that last ingredient is sodium laurel ether sulfate.

Is there a sulfate-free Ketoconazole Shampoo or Co-Wash anywhere? 

I have Seborrheic Dermatitis."
sisyphus753,o458s7,"I‚Äôm also on a prescription ketoconazole shampoo, and it is pretty drying. I wash my hair once a week with the prescription shampoo first, then a moisturizing shampoo, and conditioner last. I try to make sure that the prescription shampoo goes mostly onto my scalp and doesn‚Äôt rub into my hair too much. After conditioning, I apply a leave in conditioner and sometimes mousse if I‚Äôm doing a style. I‚Äôve been doing this for about a month and my hair hasn‚Äôt felt too dry so far. 

Also, if you don‚Äôt already have one, I‚Äôd recommend getting a dryer or diffuser! I found that using a diffuser on my hair after washing really helped to reduce the flaking, since it gets rid of the moist environment on the scalp. Just make sure to get a heat protectant as well!"
