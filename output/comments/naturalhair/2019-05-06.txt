All_Wayz_Lit,bnwje1,Natural Hair: Long Locs show stopping Mohawk&&&
4tenandahalf,bnulc0,Are you using only protein shampoos or moisturizing shampoos? You have to switch them up or your hair will hurt your hands lol
CoffeeB4Talkie,bnulc0,"The Mane Choice seems to be the first brand that doesn't dry my hair. I look at all of these other brands and would love to try them, but I'm afraid to. Lol"
Hakunamitatas,bnulc0,Heck yes! The mane choice made me love my curls!!
IWantMyBachelors,bnulc0,"Try aloe vera and the vitamin E oils. I cut the vitamin E capsules and mix the oil with the aloe vera. I put in it my hair for about an hour then wash it out. I let my hair air dry.

The next day, my hair was noticeable softer and appeared hydrated.

Edit: Also, rinse your hair in cool water. I usually make sure only my hair is under the faucet, turn the water to cool, then rinse. That helps a lot too."
M0420,bnulc0,"I think you should try using deep conditioner (heat optional but very helpful) after shampooing instead of a conditioner. I invest the extra money into a better deep conditioner. My favorites are TGIN Honey Miracle Hair Mask ($12 target) and the Joico K-Pak Intense Hydrator Treatment($15 walmart). When Im stressed and neglect my hair these will get rid of all tangles and make my curls snap back without heat. I also like the aussie moist conditioner; however, it works best when i let it sit and the steam from the shower softens it a little more. I have to detangle (I use a wide tooth comb, I have 0 patience) when using aussie or it wont do anything. I hope this helps :) remember heat and water are your best friends and you should watch Maryam Hamptons yt videos on her moisture routine and deep oil conditioning her videos helped me reduce a lot of frizz i thought was my texture but was really dryness loll

s.n. i use ogx tea tree cause my scalp is the definition of dry i dont worry about shampoos because i know my deep condition will make up for it, im more focused on my scalp"
MisSinterpreter123,bnulc0,"Your hair doesn't hate shampoos. You just need to find one that works for you. Here's the thing about shampoos, the job is NOT to condition. You can certainly use a moisturizing shampoo (Alikay Naturals, Camille Rose Naturals, Mane Krush makes good shampoos) but you want your condition to condition the hair. 
A good shampoo will get all of the gunk out of your scalp but you don't want to strip the hair completely. Focus on just the scalp when shampooing and let the shampoos run down your endsm. Once weekly, use a sulfate free shampoo and a GOOD deep conditioner. You want to rinse the conditioner out in cold water after 20-30 minutes. Follow up with the LCO or LOC method. 
Once you figure out your porosity, pick which method works for you. Always sleep on a satin pillowcase. 
Good luck."
PigmentedLady,bnulc0,I didn't know black folk use dry shampoo üòÖü§£ we **need** all the moisture we can get!
Pizzasuccubus,bnulc0,I personally only use shampoo every 3-4 weeks. I use a cowash every week on wash day. I love the edenbodyworks coconut cowash. When i do use shampoo I make sure to only focus on applying it to my scalp because the shampoo will run down my hair strands cleansing them. It‚Äôs a trick i learned from a youtuber. I also deep condition every week. And I am a fan of the LCO method for moisturizing.
PoetryRaven,bnulc0,"Hold up! You might be on to something, *takes notes*. So is there any specific reason why you use vitamin e instead of the other capsules available?"
SanityorPerfection,bnulc0,I‚Äôm just going to face the facts that my hair hates shampoo doesn‚Äôt matter what I use it‚Äôs always dry lol I just need to find the perfect conditioner and stop stressing myself out. üòå&&&&&&I‚Äôm afraid too. 1 I don‚Äôt want to waste money and 2 I don‚Äôt want to get something that will make my hair worse üòÇ it‚Äôs like a lose lose situation&&&Thank you for the info another thing to put on my list of things to try out! üòå&&&I‚Äôve tried the prepoo with the oil it made a tiny bit of a difference but I haven‚Äôt did a prepoo with oil in a few weeks because I‚Äôm so forgetful lol.

ScaredThug,bnulc0,I find that the cheap ones work best for me. Plus they tend to have the most slip.
freestyle45,bnulc0,if it's in your budget and especially if you have 4c hair give qhemet biologics a try.  their heavy cream and nourishing pomade saved my hair
kaysuh123,bnulc0,"Whenever you are shampooing your hair, try not to shampoo the ends of your hair - top of your head only, so you'll just cleaning the scalp. And then, when you are showering never use HOT water, always cold because it causes dry and itchy scalp.

Well thats why I do and it works for me."
leeleep93,bnulc0,How often do you wash? I prefer to cowash most of the time. If I shampoo too much my hair gets dry
moonchild2998,bnulc0,"I said it a hundred times and I‚Äôll say it another hundred times. I had to make sure my shampoo wasn‚Äôt clarifying because it was literally killing my hair. After solving that problem, no more crispy ends and smooth sailing from there. I still want to try Aussie moist though"
mumibee,bnulc0,Do a prepoo with oil of your choice and use a cleansing cowash like As I Am. Once a month or so use a clarifying shampoo or ACV rinse. Also doing a bentonite clay mask every 4 to 6 weeks helps a lot.
shermanedupree,bnulc0,"Best prepoo is mayonnaise!!! I mix in egg, and olive oil and shampoo and rinse with cold water (so you don't cook the egg lol)"
spicegrl1,bnulc0,"Have u checked whether your hair is protein sensitive? Protein is in basically every shampoo. Some ppl's hair gets overloaded with protein easily & becomes rough, dry & brittle. I'm having my best hair now that I haven't used any products with protein in them for 2 months. 

Also, check whether hard water could b the issue. Try shampooing with a chelating protein free shampoo with 2 gallons ($2) of warmed up distilled water for your next few washes. (Must b distilled. U r trying to avoid the minerals that r present in hard water that might b reacting with your shampoo forming soap scum that is coating your hair).

Don't use coconut oil since it can affect protein sensitive hair the same way. Go protein free with all your hair products for a month or so & see how it goes.

This is what fixed my hair. Also, finding out I had low porosity & doing hot oil treatments."

I use the fatter ones because I can make my parts much larger = less tension on hair. I use less than 30 extensions. I also use fewer so that I can put it up in a top knot & the weight is nonexistent. U have to really b mindful of how tight & heavy u do these.

Gemchick82,bnm5tp,"Ahh that 6 month to 2 year mark - that takes me back. Around that time you have your friends whom have always seen ‚Äúyour hair done‚Äù start saying now you‚Äôve changed and ‚Äúthey could never be as carefree about their appearance as you‚Äôve become‚Äù, guys start not really paying attention to you because they want the lie of long weaves, and you have the mom and/or the aunties giving you the side eye at church and other gatherings always asking ‚Äúwhat are you going to do with your hair?‚Äù as if the natural state of your hair isn‚Äôt beautiful. They don‚Äôt mean any harm but it‚Äôs real that the natural hair journey for many is seen to be political and some call it unprofessional and it may change your employment opportunities - although it shouldn‚Äôt. 

My advice though you won‚Äôt listen is DON‚ÄôT DO IT. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself. Don‚Äôt allow yourself in a moment of weakness to reach to the bottom of your bathroom sink cabinet hidden in the left corner for that emergency relaxer so that ‚Äúyou will look right for some event‚Äù. Don‚Äôt let the aunties talk you into a texturizer (aka that half step above a jerrycurl) as a ‚Äúperm that gives you more body.‚Äù  It‚Äôs not and the moment you look at your hair in the mirror you will realize this shit looks horrible and then cry yourself to sleep because now your hair is real unmanageable - it doesn‚Äôt want to lay straight so you get heat damage and when you try to embrace the curl you look like a chia pet despite all the oil you put in your hair.  So then you get really mad cut your hair all off do the BIG CHOP, wear lots of hats and scarves while waiting for your hair to grow out and then wear braids to try get back to where you were before you succumbed  to your weakness. TRUE STORY by the way but we‚Äôre talking about you. 

The problem with natural hair is that it takes time‚Äîa lot more time than many of us are willing to do with our busy schedules. It‚Äôs planning a wash day, it‚Äôs trying out several products and/or making your own until you find what your hair likes and finding a style you can manage on your own rather than relying on a hairdresser. It‚Äôs learning to embrace yourself and your hair while the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt understand why you should be that comfortable in your own skin and not feel the need to assimilate to fit in. 

It‚Äôs completely understandable to stop and restart the process. Don‚Äôt feel bad many have done it and ran back to the world of relaxers. But the one advantage that you have is YouTube and other communities that can teach you about the LOC method and find ways to make two strand twists and other low manipulation styles work for you. One Youtube I particularly like is a mother with her two young daughter ‚ÄúDiscovering Natural‚Äù she does lots of styles with hairpins and twists for her daughters. If you stick with it, you will find happiness in your kinks and as your hair grows you‚Äôll find others will eventually start to support your journey - because not only your hair will be healthy, but you will be too. Stay away from the ‚Äúcreamy crack‚Äù. Be patient and love yourself."
MisSinterpreter123,bnm5tp,"Wtf is a curly perm? A jheri curl? A texturizer?
Look sis, do NOT put ANY creamy crack in your hair? 

You need to learn about your hair. I understand it can be challenging, but you can do it.  March 2019 was 3 years post big chop. I watched a lot of videos on natural hair when I was transitioning and the first few months of being natural (I still do occasionally) and here's what I've learned.

1. Typing does NOT matter. People have multiple textures in their hair and you can have 3 type 4c naturals who can't use the same products. Now you need to understand your porosity and density,  it will take some time be because your hair is damaged but you will figure it out. 

2. I didn't find my current stylist until I had been natural for about 18 months, when I met her I wasn't sure if what I was doing was correct. I found out that not has I been doing things correctly but I only had 1/4 inch of hair that needed to be cut. Here's what I did: 1. Pre-poo the night before you wash. 2. Wash your hair once a week with a sulfate free shampoo. 

3. Deep condition after every wash. Leave the deep conditioner in for 30 minutes max and rinse out in cold water. When I had my initial consultation with my stylist, her assistant asked about my wash day habits and how often I deep condition, when I told her every week, ALL of the stylists in the salon said ""EVERY WEEK!?"" I found out that that's what you're supposed to do, but nobody really does it. 

4. LCO or LOC, I believe I did the LOC method. Sleep on a satin pillowcase. Make sure you wash the pillowcase once a week. 

5.  Your hair will be healthy and beautiful. You just need to be patient and don't go back to the creamy crack."
Monchi09,bnm5tp,"thank you so much for posting this! And honestly I thought it was just my mom who loves harassing me about ""jerrycurls"" hahaha"
PigmentedLady,bnm5tp,"Why are we still recommending perms? 

There's been countless of articles and reports that shows long term and short term health effects on this. Hell even the owners of some perm brands don't even use perms.


Also OP you said you havs heat damage. You need to cut that off to decrease the damage you already have."
PoetryRaven,bnm5tp,"Yea, i agree with the top comment. You should definitely give your hair more time to flourish and grow. As long as you're taking care of your hair adequately and learning about you hair type (i e. Porosity) you should be fine. In my experience, i hadnt really been taking care of my hair prior to my big chop so when i did it, my hair was just super short with no curls to speak of. So i ended up texturizering my hair, but as i started to care for my hair, my natural pattern came out and so i eventually cut off my texturized ends. 

Imma be honest, i shouldve never texturized my hair because i dealt with so many issue because of it. I understand the need to want your hair a certain way but natural hair is definitely something that takes time and patience.

If you really want a curly perm (salons call it a curl reformation treatment but its basically just jerri curls) Design Essentials also has a safe one. Those look really good for the first few months but then the curls drop in a weird way so you have to consistently get a touch up (i.e. more money youre spending)


At the end of the day its your choice whether or not to go through it, i did it with fairly successful results but i wouldn't do it again if i could go back."
SABRlNASPEIIMAN,bnm5tp,"Yes, you can get a curly perm on natural hair. I believe it‚Äôs called a Wave Noveau. There are videos about it on YouTube :)"
SeaSalterShaker,bnm5tp,"Hmm... have you tried twist-outs with flexi-rods or perm rods? If your hair has heat damage, that may help to hide it until you decide to cut it off. I recently had a perm rod set done on my transitioning hair, and even the completely natural sections of my hair turned out nice."
StarChildArt,bnm5tp,"Others have said it, but you should just cut it off. Your hair will thank you. Chemically treating hair that is already damaged is a bad idea, anyway."
seraiah_t,bnm5tp,"Perm on natural hair&&&Ive been straightening my hair for years and just decided to go natural about six months ago. I'm sick of rocking buns but my hair has lost it's curl pattern due to heat damage. I couldn't find any info online but can curly perms be done to natural hair?

Elegant-Rectum,bnl58b,"I mean, you don't have to wear your hair natural if you truly don't like it. It's totally fine to relax your hair or wear a wig if that is truly how you are most comfortable."
Izzythepan,bnl58b,"Just realized something&&&I don‚Äôt like my hair, I didn‚Äôt like it when I relaxed it, I don‚Äôt like it now that im transitioning and I‚Äôm pretty sure thats not going to change once its fully natural ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è at this point maybe the best thing is to just stop wasting my energy on it and just live in dutch braid land forever."
JDnice804,bnl58b,"Shoot, I‚Äôve been natural for about 5/6 years now and I go through love/hate periods with my hair. I‚Äôm 4a/4b, about bra band length. Honestly, I even get curl envy sometimes. 

For me, it helps to see the versatility of my hair. I do twist outs, I get silk presses, I rock braids. I love my hair in all different styles although sometime I still feel like an ugly duckling. I have to remind myself that I‚Äôm beautiful and worthy of love and good things. 

Your feelings are valid. I know it can be super hard. Transitioning hair is a challenge but I urge you to give it time. I gained more confidence as I joined the natural community."
dftba26,bnl58b,honey you have no clue what your natural hair will be like. dealing with relaxed hair is irritating but even worse is transitioning hair. you're LITERALLY in the trenches right now and that's why you're feeling that way. have you considered big chopping instead of transitioning? I did it 5'y months into my transition because I was fed tf up and I definitely don't regret it
itsKingLiz,bnl58b,I didn‚Äôt like my hair till I cut off my relaxed ends. Transitioning is really hard.
ttcool8,bnl58b,I used to hate my hair when I was relaxed as well as transitioning. Once I big chopped I only wore my hair in braids and hated my hair when I had to wash it and blow it out to get braids the next day. Only did I learn to love my hair once I really started rocking it out. I really only do twist outs braid outs and buns. I‚Äôm honestly a lot more confident in myself as well once I started wearing my natural hair. It truly is a process
Hashbrown9819,bnep4d,"Is it bad to wear only 3 different hairstyles( all of which include my hair being pulled back?&&&I‚Äôm in college(f21).So, I typically wear a high bun, two space buns, or just a pulled back bun. I was talking to my mom and she asked if I was planning on getting braids/getting my hair styled this summer( I have an internship). I asked her if what I‚Äôm doing isn‚Äôt enough. She said that I always wear my hair back and I should celebrate my texture and now I feel like I‚Äôm not doing enough. While on the other hand, my sister always wears the same hairstyle too( a high puff), but my mom said it‚Äôs different.Is it bad to just rotate these three hairstyles?"
Kdolla679,bnep4d,Could lead to traction alopecia
Sea_Soil,bnep4d,"I can relate because I have SUPER fine, tangle prone 4a hair and when I wear it ""out"" like in a wash n go, it becomes a huge mess after a few days and wants to loc up. So I just wear it in twists 90% of the time covered with a hat or scarf. I only wear it full fro when I want to look extra pretty or special occasions. Whatever you feel most comfortable with is absolutely fine! Don't feel guilty for rocking the styles that you do. :) 

&#x200B;

I don't think it is bad since you are rotating between these 3 styles, however, you should be aware that constantly having tension on not only the roots, but strands of hair themselves, especially in the same place over and over again, can damage and weaken the hair in those spots. For example, if you always wear a ponytail or bun in the same way everyday, the area of hair where the rubber band is will experience damage. And as others have mentions, if your buns are tight and pulling the hair at the roots, it could lead to hair loss."
gextnen,bnep4d,"Late to the response, but pay attention to the last half of this response, u/Hashbrown9819!

Growing up, I mostly kept my hair in a puff at the back of my head, and it thinned that part out :( My old stylist pointed it out to me when I was around 12/13 years old. It‚Äôs a bit better now, but the tension definitely ruined that part of my hair. 

So it‚Äôs good to rotate the ponytails.

But also be sure not to make them tight. Keep them loose and regularly massage your scalp with Jamaican black castor oil."
iggytheboywonder,bnep4d,"Definitely do what you feel comfortable with, but be aware that tension can cause damage!"
juiceiscold,bnep4d,"Do whatever you feel comfortable with and also what you have time for lol. It‚Äôs great to try new things but you don‚Äôt have to if you don‚Äôt want to. As long as your hair is healthy, I don‚Äôt see why you would need to change it up"
scbbK,bnep4d,"Idk. I wore my hair in basically one style for 7 years as a kid because no one around me (including my immediate family) knew how to manage my hair. I even had it parted down the middle, and I never had a problem with alopecia. I think it depends how tightly you've got it pulled back. Because there are folks who've worn their hair for years in locs or braids who don't have that problem, either. 

Do you, hon.  If it doesn't hurt, you look good and you're happy, that's what matters."

ApolloniaVitelli,bn02sj,"Yup, happens all the time. Once I called and was quoted $120 for box braids. When I walked in the shop wearing nice clothes and a Marc Jacobs bag, they quoted me $200. When I told them what I was quoted via phone, they made all kinds of excuses. No thanks."

Chocolatecitygirl82,bn02sj,"Yep, happens to me all the time. Even at the same salon, the price wildly fluctuates. If I call and the person I‚Äôm speaking with doesn‚Äôt recognize/know me, I‚Äôm quoted a higher price.

I would like to go somewhere with everything I could possibly need to do my hair as far as products and equipment and have a professional there to help me part the back of my head, oil my scalp, clip my ends, and guide me along if I'm struggling.

Lovelynell4,bmsnh0,"I can‚Äôt speak to how to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this now, you may have to go through again, because it‚Äôs how you twist that matters. 

While using whatever product works for you, twist the twists while you twist. So, how I do: brush the section you‚Äôre about to do, grip your roots, and then while you‚Äôre putting one strand over the other, rotate your hand with whatever strand is the one on top (how you do Senegalese twist). I use either a curling custard or foam for my twists. Each have different results but the way you twist matters. My hair also comes out less frizzy the more damp my hair is weirdly. So I need spritz of water or coming out of shower or letting it airdry and stretch over night, and then applying my usual LOC method products. I cannot twist with dry hair of any nature"

lexy-plexy,bmsnh0,Do this with flat twists and you're in business

juiceiscold,bma8xl,"Mielle Organics Curl Refresher&&&Hi new to the sub! 

I‚Äôve been natural for about 10 years on and off, have been using Mielle organics and only certain Shea moisture products. I‚Äôve just really gotten the hang of a wash n go that works for me, but I‚Äôm trying to find a product that will keep my curls intact until atleast day 5. I love using Mielle organics, but this is a new product and I don‚Äôt want to waste my money.
Has anybody tried this product from them?"
