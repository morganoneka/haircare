BrokenStrawberry,gyncxj,"You could have been describing my exact hair experience as a child! I always dreaded hair days and would be in tears for hours while it was being done. (Not helpful for the pain it's causing right now, but it did get much better for me as i got older.)

Have you spoken to your friend who used to do her hair? They might have some tips or strategies to make it easier.

Definitely repeating what others have said about ensuring she doesnt feel like an anomaly, seeing other girls going through the same rituals, and not referring to her as tender headed (it feels othering and miserable). 

Keep at it with her detangling it herself sometimes, maybe in the shower (i found that hurt less, my hair was so dry it absorbed all detangler), and going over it yourself when she's done, going through where she's missing and how she can find those knots herself next time.

Having her get a haircut (if she likes how it looks) might help you both get a fresh start, with a bit less hair to deal with, developing a routine that works for you both for when her hair is longer again. 

Go through potential styles with her, and get her excited about what she can do with her hair! Once I had something really exciting to look forward to at the end of Hair Day, it helped me bear through the pain (and still does now!)

Best of luck!"
Evening-Pirate,gyncxj,i agree on the sectioning idea i would never recommend a texturizing to an 8 year old child
Lisiat,gyncxj,"well, I guess the issue here is not her hair or any of the hairdressers.

It looks like your daughter is just not happy with her skin and hair. You should not be worrying about her hair, but with her soul. Try to take her to a psychologist, she needs to accept who she is, not only her hair.&&&change her hair, or even relax her hair, will not make her happy. She needs to accept who she is, that way, her hair will not be a problem, all of that situation seems just a reflection about what she is feeling"
MissD34,gyncxj,"Tough situation...maybe consider texturizing it instead of completely relaxing it? That just means you’re not leaving the relaxer on long but long enough that it’ll loosen her hair a bit. Maybe do this until she’s a bit older and can handle the detangling/process? 

Or...when washing her hair, try doing so in sections, then detangle it (with lots of conditioner and a wide tooth comb) by section and as soon as you’re done, twist it up."
MyDogCanSploot,gyncxj,"Help with my very tender-headed daughter&&&My daughter is 8 years old. She was adopted at birth. She’s “brown” (her words). My husband is “peach” and I am “tan” (half-SEAsian). For the first five years of her life, I did her hair and felt that I was doing a decent job. My daughter has very thick, 4c hair. I wanted to keep her hair natural and learned all I could about hair care. But hair days always ended in crying and screaming. I then took her to a salon and my daughter cried the entire time. She never wanted to go back. We tried every brush. Talked to everyone with any knowledge in natural hair. We bought every product recommended. A family friend then offered to do my daughter’s hair and she was wonderful. My daughter freaked out and cried the first few times. But over time, she learned to love the family friend and hair days. Our friend did my daughter’s hair for about a year and she was a God send. I don’t know what she did but hair days seemed much less traumatic. But then our friend got pregnant and she could no longer do hair. I tried to do it myself again but I ended up on the floor crying, feeling broken that I was hurting my daughter. I took her to a woman who braids and offered to put in crochet extensions. The woman’s two daughters assisted with the braids. They detangled for about an hour, went to braid, and it was tangled again. My daughter refused to go back to that woman. The friend who was doing my daughter’s hair recommended someone. We took my daughter there once. Detangling took 2 hours. We tried to get another appointment with her, but she never called back. A friend recommended another salon with a woman who prided herself on only doing natural hair. She was patient and gentle with my daughter. Detangling took forever. Much longer than she expected. My daughter sobbed and shook the entire time. At one point, she hurt so much, she threw up in the chair. The poor woman looked traumatized by the time we were done. She then told me that I should bring my daughter in to have her hair relaxed. She felt it was the only way to get her through it. This coming from the woman who was exclusively natural hair. I never wanted to relax my daughter’s hair. I never wanted to look like I did not want to take the time to care for her hair. And I didn’t want my daughter to think that Euro-centric hair was the only kind of beautiful. She has gorgeous hair and it broke my heart when she told me she hated it and wished she didn’t have it. We’ve been working on hair for two straight days this weekend between taking down hair, washing, detangling, and braiding. We have to keep taking breaks because she screams and cries in pain and then I get mad at myself for hurting her. I’m at a loss of what to do next and would love some advice.&&&This is our routine. Maybe you can see where I'm messing up. When the hair is braided, we moisturize with olive oil and will sometimes co-wash, depending on how long the hair is staying in the style. On hair days, we spritz her hair with leave-in conditioner and water. Take down hair. Finger detangle. Pre-poo. Wash hair. Finger detangle some more. Add conditioner and let it sit a bit. Finger detangle some more while soaking wet. LCO. Detangle in sections with Denman brush, wide-tooth comb, or EZ Detangler. Loosely twist sectioned hair when detangled. After it's detangled, I'll go to part it and it's in tiny knots again. I start detangling at the bottom but if I hit a small knot or we hit a tangle close to her scalp, she cries and begins to shake. I try not to show any frustration, but I hate that she's in pain and I'm the cause of it. I'll say sorry or give her a hug, but it's no solace to her. So I have to walk away for a bit and come back. Then I'll apologize, comfort her, and go back at it. 
During this process, my daughter is watching a movie and playing a game on my phone or playing with toys. 
She tried detangling it on her own today, which I thought was a big step for her. But it was still very tangled when she was done."
Sam-0808,gyncxj,I know this may seem weird but have you tried sectioning and detangling with water. Buy a spray bottle and fill it with water. Spray it on each section before combing. It saved me from headaches.
blaquebeauty15,gyncxj,"Your daughter sounds like me! I have very course, thick hair that tangles quickly. I wear braids most of the time.  What we do (well my grandmother helps me) is after I wash, condition and moisturize she sections my hair. Once it's sectioned she binds it with thread. When my hair dresses goes to braid it, she only unbinds the section that she's braiding so the rest can stay untangled."
mochigoodness,gyncxj,"Some thoughts,

Have you tried a pre-shampoo?  It can help to use before shampooing.  You’d slather it on, they’re oil based which then help you start the detangling process (finger detangling, just one set of fingers at a time, not trying to glide all you fingers at the same time).

As someone that was called tender headed (though more 3C/4A), approach her gently, with an intention of just doing a section at a time.  Keep a spray bottle handy, don’t try and detangle dry ever.  Spray a section of her hair and then apply a cream to the wet hair.  

Allow your daughter a special privilege while sitting, let her watch a favorite movie or pull out the iPad.  She gets distracted and a reward for sitting.  That may help too with her distress.  Make it a time that you talk and are happy, so even if she chooses to play a game, be aware of what she’s doing and be there with her.

Keep her hair in some sort of protective style, just daily maintenance until wash day again.&&&I'm going to suggest you find her a black owned salon that specializes in children.  Don't just drop her off there, but don't intervene either.  She's seeing how little you and your husband do with your hair and of course would like to be like her parents.  Let her see other little girls with the same hair dealing with getting their hair done.  Maybe watch some youtubes together and get some ideas for styling.  Also stop calling her tender-headed, if you are saying that word in front of her.  

At a certain point you can't just stop and give her a hug each time you run across a knot.  Acknowledge it and move on, but more gently.  Make up silly sayings, knot is found, better slow down, just silly stuff.  You just take your time and either finger detangle or get some little scissors and carefully cut out the knot if it's not retrievable.  

Appeal to her maturity level, remind her that she's older now and that if she needs a small break, to raise her hand and you can rest for 2 mins.  Make it pleasant, try not to let yourself get to that point of exasperation.  Give yourself breaks too!"
CoffeeB4Talkie,gyn2uw,"I never purchased kids shampoo. They went from baby body wash to whatever I used on my hair. So... maybe by a year old?? 💁

I think that they're okay to use regular products now....."
momof2under2,gyn2uw,"Kids Hair Care&&&Sorry if this has been asked before but I have a quick question about natural hair for children, aged 3 and 2. They’re both 3b -3c and currently we’re using the mane choice children’s shampoo and conditioner once a week. I also use the mane choice 3 in 1 conditioner for a cowash in the middle of the week as needed and I use the tropical Moringa mask on them once a month. At what point to most people stop using children’s conditioner and switch to a regular one? My son’s hair can get pretty dry and he has a patch of hair in the back that is definitely high porosity. My daughter on the other hand - you can use any product at any time and her hair reacts well, including leaving her with just the children’s line.&&&Thanks! I use the kids shampoo just because they aren’t there yet with the eyes 🤦🏾‍♀️&&&Yea that makes sense - I was getting relaxers since I could remember so I imagine my mom used adult shampoo too. I think I’ll keep the shampoo for sure since it doesn’t appear to be a problem but I’ll prob stop buying the children’s conditioner once I run out. Thank you!"
Jupitersunset,gym630,Beautiful pic I love your suit!
doojaw,gym630,Did you do a twist out to get your hair curly like that?
mayalouu,gym630,Beautiful

Sam-0808,gylfpu,"In my opinion , as long as you acknowledge the history of the hairstyle and wear it as appreciation of the culture then you’re good. Just be careful that the braids don’t break your hair off."
jouska_exulansis,gylfpu,Some white people I know that did box braids ended having to cut off a LOT of their because the hairstyle was very damaging for their hair type! I’d say just do some more research and be careful because you could lose your hair <3
stonerartistbasicass,gylfpu,"Should I get box braids?&&&Okay I’ve gotten a lot of mixed answers on this, online everything says I should absolutely not go anywhere near this hairstyle. But every time I’ve asked someone(n/white) in person, Im told not to worry about it, it’s just a hair style, and I should do what I want. I’m a Caucasian 23 yr old woman and I’m married to a half African American man who has been telling me for a really long time he wants to see me with braided hair and that I should ask his cousins or aunts to do my hair. I’ve struggled having crazy curly hair in a family of all straight hair and so I’ve always loved doing crazy stuff with my hair, I’ve dyed it pink, blue, red, purple, I’ve bleached it, I’ve chopped it short, and now I’m growing it out. I really wouldn’t mind the braids, I think it would be fun, and I’d try my hardest not to let any outside negativity get to me especially if my husband likes it, but really want to know if it’s an issue. Like I said, I’ve gotten such a mixed response, so I figured I’d throw the question up here. 

TLDR; I’m white, my mixed husband wants me to have box braids, I’m unsure if this is something that’s genuinely problematic to do, or just a problem people had with the kardashians."
CoffeeB4Talkie,gygu5l,"I did headbands and always made sure I had in earrings. 

*Sighs* I was just saying yesterday how much I miss my short hair."
FoyGirl,gygu5l,Maybe try box braids or twist outs.
ParadisesPlate,gygu5l,Box braids would suit you 😊
PrairieJack,gygu5l,"Look up some pics of Lupita Nyong'o’s hair when it was short. She had so many creative looks. You definitely want to accessorize. The more unique, the better."
UrDadsFave,gygu5l,"At this stage it's about accessories. Headbands, clips, ear rings. I know ear rings aren't hair accessories but when I had my tea my earring collection got lit."
gillyrosh,gygu5l,"Getting bored w/the side part? What styles can I do when my hair is in that ""mid-growth"" stage?&&&&&&I'm trying to grow my hair out from a TWA. I'm in the transition phase where it's too long for most TWA styles, but too short for other styles. Any advice on how to do different styles. I'm getting kinda bored with the side part."
CoffeeB4Talkie,gyglat,"If it's working for you, go for it. Everyone is different."
MissD34,gyglat,"I have used Cantu’s leave in conditioning cream with no issues for several years. I tend to not follow “trends”. If it works for you, keep using it."
emmalouweeze,gyglat,"Is Cantu Leave In conditioner cancelled?&&&I’ve posted here before about my allergies to products.. 
I have not yet been allergy tested but I’ve tried a few different conditioners.. most recently shea moisture and I have an allergic reaction on my face each time. 

I big chopped my dreadlocks a few years ago after having them for about 10 years and being very minimalistic in the products i used. Once I cut my hair I started out using Cantu and then i saw all over the internet it had been cancelled for having alcohol in it. 
I switched brands, but almost immediately started having reactions on my face.. around my eyes.. around my lips. It was so confusing I’d never had skin issues previously and it took me awhile to connect the dots that it started when i started using more hair products.. I’ve tried switching so many times now and recently just got Cantu leave in again to see if it would cause a reaction.... and it didn’t. The temptation to just continue using it now is real, but of course I don’t want to ruin my hair. 

Is Cantu still cancelled?"
sandycheeks72,gyglat,"Not all alcohols are drying. If it's working for you, by all means keep using it."
sdossantos97,gyglat,"you always do what works for you. a lot of people still don’t know the difference between drying alcohols and moisturizing alcohols, so they see the term “alcohol” and I swear they think of the rubbing alcohol that they have in their cabinet lol. one thing that I have learned the hard way is to never listen to the internet when it comes to what products and ingredients I should or shouldn’t be using. I recently went back to using hair grease and I am never turning my back ever again."
FoyGirl,gydko1,Where are the pics?
HealingTank,gydko1,Congratulations!
