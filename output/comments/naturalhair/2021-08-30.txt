Bluecraft55,pipqvq,"Braiding Hair: Small Toothed comb or wide toothed?&&&I asked my mom to braid my hair today (box braids) and she agreed. But, after she parts it with a small toothed comb, she goes in with that same comb to brush my hair out. However, I keep telling her that she should use a wide toothed comb after she parts it so I don’t lose too much hair. Am I misinformed or is she ruining my hair?&&&Yeah it was. We detangled then blow dried it so not too much hair was lost"
caramathew3,pipqvq,Braiding hair really one of the best hairstyles one could try.
komugiii,pipqvq,"If your hair is properly detangled before styling, it shouldn't be too much of an issue

Regardless, combs with wider teeth are more forgiving so that's what I would reach for while styling

edit: also, I'm assuming she only combs out the small section she intends to braid...if shes combing out the whole part definitely get her to use wider teeth tools :)"
sierrahemmingshair,pipqvq,Big Toothed Comb is good for your hair
Interesting_Flow7714,pipknu,Sem me apaixona🙂👏&&&

not_nae-nae,pilnhc,"My afro always looks her best when I have nowhere to go😅&&&&&&Thank you!!!&&&Well... This is day 5 hair, but I used a miss Jackie's leave in conditioner, Miss Jackie's ice curls gel and castor oil/olive oil mix to seal&&&This comment gives me life! Thank you so much kind stranger 🥰"
Kcvexo,pik7p1,Wait on until your next wash day if you want to do a clay mask. It's hard to get the clay out of your scalp so you might want to go in with a shampoo afterwards
OmegaFoxFire,pik7p1,"Can you do a clay mask after a wash day?&&&I’m blow drying my hair today for the first time so I can trim it. I am thinking about doing a clay mask tomorrow to define my curls again before styling but I already washed, conditioned, and deep conditioned my hair today. And I heard that a clay mask basically strips your hair like a deep conditioner.

Would doing a clay mask tomorrow then adding some conditioner be too much? Or will my hair be fine?"
DoubllW,pig7t5,Product placement determining your hair shape&&&[removed]
Ajoura,pi6wmv,I’ve been following a simple wash routine lately. I realized that my hair likes to make these random coils if I don’t touch it for over a week. Is this common? Is my hair trying to tell me something important?&&&
Elrick-Von-Digital,pi6wmv,You have curly hair
Miriam-Esi,pi6wmv,My hair does the same. Your hair is healthy
hipdady02,pi6wmv,That’s it’s natural clumping pattern. Work with it (ex defining natural clumps) not against it
poochee_pansy,pi6wmv,"Sometimes I'll alternate between wearing my hair in a puff and afro for a week or more. The only thing I do to it during the week (after shampoo, deep conditioner, leave-in and oil on wash day) is spray it with water periodically and pick the roots, every now and then oil my scalp. 

I also see random coils like yours appear out of nowhere. Even more so if I do a braid out before I start wearing an afro. I guess when you're not combing or bushing your hair much she just kind of does whatever. I'm positive it's not a sign that something is severely wrong with your hair, just that she's relaxing."
spyplotting,pi6wmv,My hair does the same thing
usagi18,pi6wmv,"Your hair likes your routine. Keep doing it. Tweak where needed, but if it ain’t broke don’t fix it! Some parts of your hair may be coilier than others , they are fine tho :)"
hatonithalle,pi0j6g,Gorgeous hair 🥺🙌🏽
layibelula,pi0j6g,This is really good. I'll follow up for more of your post. I went natural when I got pregnant with my first daughter I never went back. My two daughters are natural with a big afro as well.
pumpkinspicemami,pi0j6g,"Haircut experience at a natural hair salon (products used listed)&&&&&&Thank you 🙏🏽&&&[shampoo ](https://deya.do/product/olive-juice-shampoo/) to wash 

[This ](https://milkshakeusa.com/products/milk_shake-moisture-plus-lotion-2/)was applied right after cutting my hair since my hair is very dry. It wasn’t rinsed out. 
This hair[ gel ](https://www.google.com/search?q=garnier+hair+gel+curly&client=safari&hl=en-us&prmd=ivsxn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEutv7qObyAhXkVTABHQqJCLYQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&biw=414&bih=715#imgrc=G9vwXvT-SgxUdM) and hair [smoothie ](https://www.garnierusa.com/es/acerca-de-nuestras-marcas/fructis-style/curl-treat/curl-treat-butter-hydrating-leave-in-styler) was mixed and applied to define my curls.  
I was in the dryer for about 40 mins and after it was stiff with little to no volume. Thanks to the humidity and heat in DR my hair looked better by the end of the night (pic in dress). 

The second to last picture is how my hair looks now (a week and one day after my haircut) before washing it. I exercised a lot this week and was always sweating. To sleep/ take a shower I put my hair in a high bun and never applied anything to my hair. 
I’d say these hair products are worth trying! 👍🏽&&&Thank you 🥰 
Yes, it was!!! I love Go Natural Caribe but they closed since the owner moved to Canada /: my professor recommended this salon so I decided to try it. You should def go!!&&&Thank you!!! I’ll be posting more in the future. 😁 
Thats good, Keep it up! Going natural was the best decision I ever made because maintaining curly hair straight is so time consuming."
wonkynoodlez,pi0j6g,"You've got curls by the pound!! Also, was this at Arantxa's salon? I've been meaning to go but can never find the time."
CheerfulFlame,phyj49,"1 year of growth! (August 2020-August 2021)&&&&&&My hair naturally grows pretty fast, but also I'm just really gentle with it! I wear it in protective styles a lot or try to do hairstyles that minimize the amount of tension that's on it, and I make sure to detangle it with conditioner to minimize breakage! Also I massage my scalp with oil a couple times a week to promote growth and keep my hair moisturized :) And I try to trim it every 3 months, but I'm not sure if that helps with growth, it definitely keeps it healthy though!&&&Thank you so much! :)&&&My hair was a mess 5 years ago, my mom started relaxing it when I was ~12 and I started doing it myself when I was ~16, and about three years ago I decided I wanted to stop relaxing it because I didn’t know what to do with it/couldn’t take care of it properly and it looked terrible unless it was straightened...so I stopped relaxing it and grew it out for a year and two years ago I cut it off! And it’s been flourishing ever since then, I’m so happy I did that :)&&&That’s so creative 😁 I would never have thought of that, lol&&&thanks! :)"
Mamaciitaa96,phyj49,HOW
hatonithalle,phyj49,🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Edit: wow wow wow I just looked at this photo three times and the growth is astronomical!! Gives us hope haha 😂
lucyricardo21,phyj49,Impressive amount of growth
otakurini,phyj49,My 4c hair could never. Congrats on the growth!
weaboo801,phyj49,"Meanwhile my hair has been the same length for 5 years. 😭😭
I don’t care how much I hate my hair, I’m never cutting it off. Only trims"

ChumChums2400,phxewe,"Hi guys! Combed my hair out completely and then deep conditioned it, but idk what to do with it! Any tips? I have tried it all but my hair isn't taking to any of it!&&&&&&Aw thank you! I'll try that!&&&Thank you! I was wondering if I could style it a certain way, but not in a braid/twist! Whatever you think coils suit me! Still discovering different styles but at a point of being lost now 🤣"
Kcvexo,phxewe,I think it looks really nice. You could just add some leave in conditioner to keep it moisturized.
PrairieJack,phxewe,It looks good how it is right now. What else are you wanting to do? Is there a certain style you want to try?
Babialive,phx083,Mine does the same
Fancy-Pair,phx083,Your hair is goals. Any tips on tangle teaser types / techniques?

Would love suggestions on how to reduce shrinkage. Any other products that might work better?&&&Nope.&&&I styled right after I washed my hair, but it wasn't completely saturated - it had dried a bit. I'll try that next time.&&&High porosity"
hatonithalle,phx083,The texture is on point!! 😍🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
ready10276,phx083,Beautiful hair!
rk724,phx083,Ugh...this hair typing thing has got to go! lol...anyway ur hair looks nice OP
spinachbuteaten,phx083,4B is L/S/Z shaped. This hair is coily. So 4c
waitwert,phx083,Amazing !
wooweeitszea,phx083,"Looks gorg! When you styled,  did you apply the product to completely soaked hair (like in the shower) or did you wet the hair and style as you go? I’ve found that when I apply the products to my hair when it is completely saturated, the cast is set when my hair is most elongated. It still shrinks but not as much I think."
Flamentix,phuxqt,"Hair porosity&&&Alright for the longest time I've thought I was low porosity but I'm honestly just sooo confused after watching some videos. For reference my hair is very short (twa length) and I have no heat or chemical damage.

When I do the strand test my hair floats on top, but when I submerge it, it floats to the bottom and stays (this is on freshly washed hair)

When I feel the cuticle, it feels bumpy but for the longest time I've thought said bumps are as a result of my tight coils eager to spring back into place

When I dry my hair it takes three hours to COMPLETELY dry and I'm guessing it doesn't take longer cause the hair is so short

When I spray water on my hair it gets DAMP but I still see very tiny beads of water on the top and if I spray enough the water will roll off my scalp onto my shirt or whatever I'm wearing.

Can anyone help me find my hair porosity once and for all?"
liteskinnedbeauty,phuxqt,"If the hair initially floats in the water, and it collects water beads when sprayed (until it is saturated) - it is low porosity."
Disastrous_Curve_78,phu9sa,Total agreement conditioner is a MUST.    I condition & leave in every time I wash.
Disney_Villian,phu9sa,Things like this is why people don’t trust hair stylists/braiders.  If the person has a style in their hair for no the at a time they need to at least do a rinse out conditioner that goes with the shampoo.  Maybe it’s an issue of time for her(time is money).  If people go to her and discover her braids are breaking their hair off due to dryness they will stop going.
Kcvexo,phu9sa,You are not wrong. Jam doesnt condition anything even if it says conditioning on the bottle it's a marketing gimmick. Just buy some aussie moist conditioner for $5 and tell her to use that
Millennial09,phu9sa,"Conditioning your hair - am I crazy?&&&I have a 16 year old foster daughter who has started to do other people’s hair — mainly box braids, extensions, etc. When she washes their hair, she simply shampoos it and does not use conditioner. She does the same with her hair. I have gotten onto her about this before as I’ve always grown up with washing entailing shampoo, conditioner, and even a leave in after before styling hair — especially with braids. Today she was doing my friend’s daughters hair (age 12) and only shampooed her hair. I asked if she conditioned it and she said “I used the conditioning shampoo I don’t need conditioner. I will use jam to condition it.”

 I told her No, she needed to use conditioner before putting braids in the girl’s head and even called my friend to verify that is what she does to her child’s head — she verified and said conditioner must absolutely be used before braiding. 

Just wanting to see if I am in the wrong here? I think it’s a dangerous game to not condition or use leave in conditioner on someone’s hair and then go straight to braiding it with Jam. Is conditioner now not something natural black women need to use the to condition hair? 
Thanks in advance for any feedback!&&&Thank you for the input. I’m at the point where if she doesn’t want to condition her own hair that’s a fight I’m not going to continue having but will remind her. However, her not conditioning other people’s hair is a true concern since she’s getting paid so much to style and protect these people’s hair. I will enforce this and ensure from now on she’s giving her customers the option. Like you, if I don’t condition my hair it is a whole ass mess. Lol. My hair needs the conditioner.&&&I use the assume brand and love it! Thanks for confirming my worries about the Jam — teens just don’t like to listen! 🙃&&&I do think this is part of how she grew up and I’m trying to change this behavior but it’s been pretty hard. I’m going to have another talk with her about conditioning her hair.&&&Thank you for the advice! She wants to go to cosmetology school so I plan to see if we can tour one or even go to the salon I used to frequent so she can talk to someone and hopefully they can explain the importance of conditioning hair and just protective styling in general. Definitely don’t want to alienate her."
PrairieJack,phu9sa,"If she goes to cosmetology school they will teach her to use conditioner. Perhaps you can enroll her in some cosmetology courses so she can learn the basics of haircare. She can do self guided learning after getting her license to become more of an expert. She needs to be learning from well trained professionals if currently getting her info from the internet or YouTube. Also be aware that in most/some state she will need a license to do hair and I don't know how this will effect you, or it will be an issue. Just know that y'all can be getting in trouble if she doing hair without a license. I'd check you state's laws. 

I use conditioner on my hair."
Quiet_Rip8607,phu9sa,"i’d have to agree. i even very rarely shampoo my hair at all, maybe twice a month just to get the dirt off my scalp. black hair needs conditioner more than anything! honestly i’d push her more about it, especially if she’s doing others hair. like it was said, if she doesn’t want to do that to her own hair, fine, i still think that’s a celery bad idea. as she gets older and her hair and scalp
changes, bc everyone’s does all the time, she’ll find out the hard way"
SnooObjections9371,phu9sa,Conditioner is absolutely necessary. Your daughter is wrong.
stealthpursesnatch,phu9sa,"I would leave this alone. I don’t know how long she’s lived with her, but she’s likely to perceive your information about conditioner as yet another thing she’s missed out on because she doesn’t have a traditional family. In the short, medium, and long term it doesn’t matter if she conditions hair. She will eventually learn. You may risk alienating her by telling her she is wrong."
walleiscute,phu9sa,"I mean if she doesn't want to condition her own hair. All power to her. But I think if she's doing other people's hair she at least needs to ask what their preference is (conditioner or not). As a black woman, I need all the conditioner I can get. It smoothes and helps my hair stay manageable. My hair is a tangled disaster until conditioner sits in it for a good 3 mins lol."
zsaz_ch,phu9sa,"You are not in the wrong and I’ve seen this a lot growing up especially with the girls that get relaxers ( not against  people getting relaxers while still having a hair care regimen). But I would mainly see it with girls who would relax there hair and do nothing else to it beside throw a style in it. Nothing against them, they just didn’t know any better. When I was relaxed I would at the minimum use conditioner."
