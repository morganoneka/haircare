ButteryBakedSalmon,d4v064,"I don't understand ""Day (number) hair""...&&&i have a great routine, great products, good methods, when it comes to my natural hair.(3C, Low porosity)

i couldn't be happier with its health right now. I've learned so much in the past year about natural hair and how to care for it.

I could never quite understand when someone goes ""*this is day 3 hair*"". i dont get it.

are they putting it in chunky braids at night and then taking them out in the morning? or are the wetting and refreshing their hair every morning?

 cus from what I've seen on you tube, they're not really adding any products for the week. just relying on the moisture from day one...?

 ive been trying to figure this out so i can try doing it, but i dont understand it.

i can see that its usually twist outs or braid outs, but the curls look all bent out of shape after day one.&&&Thanks for the detailed reply!

I'm gonna try putting my hair in 2 pineappled tonight and then puttin my bonnet on.

We'll see if my curls are better preserved that way.

I think I'll try using a curling jelly by day 3 and putting a little leave in under it.&&&okay, yea that makes sense. 

And yea, im totally fine with my hair not having perfectly defined curls lol. just trying to get my hair to not be crunchy and dry when i try to wear it out for a whole week lol.

thanks for replying!"
boldkulturebeauty,d4v064,"I'm a once weekly styler, My goal is to usually get 5-7 days wear out of my hair before I wash and style it again. The key is starting with healthy hydrated hair and them using products that will aide in helping you get longevity out of the style with minimum frizz.

For me, shampooing regularly and deep conditioning weekly helps greatly with hydration. The cleansing process allows your strands to easily receive moisture and then the dc process helps to close the cuticle and seal it in. I prefer to use plant based products and layer my  gels (this help to fight frizz, especially in humid areas and increase longevity of the style). Using products with humectants will help draw moisture to your air and anti-humectants will help to prevent moisture from escaping. The types of gel you will use depends on the characteristics of you hair and the level of humidity in the area you live. Adding a leave- in conditioner under you gel can also help with maintaining the moisture level of your hair as well. 

A wash and go is my routine style, I do not refresh daily or twist my hair at night. I simply put on a bonnet, get up in the morning, shake it out, and go about my day."
coconutmillk,d4v064,"i usually get 5-7 days between washes in the summer and up to 10 days in the winter. 

i plop my hair loosely on top of my head with a scrunchie at night and sleep on a satin pillowcase. in the morning i shake it out and let gravity help the curls fall back down. 

it doesn’t always look perfect with each curl exactly in place, but that’s part of embracing my natural hair (3b/c). i’ve come to find beauty in an appreciate the imperfection."
511lonette,d4sy99,For some reason distilled water helps. I started using it last year and I noticed that my hair doesn't dry out as fast.
ButteryBakedSalmon,d4sy99,"How do some natural wear their curls out everyday without dryness??&&&Hello! 

(3C, Low porosity)

So i pretty much have a good handle on how to take care of my hair. 

I've got a decent routine, group of products i use, and measure i take. And my hair has never been healthier!

One thing i havent been able to figure out is how some natural folk will wear their curls out every day! and the curls look great and moisturized and somewhat defined (*idc too much for definition)*

My question is how?? my hair gets dry, frizzy, and a little crunchy if i try to wear it out more than 2 days in a row. 

i deep condition every week. and put my hair into twist after detangling. use a light sealing oil to lock in the leave-in conditioner.

my question is, how would i be able to wear my curls out everyday without them getting dry after day 2??

i feel like theres no way to get around re applying moisturizer + water and detangling every 2 days for this to happen.

But others have said they just put their hair in ""pineapple style"" at night, thats it. ive tried it and it didn't do much for me.

any advice + tips are welcome!&&&is it a leave in conditioner spray?&&&Yea ive heard that its better!
Thanks for replying!"
CaptDeliciousPants,d4sy99,"I use a leave in curl defining spray conditioner. There are a lot to choose from but the Shea Moisture brand is probably the most common and readily available. Carol’s daughter has a vanilla scented spray that I like a lot and is good for braids and twists too,"
simbisir,d4sy99,"This is definitely real. Where I live has hard, alkaline water. Once I installed a softener in my shower, my hair and skin dramatically improved. My wash n gos easily last twice as long now."

That’s me in the video 🙈. 
That’s my go-to routine to preserve my natural curls. I started transitioning last year so you see in the 1st video my curly roots and straight ends. I’m going for a big chop soon."
Kiiro_16,d4n7gj,Video/tips for detangling and twisting short 4C hair.&&&All help is appreciated 🙃
PrincessOfDaSouth,d4n7gj,Use a wig brush. Or detangling brush. They work far better than detangling combs IMO.
boldkulturebeauty,d4n7gj,"My advice is to invest in a quality deep conditioner and a good tool. I have tightly coiled hair as well and I've found that letting the conditioner sit for a min or two make a difference in the ease of detangling. Section the hair into at least 4 parts and work backwards for from the ends to the root. I like to detangle in the shower, detangling on wet hair helps with distribution of the products and ease of detangling."
hangeryyy,d4n7gj,"I find the most ease detangling my hair in the shower when I wash it with my fingers, then a wide toothed comb, and then a fine brush. I wash my hair almost every night so I may have more ease with it than the average person, but I still prefer wet detangling over dry."
PencilDoodle,d4jl3x,"Need advice&&&Hair is this curly when wet, but when dry I can feel my curls closer to my scalp but I can't see them? There is a slight wave but its barely noticeable. Its longer on top and shorter in the back.  Some spots are curlier than others. In order the back of my head is the curlier than then the sides, and the top is the least curly. I had a lot of relaxing treatments growing up, haven't had braids in since I was a 3rd grader and have been straightening my hair a lot with no protection. Tried researching and just cant find a situation as close to mine as possible. Could anyone help?&&&I'm off to a good start then,  I haven't straightened it for a while, my hair is pretty short as is but I've been meaning to get a trim and braided since it's been so long. My hair routine im not really sure what it needs. I was guessing more hydration or something.&&&Lol looks like I got a little investing to do but I'm glad I'm on the right track. Embracing my natural hair more  is a big goal of mine and I felt pretty late to the party. When I would cut it it would grow back pretty fast but then kinda plateau and stay the same length. I appreciate the help a lot and I can't wait to see more improvement.&&&:) thank you"
PrincessOfDaSouth,d4jl3x,"First try to stop putting heat in your hair for awhile ,especially without a protectant. That’s an accident waiting to happen. You also need protective styling for growth and it helps your curl pattern a lot. Maybe your hair is going through a transition period. Try getting a hair cut or big trim and going from there,also starting with a good hair routine.&&&Yes always keep your hair moisturized. Use a Satin Or silk bonnet/headscarf. Co wash once a week. Do protective styles often,like twist outs,Braid outs,box braids. Whatever works for you. Deep condition once a week. Regular trims. Heat in your hair is okay as long as it’s not often. A nice flat iron once in a while is food for stretching the hair out. You’re on the right track. Just find a routine that works with your schedule.&&&Glad I could help! Happy naturaling :)"
DreamyEyedCyclop,d4jifv,"How do I grow out the hair on the side of my head? Ya girl don't need a fro-hawk!! 😭 (4C, big chopped 1 month ago, been wrapping, deep conditioned yesterday)&&&"
LadyJae94,d4jifv,Suave and Mane has some great products for us. I also have 4c hair! Congratulations on your big chop! And try wild growth or kaleidoscope oil.
barleyink,d4jifv,"So this is something I’m actually in the middle of. My hair is looser than yours (3c) so it’s been a little bit of a different experience for me, but I actually just kept cutting my undercut for about a little more than 10 months before starting to grow out the sides. Other than that you can cut it down to one uniform length or just sit it out, using wigs and other protective styles to keep the integrity of your hair intact. 

 Also! if you sleep on your sides, stop that. It actually makes it harder for your hair to grow on the side that you sleep on."

thepansuperwholock,d4fpoy,"Short hair styles&&&Hello! I recently did a big chop because my ends were damaged because of hair bleaching. My hair dresser cut my hair into a heart style but that didn’t last long because the damaged hair sticked out so over a month the heart became a circle. 

I’m a sophomore in high school so hair is very important. My dad made me straighten my hair because he says its a nappy, kinky mess (yeah i know) but I’ve loathed my straightened hair since I’ve got it (for numerous reasons). 

I’m trying to go back to the curly life as my mom and I call it but my hair is going to be a short little afro and i have no clue on how to style hair this short. If you can please recommend me some styles. (I also had braids late August and that kinda crashed and burned really fast)

[my usual styles](https://imgur.com/a/1qNwzTP) i just want to do more than the poof or the pard. Thank you"
Fiorak,d4dmi2,"How to continue wash day after deep conditioning?&&&So I'm going to be washing my hair Sunday (and attempting twists/braids since I just learned how to braid today). However, I usually rinse out my deep conditioner with cold water and that's usually the last step of whenever I wash my hair. Now that I'm going to start (properly) using creams/oils/gels, should I wet my hair again after rinsing out my deep conditioner? Or will it be fine to just use the products on my hair after rinsing it with cold water? I'm 3c and low porosity if that helps.&&&Thanks for the advice! I ended up attempting twists last night and today they came out okay!"
boldkulturebeauty,d4dmi2,"I do not use creams and oils that much, but I do occasionally use a leave-in conditioner under my gels. From experience,  I can tell you that most products work best on soaking wet hair. Quality products tend to be concentrated having and having a sufficient amount of water in your hair will prevent you from using to much product, help the products to spread evenly throughout the hair, and reduce the risk of flaking."
tajahmahal,d486np,"Hi everybody! I’ve been natural for almost 5 years, but I’ve never really been able to tell what my hair type is! Does anybody have any ideas?&&&"
AfroJaneAusten,d3r5s3,"Will history look back and think it was crazy?&&&Will history look back and think it was crazy that people sewed other people's hair onto their heads, or suffered chemical burns and spent thousands so their hair looked like that of another race?

It feels like a strange dream that it is so common."
cmore_money,d3r5s3,Yes
01honey_bee,d3qlc8,"That's not a ""weird curl pattern"". Those are curls that won't go back to thoer original curl pattern because of heat damage. (Happened to me so I would know) try a basic 2 strand twist out for starters, then later you'll want to start cutting off the dead hair"
HeyItsKimberlee,d3qlc8,"Echoing what others say, there’s definitely some heat damage. Hey, it happens. Deep conditioning will definitely help repair. I recommend doing braids as a protective style or even overnight with some cream, gel, etc.. You could do the same with two strand twists, basically something to manipulate your curls to have a similar pattern all around."
ashliiiita,d3qlc8,"How to style weird curl pattern???&&&&&&aww man, i figured as much but that sucks to hear. :( I might consider just doing a big chop then (of course I’ll think about it more though)&&&Okay so, I have really frizzy, undefined hair that barely even has a curl pattern.. this is just my second day hair (actually, it hasn't even been 24 hours yet) and it already looks like this.

&#x200B;

I think this is a result of heat damage, but I'm not sure. Do you have any tips on how to make my hair look a bit more.. defined/moisturized/curlier? Thank you!! (I'm completely new to natural haircare, sorry!)"
ccangel16,d3qlc8,Try doing a deep conditioner treatment or a protein treatment and sit with a heating cap. Sometimes heat damage can revert hair back to its original curl pattern depending on how bad the heat damage is.
sharrrbearrr,d3qlc8,"Try olaplex, find a (preferably natural hair)salon near you that offers the service. People usually do it with dye jobs but you don’t have to. You should see a noticeable difference. Then you can pick up some of their at home products for continued/better results.

I also recommend aphogee 3 step if you’re not protein sensitive. 

Finally you may need a trim."
