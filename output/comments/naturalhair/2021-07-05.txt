Lelemcgeegee,oihify,Now i wanna see a picture of your hair OUT in that frohawk!
Nicer_Dicer_,oihify,You look so pretty!
TexasProud311,oihify,That looks awesome!
jikajika,oihify,"For my frohawk peeps. We got OPTIONS!üòù&&&&&&Ehhh! Thank you so much!   
I still can't wait to get a braider that knows how to do geometry with my hair, but this is a good first start.&&&Boom: https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/nx7a8u/this\_is\_the\_first\_time\_in\_my\_life\_where\_ive\_said/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3&&&Thank you!   
I'd like to take this time to thank my orthodontist for my grill in my tween years (aka braces) and my parents for paying for them. This comment belongs to you.üòÑ&&&Well thanks boo!üòò&&&Oh thank you! Lol!üòÑ&&&Thank you so much!&&&Yeah,  she did a good job.   
The fade is what got me shook! I've had a barber for over 20 years, but something she did made it look more awesome than usual. Had me shook...&&&Yeah, I like it too.   
I love how I take styles, usually for guys, and feminize the shitzu out of it. LOL!&&&Thank you very much!"
luv-u-3000,oihify,"That hair! That smile!! Girl, you are slaying!!! üëëüëëü§©ü§©ü§©"
musicbecca2,oihify,This is too cute!
piratebones,oihify,"You have such an infectious smile, love the hair!!"
Lelemcgeegee,oidwis,You did a great job! His curls look great!
nikafeetpete,oidwis,My brother let me (finally) help him with his natural hair!&&&&&&We have very similar hair type but he has ALWAYS had a shaved head. I recently shaved my head and for the first time he‚Äôs growing out his curls (and had no idea what to do)! It was really nice bonding over hair and also seeing how receptive and open he was to hair care tips.
sqwzmahmeatybts,oidwis,Beautiful head of healthy hydrated curls! Great job!
ratnissneverclean,oid4wl,my hair is thriving&&&
BriefYou8628,oicvni,Lack of moisture plus daily shedding (normal) will cause this.
ProfessionalAd9906,oicvni,Is this too much shedding?&&&
Test1986,oicvni,Nope
basket-case47,oicvni,It's a good amount for a month without washing. My hair ball is about that size after a month.
bebelala13,oicvni,Nope. And i gotta say your hair is poppppiiiiing!!!
iana_franks,oicvni,"Nar, I wouldn‚Äôt say that. I have wayyyy more. This is pretty healthy whe compared to mine."
spinachbuteaten,oicvni,Nope bit it also depends how ur hair was coking out. Did it come out during detangling or did every time you manipulated ur hair it felt like ur hair was really gummy and weak and just coming out
tamoki30,oicvni,It‚Äôs not a lot but you could definitely reduce the amount in the future. Did you do the the white bulb test to determine if it‚Äôs mostly shedding/ breakage?
meh3191,oi9eqq,The entire Creme of Nature Pure Honey line is really good and pretty inexpensive!
memyseIfandI,oi9eqq,What are some good shampoos and conditioners for thick type 4 hair and what‚Äôs your wash method?&&&The less expensive the better for now but I‚Äôm open to all suggestions! Currently I part my hair into 4 sections and wash it that way.
tamoki30,oi9eqq,Slather it in oil to pre-poo then use a couple of squirts of Dr. Bronner‚Äôs peppermint wash (it‚Äôs safer for hair than shampoo). Be sure to wash it in twists and not more than once a month

EEOA,oi2wid,"No leave ins, moisturisers or stylers?&&&I‚Äôve been seeing this float around on Twitter and wanted to hear other thoughts. There are people advocating for literally using only shampoo and deep conditioner in your hair, and saying it‚Äôs the healthiest and most moisturised their hair has ever felt. I‚Äôm curious if anyone here has had similar experiences?&&&Yeah I was wondering about longevity as well. I doubt the people saying this are monthly or even weekly washers."
Opposite-Horse-3080,oi2wid,"I think this is just trend.. however, I don't want to dismiss it outright, because I think a lot of this depends on your porosity too. I'm low po and I wash my hair every two weeks (I don't use a lot of styling products) and I have to LCO and revive 2-3 times a week. If I tried this, my hair would be dried and matted in a few days, no matter how great my DC is. 
Maybe some people need a break from the products, but I've found a routine that works. 

I'm very cynical about natural hair influencers, because the very nature of the game is getting views and originating the next hot trend. You can't really do that if you've been settled on working routine for years. There are only so many products you can review or styles you can try, especially at this stage in the social media game.

This reminds me of that trend a few years back, co washing every day/every other day. I tried that and after two weeks my hair was dry and breaking, but others saw their hair thrive. I don't pay much attention now, but there was a time when every self respecting natural had a dedicated co wash product. I don't hear much about them nowadays. 

All that to say, it could work for you. If it does, great! If not, that's okay too. But if you have a routine that has been working for your hair, it's ok to pass on this trend. There are so many 'revolutionary' quick fixes that come and go."
happyhippoking,oi2wid,"I do this when I'm short on time. My hair is really soft in a pillow-y cotton-y way. It feels light and airy. It lacks definition though and I feel like it's more prone to single strand knots if it's loose and down. It's super soft with a nice sheen though.

*But* it absolutely depends on the quality of the DC. If the DC isn't moisturizing enough, my hair will dry out in 2 days and I'll have to re-wash & re-moisturize. My area has hard water and high heat, high sunshine so the DC needs to also have some oils or butter to provide some protection once the water has evaporated. Otherwise, dry hair in 2 days."
Understanding_Naive,ohxmdh,How are you styling your hair now?
findzahra,ohxmdh,"How to stop matting at the roots?&&&I‚Äôve always had thick hair with different textures on different sides lol. So all over I‚Äôm like a 3C but at some areas of my roots (and partly right side) I‚Äôm a 4A. So naturally my roots gets super coarse and I‚Äôve dealt with knots all my life. 
Now, my hair is at its longest and I‚Äôm noticing that there are so many dreads/matts at my roots! 

I don‚Äôt want to sacrifice the length because I know my curly girls know getting long hair is a struggle. What can I do to help? What hairstyles/protective styles should I try?&&&I typically braid it in two French or three strand braids. Nothing fancy because I sadly don‚Äôt know how to cornrow but if it‚Äôs not in that, it‚Äôs out. Started developing alopecia around my edges from all the messy buns and tight ponytails so I have been trying to stay clear of buns as much as I can"
ur_notmytype,ohxmdh,How often do you detangle And do you use deep conditioners?
bebelala13,ohtgz5,"Hello! This is 4 months apart. Im curious, does anyone‚Äôs hair gets bigger instead of longer when DRY (when wet its obviously longer because the hair is heavier)? How long did it take for you to see it getting longer. Thanks for sharing! üòÉ&&&"
boopalooo,ohtgz5,"Length for me came in hella slow increments, thats one of the downsides of shrinkage for me at least. My hair grows outwards not down"
findzahra,ohtgz5,My hair has always grown outward and it‚Äôs now past my chest. I was told it‚Äôs because my hair is dense at the roots‚Ä¶? So I‚Äôm assuming the same for you!
happyhippoking,ohtgz5,"My hair grows out, then drops down. It needs to have enough weight for it to hang. My hair is bra strap length wet and shrinks to shoulder length dry. It's a cute length because it balances the width with length."
milkpal,ohtgz5,"My hair does the same thing, it‚Äôs so frustrating 
To have visible length the hair has to be really really heavy. My hair, dry, is shoulder length but when wet it‚Äôs closer to mid back"
whore4tonystark,ohtgz5,my hair gets bigger too üòÇ but I do see it growing when I do a length check
copperbutton,ohsanm,It could be the water quality; nothing lathers well in hard water.
ontariodwarf,ohsanm,"You might have buildup on your hair - product, mineral or just dirt/sweat/oil etc. when my shampoo doesn‚Äôt lather it‚Äôs bc my hair is extra dirty so I usually wash twice and it‚Äôs fine on the second go. That‚Äôs usually my cue to clarify!"
vintagepop,ohsanm,"Can your hair porosity affect how your shampoo lathers?&&&I have natural 3c/4a medium to high porosity hair. It's been almost 2 weeks since I washed my hair and I washed it today with garnier whole blends honey shampoo (has sulfates). 

When I first put it in my hair it feels like it's lathering and feels sudsy but when I look in the mirror there's no suds at all. I rinse it and shampoo again and there are suds visible but not as much as I see on videos with people using the same shampoo...

is there a reason why my shampoo isn't lathering? Or is it normal...like when I'm done my hair feels clean but idk if it is really clean if it doesn't lather a lot. Thanks <3&&&That's true my shower water sucks ass&&&It's weird bc I don't really use a lot of products at all on my scalp or on my hair and I use a sulfate shampoo every time so idk it's weird lol"
M_Aku,oho5fy,Since this is a natural hair sub you might not get a lot of responses about proper relaxer use. Try cross posting this to r/blackhair . You might get a quicker response so your coupon doesn't expire.
miaemo,oho5fy,"I agree that this isn't the best subreddit for relaxing tips, but I do want to say one thing that I have learned although I am no longer relaxed. You don't want to relax it until it is bone straight. Relaxing until your hair is bone straight is over processing the hair and completely eliminates your elasticity which weakens the hair and leads to breakage. You always want to leave some texture to the hair. If you relax it to bone straight and have overlap when you touch up, you will create a lot more damage on top of any damage incurred using blow dryers, flat irons, and any form of manipulation."
raisedbynarcs123,oho5fy,"Silk Elements relaxer vs Revlon Creme Relaxer&&&I have coarse resistant wavyish hair and I want straighter hair. I used Silk Elements relaxer (strong level) and it took me like 5 treatments of using it in my hair to get my hair straighter, but it is not the desired results I want and I want it more straight. Silk Elements is moisturizing and kind of silky though.

How is the Revlon Creme Relaxer (strongest level)? Does the Revlon Creme Relaxer work on resistant coarse hair and make it almost bone straight?

&#x200B;

I bought the Silk Elements from Sally Beauty and I am wondering if I should return it. My receipt expires in a few days, so I hope to get responses on here soon!"
cheezenjelly,ohm7v1,"Depends on the porosity of your hair. If it‚Äôs low porosity, yeah maybe. I just use ACV and it works better than any other shampoos and it detangles as well"
hanap8127,ohm7v1,That would be best since you‚Äôre shampooing more often.
ontariodwarf,ohm7v1,I work out 4-5 times per week and I use sulfate free shampoo most of the time but I use a clarifying shampoo every 3-4 weeks
tamoki30,ohm7v1,Yeah
tinyluffy,ohm7v1,"I work out daily, should I still use sulfate free shampoo?&&&&&&my hair is high porosity should I still use it?"
Alone_Jellyfish_7968,ohl5hy,"Your makeup is great - natural but sexy. 

(I'm 50 y female in case you thought I was creeping on you! ha)"
Cold_Athletic_200lbs,ohl5hy,I seen you at that gym. Aren't you in Akron?
M_Sia,ohl5hy,People with pretty red undertones can always pull off red hair. ü•∞
NetoKnowsThangs,ohl5hy,The color is giving me lifeüòç
PseudonymDays,ohl5hy,"This is the color I want once I leave the military lol&&&Also that cut is very flattering, I want to go to a natural salon so bad"
Rainesstar,ohl5hy,What did you use for this color? I‚Äôm dyed ginger but I love the tone your hair has.
Sweetlikecream,ohl5hy,Beautiful!!üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Winterblossom25,ohl5hy,Definitely!
acai_of_relief,ohl5hy,LOVE the color and it goes so well with your green purse and pants in the first pic! and the navy dress in the second pic!! omg who am i kidding it looks great with everything
curlianne,ohl5hy,I‚Äôm really thinking about dying my hair this color!!
hidden-question,ohl5hy,agree. I really wanna do this color. wHats the damage looking like?
mynameislexythomas,ohl5hy,what dye did you use???&&&looks amazing by the way !
zeebabe22,ohl5hy,Ginger hair slaps&&&&&&Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è&&&You should. Tips though get shadow roots because when the black grows out it can be a stark contrast against the red. Invest in color safe products and go to a professional who colors natural hair specifically.&&&I always thought I had yellow undertones I guess I‚Äôm more red lol&&&My stylist mixed like six different shades of adore so I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a mixture of brown oranges and reds and I had to get my hair double processed first before color application&&&You should do it&&&Thank you&&&I‚Äôm not wrong girl lol&&&No damage if you go a trained professional who does color on natural hair specifically tight textures. It‚Äôs just high maintenance ensuring you‚Äôre doing the right things to maintain your hairs health
AffectionateAnarchy,ohkqcl,"A youtube video will give you a really good visual but after washing and conditioning youll.apply some product to a small section and taking an extremely small part of that youll coil it around a rattail comb lil tail part then pull the tail out straight down. For your head it might take about half an hour, I might be off a lil bit because I havent tried it in years but as I remember that's pretty close"
Jlm6745,ohkqcl,I got these comb coils twisted 2 weeks ago so I think it‚Äôs time for a re-twist but I don‚Äôt have the money to go to any beauty salon so I‚Äôm going to have to do it myself. How do I wash my hair and how do I re-twist it? Please go into detail&&&&&&Do I loose it out and wash it? Do I wash it with my hair in a stocking cap or do I wash it without the stocking cap?&&&Should I keep it in for another week?
NotahJho,ohjtrt,Your hair looks so healthy and beautiful! I have recently started embracing my own curls too that I haven't seen since I was a child as I've always straightened my hair ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è amazing progress!

deejeyteejey,ohjtrt,You're looking luxurious af
miaemo,ohjtrt,"Went to a salon for the first time since I decided to go natural exactly 2 years ago. I'm so happy with my progress!&&&&&&Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è&&&Thank you! üòä&&&Thank you!&&&Thanks! I love my natural hair so much. Even my stylist had fun ""boinging"" my curls before straightening it.&&&I transitioned for 14 months before I big chopped. That first picture from October 2020 was my hair about a month after my big chop."
tamoki30,ohjtrt,üòçüòçüòç
Healthyhair12,ohhxtc,Full hair wash routine&&&
Choice-Armadillo7253,ohhsqc,Transitioning again&&&Three months ago I let my mom let flat iron my hair (foolish on my part) and now a few sections of my hair is completely straight. I noticed when I washed my hair it smelled burnt ü•¥. I was able to chop some straight ends off that only had little damage but the other parts I would have to shave my head if I cut it all off (I needed a trim anyways). I‚Äôm so sad because it took me two years to transition and finally big chop now I‚Äôm going to have to go through that process all over again. I‚Äôm definitely will not be using heat any time soon. I‚Äôve learned my lesson üò≠üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
PseudonymDays,ohhsqc,This is the same situation I'm in! I went to a salon for a trim and silk press - left with heat damage and sadness lol. I'm upset that I lost my 2 1/2 years of progress and now I basically hate my hair. I used the aphogee 2 step protein treatment and it helped with some parts but not all.
Raddi_maddi,ohhsqc,"Don‚Äôt worry, sometimes if you stop using heat and do some deep conditioning treatments the curl comes back. I used to flat iron my hair every week and when I went curly I never did the big chop. It just took sometime for my curls to fully come back"
denominare,ohhsqc,Yes and depending on your hair some protein as well to help heal the shaft&&&Yes and depending on your hair some protein as well to help heal the shaft
