Blaque-Cat,tdo0rc,"Dry hair can be combated by establishing a consistent cleansing, conditioning, and styling routine with quality products. Oils, creams, and leave ins are not going to get rid of dry hair, they will only lubricate it. What is your current routine?"
lovepplusethings,tdo0rc,"any products (oils, leave ins, etc) good for my TWA 4b mid-low porosity hair? looking for something on the lighter and curl defining side. all my current products make my hair dry and weighed down.&&&"

Collegesuxks,tdlfmg,"Good hair day for once😮‍💨&&&&&&How do y’all know if your curls need a trim? I feel like I can’t completely tell. My hair doesn’t stay as moisturized as I want it to stay, does that have to do with how putting the products on or does my hair need a cut?"
Curious-Here1,tdlfmg,Beautiful
My_HairSmart,tdlfmg,Pretty you❤☺
Mysterious_Fun5879,tdlfmg,Soooo pretty! ❤️❤️❤️
Numerous_Win_1123,tdlfmg,Do a blowout/stretch your hair to see if your ends need to be trimmed.
SecretAntWorshiper,tdlfmg,Ugh I'm so jealous. My first girlfriend had hair exactly like yours and it was so beautiful 🙂
TayElectornica,tdlfmg,Well your the most beautiful woman I've seen so far today.
Toofywoofy,tdlfmg,"When my hair seemed more weighed down and easily tangled, a small trim helps me.


And yea, the moisture could be based on your products and application. If you post your routine, it’ll help gives folks an idea of how to offer suggestions."
Unlikely_Try3848,tdlfmg,🔥🔥🔥 but RIP to your DMs 😂😂😂🙏🏾🙏🏾
Wavewalker2,tdlfmg,Looking lovely! ;)
_negativecr33p_,tdlfmg,You look very fine
lildrewdownthestreet,tdlfmg,"I do it both ways: 

1. Put my hair in mini twists and trim the ends (doesn’t necessarily have to be mini but it helps to trim and have a style after) 
2. I blow dry stretch my hair after applying heat protectant bc I want to almost straight (I don’t press my hair bc I’m afraid of heat damage :( but i know those who straight their hair n gets no heat damage so do what you feel is best)

I can tell my ends need to be trimmed if my twists end don’t twist like the other part of my head and if it’s blow dried what ever looks see through in the mirror lol 

Ps you’re pretty love the hair 🥰"
1faith3pens0excuses,tdgcbl,"It looks fine to me. It reminds me a lot of my ends. Some of my hair strands do not curl in the same direction and some do not curl at all. Unfortunately, it makes my hair look frizzy a lot but on the other hand it is amazing how gene expression works!"
ElephantEars5,tdgcbl,"Is the left strand damaged? I’ve just my hair cut but I still have some ends without shape. But I can’t see any split ends.&&&&&&Thanks! I was cutting them out but at some point I needed to stop or it would start to become noticeable.&&&Me too! I have random straight hairs poking out of my head. It's so weird!&&&Thanks, I need to stop following curly hair youtubers lol&&&Thanks! Yeah I think I have medium to high porosity."
HappyToBeMoi,tdgcbl,It looks normal to me. You could also have high porosity.
PunkGF,tdgcbl,"No damage. Every strand isn’t going to be picture perfect. Sometimes you could have missed applying product in some spots, or that spot may have just rubbed clothing or something more than others. Not a big deal at all."
aa_km,tdgcbl,"It looks healthy to me! Just because it’s not shaped or undefined doesn’t mean it’s unhealthy. You could always get it shaped if the length or style bothers you, but it def doesn’t look damaged"

DaniMrynn,td8yad,"Absolutely! Been doing same as OP for about 3 years; it's definitely a trial and error process, but my hair is retains moisture so much better this way."
Independent_Ad8963,td8yad,"Great Definition!&&&&&&Always try different styles and know that products can give you different results with those styles. 

Just because your hair isn't like theirs in those videos or someone else doesn't mean you can't achieve that. You can, it'll be your own because not everyone's hair is the same.

I would assume and give up before I even started because my hair wasn't their length and I knew my curls wouldn't curl like that.
I was wrong and I also realized that some products give me better definition than others.

Always give your hair a chance if you're someone who loves definition.

You give your hair love and it will show love back!

The Products Leave in Conditioner & Taliah Waajid Hold me down gelle and for cleansing I enjoy the Shea Moisture Charcoal Bamboo Cleansing Shampoo.

I'm going to start trying a new gel that's less expensive.

For the leave in conditioner I've actually been changing because I feel like I have found a good one for my hair but what I was using previously was Cantu and now it's Shea Moisture Strengthen and Restore Leave in conditioner.

Overall I've just been trying to maintain moisture because  Moisture < Health < length for me and less breakage.&&&I've been doing more stretched out Styles that i almost forgot how crazy my shrinkage gets.

Disastrous_Can4962,tcvbi4,does it help you retain length?

blackporsche22,tcvbi4,"After I put the rice water in and wash my hair it feels like all my products go in wayyy better, idk what it is, but I love how it makes my hair feel."
swxxtie,tcvbi4,"putting rice water in my hair is a process haha&&&&&&It's my first time doing it so I guess we'll see but it's ment to help strengthen the hair so I would assume so&&&Is my first time trying it out but it's supposed to make the hairs stronger and shinier, detangle the hair and help with hair growth. I haven't washed it out yet but I'll let you know how it feels when I wash it out"
EloquentElixir,tcv55c,"Even though it's in a low bun, it's a bun regardless and can be the cause of your breakage since you wear it often. Try twists or wash n go's, and you might need to trim more than once a year. Make sure your ends are protected/moisturized since they're the oldest parts of your hair"
Independent_Ad8963,tcv55c,"As long as your low buns are tight you're good and you're hair is moisturized you'll be okay. I used to have crazy breakage at my ends where my ends were ALWAYS breaking off and I was so frustrated with my hair but I realized that it was all because I wasn't moisturizing enough and so I cut a few inches off. My routine is much better and in a year I've reached about 2 inches below collarbone length after I've been stagnant at collarbone length for so long.
What has worked for me is was leave in conditioner and gel. 

What's your hair touting like?"
NeatSimple2970,tcv55c,Good questions
Romennaj,tcv55c,Check out the #blackgirlcurls method. I kept having split ends because of layering oil based products and thick oils on my hair which blocked water from reaching it. This was the first 10 years of being natural. I’ve been oil free for a year and grew 4 inches and kept it all while getting quarterly professional trims.
liviybones,tcv55c,"I agree with the comment above. I also recommend deep conditioning and switching up your hairstyles when you can. Though your styles are low manipulation, the breakage could be the result of the low buns as that can cause some tension on the hair. A Deep conditioner would help give and maintain moisture, which I highly recommend as a method to combat the tension."
my-weird-reality,tcv55c,"breakage prevention tips ??&&&Okay so i did the BIG chop in 2018, went all out with a buzz cut. since then, i’ve been trimming my hair maybe 1x a year, I usually keep my hair in a low bun or 2 braids, but it’s in a bun most of the time. my hair has been armpit length for nearly a year now. 

I cut my hair because it was so damaged before and i’ve always wanted long hair, but before the chop i wasn’t able to get past collarbone length.

today I did a length check and i was shocked to see  that a couple of strands that survived the breakage are really long, they were the length i’d expect my hair to be at now. 

What can I do to stop my hair from breaking, I now know that my hair isn’t growing slowly, but it’s just breaking off very easily. Any tips/ styling suggestions?"
ontariodwarf,tcv55c,"Make sure you’re gentle when you manipulate your hair, don’t do it too often, always have some kind of product in like a leave in, detangler, conditioner, etc. and use good tools if you use tools at all

If you do your hair the same way every time - not even just the same styles, but if you section/part it the same every time, always start at the same section, etc - then you’re likely repeatedly manipulating the same parts of your hair and creating weak points. Try to mix it up if you can 

Also, you could try incorporating proteins, botanicals and silicones into you’re routine. They’re great for forming protective films on your hair and kind of filling in the cracks in damaged strands to make your hair stronger and less likely to break"
ChoraSoul,tcs2oe,"I wash, condition, and moisturize my hair in twists all the time. I like twists for shampooing because it give me good scalp access. Sometimes I retwist the ones that are extra frizzy or unraveled and then I use a satin scarf to help tame the frizz."
Funny_Breadfruit_413,tcs2oe,"Everyone's hair and scalp is different. You should be washing your hair more often since it's itching and flaking. Yes you can wash your hair in twists but it's up to you if you like that ""look"" after washing. I personally like my twists better after washing them because they become really soft and frizzy. Some people don't like that look at all."
Inclyte_,tcs2oe,Try spraying leave-in spray and oiling. Some serums prevent dandruff and itching. Check out some products
Necessary-Bet-2581,tcs2oe,"Can I get my hair wet or wash it while having twists?&&&So I got twists almost 2 weeks ago for the first time, they still looking great but my head been itching and I’m starting to have some dandruff. Before twists I’d deep wash my hair like every 3-4 days but I havent washed it since. When I shower I wear a bonnet. I’ve asked my friends who have twists or have had twists before and some said I can’t get my hair wet and some have said I can but I’ll probably have to retwist a little myself afterwards which I really don’t want to do. So can I or not? If not what do you guys use to keep your hair moisturized and healthy with your twists in?&&&So it won’t mess them up but just look different?"
sherlgirlx3,tcs2oe,You can wash your hair but the parts will get frizzy after . What i do to minimize the friz is tie my hair really tight with a silk scarf while its air drying.

Beeeleven,tcq69r,"How to respond to ""compliments"" on my natural hair&&&I have decided to wear my natural hair open (in an afro) and I have gotten comments from two people saying ""Oh as a child/in the past I always wished to have hair like yours"" and I think those comments are weird and I usually to just awkwardly stand there not knowing how to respond to it. I can't exactly pin points what exactly irks me about that statement. Can someone help me out? Is my reaction to this 100% reasonable or..&&&I had someone insisting on how hard it is to take care of my hair (which it can be but they made it seem like the worst thing ever) and also asking questions as if I couldn't do much with my hair w/o me becoming bold and showing me styling accounts from ppl with Type 3 hair. I do wear my natural hair out often with some exceptions (protective styles), when it comes to styling I can't to bold looks like cornrows but I usually wear it in a high puff, afro, two puffs or low puff, braiding some sections.&&&I don't know others at my school who were discouraged from wearing their natural hair, since I'm the only black student with type 4 hair there except for one girl who could be biracial but has her hair only straightened and we barely cross ways."
Linkin_foodstamps,tcq69r,"Have you ever experienced any ridicule or negative remarks about wearing your natural hair? Do you know of others who were discouraged from wearing their natural tresses or encouraged to ""tame"" their tresses  or wear fake hair? How often do you wear your hair in its natural state? Do you have wide degree of knowledge about natural hair care and styling? The answers to these questions can pin point why you think the person's statement is  strange."

My hair near the back of my neck is very tight almost coiley curls, but the top of my head looks like very loose and almost wider? curls. 

I’m wondering if this is normal or if my hair is growing back less curly on the top because I permanently traumatized it or something. 

Any advice is helpful. TIA."
9shycat,tckqxe,"Best low maintenance hairstyle for labor&delivery?&&&(TLDR at the bottom of post)

I’m currently pregnant and will be giving birth in ~2months. Keeping up with my hair has been a struggle, it’s so much effort 😅 so I want to decide on a hairstyle now so that once I’m near, it’s the last thing I have to think about. 

I have pretty long hair ( 20-ish inches with a wash & go, 26” when dried and stretched) so I was thinking  of having someone do small two strand twists on my natural hair. However, I’m worried it won’t last that long. I need something that lasts through delivery and at least 2 weeks after birth Will two strand twists on my natural hair last 4weeks+ ?

On the other hand I was thinking of getting Faux Locs because they’re cute! BUT I’m worried my hair is too long, so I’ll have to do the cornrow crochet method ( because I don’t think I have the willpower to sit through individual wrapping) so it may not last as long. OR will it? I never had faux locs, so I’m also not sure about the maintenance.

Is there another style that I can keep in that is low maintenance and long lasting? 

TLDR: What is a better long lasting style for labor & postpartum: two strand twists on my natural hair or Faux Locs? Also open to other suggestions for low maintenance and long lasting styles that will last at least 4 weeks.  

I’m really tired all the time and have major pregnancy brain, so I  really appreciate any comments, advice, or suggestions! ♥️&&&I didn’t even think about hair in my face 😬Thank you for the suggestion!&&&Yea I’m leaning towards twist now. Just seems easier"
ASAP4TACOS,tckqxe,"Ghana braids or cornrows! It’ll keep the hair out of your face while you’re taking care of the baby, and they last for 6 weeks for me. They probably could’ve lasted longer tbh! I barely had any frizz by the end!"
MeetTheBrewers,tckqxe,"Two strand twists. That’s how I wore my hair the second time around, easy and low maintenance. When I was in the throws of labor and early postpartum I didn’t care at all what I looked like."
Sam-0808,tckqxe,Definitely cornrows. Easy to put in and take out and your hair will be out of your face. You’ll have more than enough to worry about without the hair stuff lol
cxmareau,tckqxe,"Get some nice cornrows, you wont want a newborn yanking on your hair or hair in the way when you are giving birth."
eramolehans,tckqxe,2 strand twists should also last a very long time. The take down might be tedious depending on how small you go.
kimkellies,tckqxe,I would say braids
milesfromsonic,tckqxe,I vote two strand twists with your natural hair! Easy to pull away from you face. And I might be a little bias but old twists are one of my favorite looks. So effortless and chic.
throwawaytee6,tckqxe,Firstly congrats !! I would just advise to get whatever you want done earlier than your expected due date. I had to get induced two weeks prior than expected and my hair was no where near done and it’s been a challenge. I support something out of the way and easy - cornrows are simple and neat. All the best !
ASAP4TACOS,tci25g,"I did yarn twists not too long ago actually, and I have post with them! Something that helped me get close to the root is using my middle fingers to hold down the yarn while I start the braid. My hair did twist at the root but not to the point where it was painful. I twisted the two individual yarn strands as I twisted them together, which will help them stay together. I think that could also stop it from twisting at the root too much? Either way, it probably will still twist at the root a little. I don’t think a clip will help. Also try to stick to braiding in the same direction (either under or over) and twisting in the same direction (left or right.)"
miiwiam,tci25g,"Yarn Twists&&&I'm trying to figure out how to twist yarn into my hair. I'm starting with a braid but I can't get it close to the root and, when I manage to and start twisting, the whole root twists with it and it gets super tight and hurts… 
(I’ve never done my hair before. I never knew how to braid or even twist my own hair… so I’m learning everything for the first time, really…). 
So, how do you do it without having the root of your hair twist a lot? I tried putting a clip at the root but it didn’t really help… but maybe I put the clip on at the wrong spot? 
Also, I have not great coordination I think because I always get confused about which way I was braiding or twisting and have to start over…
I have severe depression and have never believed in myself about anything so I keep getting really frustrated and sad over not being able to get this right at all :("
AverageGardenTool,tc9f07,"How much heat do you use to get the product to penetrate the hair shaft? Do you use steam or a steamer/heat cap for at least 20 minutes when you deep condition? Sometimes meds can change the way our hair reacts, and many naturals find they need heat or steam for any moisture to work. 

Aslo, if you haven't used a clarifying shampoo (cheapest is VO5 kiwi) in over a month, using one and washing twice could help reset everything. Recommend at least once a month, but not more than 2."
ConstantDownpour,tc9f07,"Extreme Frustration w/ Hair&&&Always dry, wake up dry, end of day dry, natural type 4a hair. 
Not sure if its antidepressants alone, but my hair used to be soft, not hard to the touch. Washing my hair with distilled water doesn't really seem to be doing much. I feel alone in this, because these remedies, masks, deep conditioners seem to just sit on my hair, but not get INTO the hair. My hair feels dry after all of them. Ive been trying to learn how to care for this for years. I'm fed up. I can never get my hair right."
HappyToBeMoi,tc9f07,"Do you know your hair porosity? Where do you live and what’s the climate? I used to have this problem for YEARS, finding out my porosity was life changing because unfortunately the hair does morph depending on where you are. For example in the Caribbean my hair curls and it fully curls in the Eastern Asia countries but everywhere else not so much (I’ve made good use on that American passport). I thought I had low porosity hair because there’s a stereotype that you can’t be born with it but sadly I was and have always had it. It runs in my family. Worse still, I live in New England right by the ocean so double humidity constantly all year due to winter and the beach. I looked like a staticky chia pet once I gave up the relaxers. However my hair game changed when I learned what my hair likes. Protein treatments and reconstructors are the loves of my hair’s life. I have to use them every three weeks followed by a protein free deep conditioner and NOT rinse the deep conditioner out. Basically, shampoo. Then protein treatment left for an hour or two. Shampoo that out with a moisturizing shampoo. Then deep conditioner and leave that for an hour then detangle and proceed. My hair has been thriving and growing like crazy because it’s no longer brittle or staticky. 

The way I deep condition/protein is by doing the greenhouse cap. Just take a grocery store plastic bag and wrap it around your head and tie it at the back of your neck. For one my hair is super long so there’s no cap long enough to grab it all (waist length extremely high density 4AB hair. With no product in it, my hair shrinks to neck length. I hate that it shrinks so much as it also turns stiff, dry and super tangled in that state which makes worse. It turns into what you described here. Hence, I avoid leaving it “out” and un-stretched as that’s actually kryptonite for my hair). Sometimes I go into the wood sauna at my YMCA with it for extra conditioning and my hair is so soft and shiny now. I do this every three weeks and style my hair in two strand twists because anything else is a waste of time in my head. The twists avoid the hair from tangling and I can also make eons more styles from it. From the long twists I can do buns, half-updos, French braids, all sorts of ponytails, waves, chignons…all the styles you could imagine to do on long straight hair I can do on my hair with the extra advantage that type 4 hair doesn’t need hair spray to hold a style. I’ve learned to make magic out of my hair by using doing what it wants to do and avoid what it doesn’t. The twists also makes it easy to wash my hair from them and not spend hours on them. Plus it suits my look, it makes me look like Merida from Brave with the variety of twists. If you need any more help don’t hesitate to hit me up. To give you an idea my hair dries extremely fast when it has no products and takes water fast when it doesn’t have anything either BUT it takes forever to absorb whatever before I apply shampoo to it to remove previously applied products which was why for years I thought I had low porosity. To observe your hair porosity make sure your hair is “naked”. My hair without products is high porosity, getting wet quick and drying up quick and tangling. With product, it acts like low porosity: It takes sometimes a day or two to fully dry and about 10-15 minutes to fully absorb water before I deposit shampoo. However, that change is not a bad thing, as it means the products I put in are working and deflecting water and thus tangling. Make sure you fully let your hair absorb water with no shampoo for about 10-15 minutes. This helps the hair slowly and surely soften up and absorb water how it naturally absorbs water, which is slowly. Anything less often risks that the twists/could in each strand aren’t lubricated and thus snap from distress/pressure. The snapping risks causing more tangles. 


My favorite routine is:

Neutrogena Clarifying Shampoo or Shea Moisture for Men Clarifying Shampoo

Affirm Reconstructor mixed with Neutral Protein Filler left for an hour.

Shea Moisture for Men Moisturizing Shampoo

*sometimes for extra gloss BEFORE the deep conditioner: Adore Clear Semi Permanent and moisturizing shampoo after it.

Mielle Mogongo Deep Conditioner 

Mielle Pomegranate and Honey Leave In

Mielle Pomegranate and Honey coiling custard.

World of Curls Activator Gel

*Extra points: I add Blue Magic grease to the ends in Winter to prevent wind dryness. 

Tools I use: 

1. Hercules Sägemann Magic Star comb to separate and detangle my hair quickly. Like I said, I’m not exaggerating when I say my hair is a massive. I’ve given people heart attacks trying to get my hair done and once caused a lady to twist her wrist trying to blow dry my hair since it’s so thick. This comb cuts my detangling time from two hours with a regular wide tooth comb to about 20-30 minutes. I have hair enough for at least three people, I’m not kidding. This thing is awesome. Have had mine for 5 years now and it still looks as good as new. Costs $20 but worth every penny. It’s also seamless.

2. Tangle Teezer the Ultimate Finisher Brush. It has a handle. This thing is amazing at working product in. It also gets hair that falls but gets stuck in our hair right out safely. I like that the bristles smooth my hair out and deliver product better to each and every kink in the strands. 

3. Tangle Teezer the Ultimate Wet Detangler Brush. Also with handle. I bought this for fun after meeting the first one. I like this one ti detangle but the top one to distribute heavy products like butters. I use them exactly as they say to use them. 

All this seems excessive but they give me the most beautiful, envy inducing but super flexible and healthy hair you can imagine. They protect my hair from absorbing too much moisture from the air and prevent my hair from losing the moisture I did put in. I have been relying on these for the past 2 years. When I have no product my hair looks so pretty and even curls a big instead of puffing out like it did before. When I want to pull off a wash n’ go I have to get under a dryer immediately to prevent it from getting frizz from the moisture trying to escape. I don’t like wash n’ gos because I simply have too much hair and it’s too dense, too thick and too heavy. It’s too much work, too much product and only for it to look good for a few hours since my hair doesn’t curl anyways and never has. It has the Hermoine Hair Problem. The reason why I fell in love with Shea Moisture’s Men’s line is because of the quality for the price, the line is beautiful and smells scrumptious."
