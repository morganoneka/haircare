BabyGothQ,glt4n6,"I can see what everyone else is telling you and I’m firmly in that space as well, but if you MUST straighten it, simply blowdry it. Do some research on the best, safest way to do it. 

Heat protectant, detangling while wet, deep conditioning once a week, twisting it to stretch it, blow drying on low heat. 

There is simply no healthy way to straighten hair. At all. But there are healthi*er* ways. **Only** until she can start embracing her natural hair. So that in the meantime you aren’t completely frying her hair. 

Obviously, my and everyone else’s advice is cold-turkey stop and let her suck it up, but you don’t seem to want to do that, so this a semi-middle ground PLUS will be a way to introduce natural hairstyles like twists, braids, etc. on stretched hair, helping her acclimate to the idea."
ChelsMe,glt4n6,"The first step is getting her to see a lottttttt of very pretty ladies with natural hair. So just, youtube youtube youtube. I'd sit her down in from of the smart Tv and I do her hair with a tutorial so it'd be fun and interactive. Any other media with characters with natural hair would be good!"
candierox,glt4n6,"I'm not a parent, but I second getting to the root of the issue. I was a child who was always told by people and society that my natural hair was ugly and I grew up believing it. It's a generational thing- mom had relaxers so I grew up having them too and it DESTROYED my hair. I look back on yearbook photos and cringe because my hair was so thin and gross. Please please PLEASE continue to tell her that her natural hair is beautiful. Even if you are the only one telling her that, you have to be that person. Straightening our hair is okay every once in a while (I haven't straightened my hair in like 2 years lol) but if you did it multiple times a week, that's literally burning her hair. Our hair is already more disposed toward being dry and using too much heat will suck the life out of it.

You are the caregiver so it's up to you to do what is best for her. Self esteem aside, straightening it a lot is damaging so should only be done every so often IF you are going to continue that. I recommend watching youtube (specifically from black women) to learn about how our hair works. Regarding self esteem, you can see that this starts early. Most people don't understand how important this time period is for children. It may seem like it's just a hair thing- but it's not. I remember hating my skin color and my nose and my hair growing up. I didn't get over for YEARS- until I got to college if I'm being honest. It is really sad. So believe us when we say that even if everyone else is doing whatever, you should really hold your ground on that her hair is beautiful and that it doesn't NEED to be straightened. Even if she throws a fit. Chances are, if she already feels this way about her hair, she probably (unfortunately) has self esteem issues with being black in general (skin color and whatnot). Its not to scare you but it is unfortunately quite common due to societal standards and the environment/community one is brought up in. Of course it may not escalate that much but it's more common than people realize. I recommend watching hair tutuorial videos with girls whose hair looks like hers. Seeing other black women is great and I learned a lot (I love Mahagony Curls and Naptural85 are two popular examples) but their hair curls don't look like mine. I embraced and learned to love my hair when I found out how beautiful mine could be (NaturalMe4c and many others). 

Please be the one to break the cycle. You cant control what happens when she's with others, but you can help when she is with you. Even if she hears from no one else and nothing changes, there will be a day when she remembers what YOU told her.

Also, there aren't a lot of shows with black leads and whatnot but Craig of the Creek on Cartoon Network is an excellent show with a black lead and his family being normal! And one of the characters even rocks her little afro puff. 😂 I second Proud Family (they even address these kinds of things if I remember correctly) and Doc McStuffins is super popular with kids as well.

Best of luck!"
fridayplayyay,glt4n6,"Straightening?&&&Please be nice, I don’t know what I’m doing!

I am fostering an AA girl (7 years old).  I am white, and suck at doing hair.

She is very critical of her natural, curly hair. It is gorgeous! She hates it, and it seems like she’s been taught that her hair is only beautiful when it’s straight.

She is obsessed with having it straightened. I straightened it once and it just seemed really damaging to it, and I don’t think I have the best straightener for it anyway.

She also is not interested in any protective styles or twists... nothing like that.  I have detangler, leave in conditioner, etc... I usually end up putting it in puffs or half way down with a few pony tails along the top.  I let her leave it down sometimes, but it gets very knotted. 

Is it safe to straighten it every so often? Which straightener is best for this? A heat protectant?  I think it was always straightened when she was home (and the ends seem really dry. I’m also getting judgment from mom about how I need to do her hair... and she means straightening... she says to put baby oil on it?  

I appreciate any insight you all may have!&&&I have purchased books that are hair positive and have characters that match her hair, dolls and barbies that look like her... I tell her all the time her hair is beautiful.  I have actually said that line “Your hair is beautiful the way it grows out of your head!” I ask other people to tell her... it is impossible for me to undo her negative association in a small window of time, unfortunately.  And for every positive comment I say about her hair, she has two negative ones. 

She wants “white” people hair, and begs me to straighten it multiple times each week 😞. I feel torn between letting her hair heal, and letting her feel like herself.&&&Thank you for your advice. I already said I wasn’t going to straighten it. My situation is unique, as she’s not my child, and I know she will go back into that environment again and they will continue to straighten her hair.  I think it’ll take years for her to undo the psychological damage from her family.  I’m just trying to make the best of the situation.  I have straightened her hair ONE time since she’s been here, I think you are assuming things incorrectly, like I straighten her hair all the time. I don’t want to straighten it, but want her to feel happy in her skin.  And yes, I understand true happiness comes from inside of ourselves. I was just trying to make a child happy, which is why I reached out for information from people in the know.  Alternatively, I have people on the other side telling me to straighten it anyway, but my first instinct is to not straighten it.&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you! I appreciate your perspective! I knew her teacher would compliment her hair yesterday and I told her to take the compliment and say thank you, instead of droning on with the negative talk. Baby steps!"
irlrllynice,glt4n6,"You need to get to the root of the issue. Continuing to straighten her hair will only strengthen the negative association she has with her natural hair and further tank her self esteem. 

You need to hold firm to the line that her hair as it grows out of her head is beautiful and versatile and perfect in its natural state. When she is firmly in the “‘my hair is beautiful” state, then you can think about safe ways to straighten. Until then, any time you straighten your hair will be damaging to far more than her hair."
biggestswag,glsl5w,help!!&&&[removed]
Guacamole363,glrndc,"I did my own and the first snip is a bit nerve wracking but worth it! Most importantly make sure you use sharp hair shears not ordinary scissors to avoid damaging your hair, then fill a spray bottle with conditioner and water and work in small sections snipping where your straight ends start. 

Depending on how short your transitioned hair is you might need some help with the very back :)"
harrmt8,glrndc,"Big chop during pandemic&&&Using my husband's post (ignore post history).

I've been thinking about doing the big chop for some time now. I would like to move forward with it but salons are closed due to the pandemic.


Has anyone performed the big chop themselves?


Any tips or guides I can look at?


I could also have my husband cut it for me. He has a set of clippers and guards he uses to cut our kids hair. I trust that he can do it."
atctia,glrj4s,"If you want to make that kind of change, your going to have to lighten your hair first. Otherwise to he color won't take."

Glum_Particular,glojip,"Congratulations!!! Depending on how fast your hair grows, it could take about a few months to a year for your hair to hit your shoulders/armpit"
tamoki30,glojip,Been on this hair journey for nearly 30 years and spent only 8 of them natural. Happy nappiversary to me! Finally figured out a consistent routine that works for my tresses so I hope it hits my shoulder/ armpit soon! How long do y’all think that’ll take? 👩🏾‍🦱👩🏾‍🦱👩🏾‍🦱👩🏾‍🦱👩🏾‍🦱&&&&&&Thank youuu!!!

liluzozo,glk3xh,Swimming.&&&Each time that I go swimming should I deep condition after?
petit_aubergine,glk3xh,"if i'm on vacation and swimming in salt water i usually just put coconut oil in my hair and keep it in twists and just rinse my hair when i shower (keeping same twists in throughout my trip). by the end of my vacation i love the texture of my hair when i get home, sand and all :)"
Guacamole363,gljy70,"I transitioned for only 2 months then got impatient with all the tangles and shedding on wash day and cut it! It’s the best decision I’ve made though, I can properly learn my hair and see how it grows, responds and develops on its own. It’s probably the only time in my life I will have my hair this short too so it’s also an experience I’ll never live again as my hair gets longer and longer :)"
Lukasmom,gljy70,I'm transitioning to right now. I didn't want to shave my head so I let it grow out to a point. But let me tell you! Dealing with two different hair types especially one that is damaged is super difficult. You might have the time during quarantine but I'm about to cut. Good luck!
chikn_nuggit,gljy70,I grew out my permed hair in my early teens. It took around 17 months but it was worth it. I was terrified to big chop because I was hella self conscious so I dealt with the two different textures. I recommend growing and trimming your hair gradually until you feel comfortable chopping the rest off and evening out your  length.
devonmoray,gljy70,"I'm been gradually transitioning since September 2019 and I just cut my hair about shoulder length then just cut bits at a time, about an inch every 2-4 months. I liked doing this because my hair seems to look gradually healthier this way and I didn't have to deal with the shock of going bald. Depending on how long your hair is, maybe try cutting 3-6 inches off and gradually cut it overtime?"
iileah772,gljy70,"Transitioning.&&&This may sound stupid but lets say u have heat damaged hair, would it be quicker to big chop or just let it grow out? I’m asking this because once this quarantine is over im planning on getting a haircut.&&&Thank you! Stay safe!!"
jessdaye212,gljy70,"Cutting off the damaged hair is a quick and instantaneous way to get rid of the damaged hair but, your damage may be in different places meaning now your hair is uneven. You might be able to hide or braid the unevenness but it's really up to you. Your hair wont grow any faster. However as a proprietor of regular trims, if you keep up with it, you will experience less breakage (and breakage is why many women think their hair cant grow past a certain length) So it's your choice."
lani97,gljy70,It’s quicker to just cut it off if you don’t care what length your hair is. I’ve been transitioning for the last year because I know I don’t like how I look with my hair being shorter than a certain length.
ticking-time-bombb,gljy70,"I had really bad heat damage last year and I just let it grow out, but it was a pain in the ass. I just made sure to be super gentle so I didn't break off more of my hair. I did blowouts and either kept my hair in a bun or did a braidout using cornrows instead of single braids. I was trimming over time and cut off most of the damage when I was styling like this because it wasn't too noticeable. I started doing wash and gos more often and go tired of the ends so I just cut them off on a whim."
excelzombie,glhp71,"I'm late but I appreciate. I'm going to get some curly ones next, I got some kinky straight ones that were synthetic and I love them love them love them. What took so long??"
petitelypackaged,glhp71,"Yes sis yes. I’m thinking about getting some in 20 - 22 inches so I can have a thick, low puff"
taterthot2k16,glhp71,"Can we pls take a moment to appreciate clip-ins made to match our textures 👌🏾&&&&&&Right!? So glad there are lots of options now. If you can get some human hair kinky straight ones I highly recommend it. The versatility is great and the texture allows them to hold a curl very well&&&That would be fire! These are only 14 inches I think, so 20 would look incredible"

Defeat_your_past,gl9j1w,"You don’t GET free form locs from anywhere. You stop combing your hair, (but obviously still wash it) and just let it grow and be. You can start off using a sponge, but after that you just let your hair do it’s thing and wait. 

It takes patience, but it’s a fun little journey. If you’re looking for something quick to emulate this style, just use the sponge, but it won’t be locced"
Galada-1,gl9j1w,"I would say two strand twist it to how many locks you want. Let it grow out and freeform itself a little( maybe you can semi palm roll it) then, get a lineup and hair cut to your liking. Also, I  usually get this look when I wash my old two-strand twists hair and palm roll after."
TyphoonBoomW,gl9j1w,"HOW do I get this hair?&&&&&&[S](https://i.redd.it/ples6gsoyey41.jpg)orry for shouting, but I asked this to r/BlackHair and r/Blackfellas, but pretty much all they told me is that these are free form locs -\_\_\_-. Thanks, but I want to know HOW to get said free form locs. Also, and I'm sure it'll be more difficult due to Covid 19, but where can I find a loctician to do this for me?

Lastly, I was told I can use the sponge to achieve this, but from what I understand the sponge gives, smaller, shorter, more plentiful curls. Something I'm missing?"
poke-xo,gl9j1w,"My brother got them himself by using his curl sponge alltbevery day. His hair is longer than the guy in the pic, and is twisted up pretty well. He didn’t know anyone who could do it for him 🤷🏾‍♀️"
JamQueen1,gl4jyk,"How do I minimize effects of humidity on my styles&&&Hello I have 4B / 4C hair. 

I am experimenting with my hair and using styles such as perm rod sets, wand curls, flexi rods, curlformers, braid outs, twist outs. 

My issue is that they only last me half a day. I understand that I live in a tropical country, however I am wondering what other naturalistas use to prolong their hairstyles and prevent humidity from ruining the styles.... before they even get to an event ( pre and post Corona times of course) !

Would hairspray help?

 I don't know if I'm comfortable using gel before a wand curl set for example.

For those who use gel, how do you prevent your hair from locking up?"
boldkulturebeauty,gl4jyk,"In humid conditions  our hair has the tendency to draw moisture from the air (especially if the strands are dehydrated). When we use products that contain humectants like (fructose, glycerine, or honey) the hair’s ability to draw moisture is increase resulting in frizz. 

Depending on the style you can consider using products they have anti - humectants in them and  layering gels is also as great option (I would only do this for wash and go styles). For sets like twist out or rod sets you can use foam or cream styler that has hold and remember to let the style dry completely before taking the style down. 

The key for either type of style is making sure the hair is adequately hydrated. This will reduce the hair’s need to draw moisture from the air. Hydrated hair in conjunction with the right products and techniques will allow you to have styles that last longer and can stand up in humid climates.

Anti-humectant gels that work well are Camille Rose curl maker, Tre’Luxe hi definition, and kinky curly curling custard I like to use the on top of uncle Funky’s curly magic to get great definition for my wash and gos and curls that last. A great foam for set is the Doux foam Mielle Organics makes one as well and the Nairobi setting foam works well also."

AnalTattoo,gl1l97,Beautiful!
NotOfThisPlane,gl1l97,How are you wrapping your hair at night? I love my twist outs but I tend to loose the look at night if I don’t wrap my hair correctly.
luvmypurplelipstick,gl1l97,Pretty! How do u like ur hat?
mochigoodness,gl1l97,"My 3 day old twist out&&&&&&Thank you!&&&Last night I just put it on the top of my head and then loosely swirled it into a bun.  It helps not to scrunch it out too much when I first do the twist out.  Every few days I’ll use a spray bottle and dampen it and retwist it, though not as many twists as the first time I do it. I’ll add more products too when I retwist.&&&I like it, the lining really does help, my hair doesn't get ruined because I've been wearing a hat.  I wish they had more colors though, I'd like a white one or dark burgundy."
emmalouweeze,gl1gal,"Not sure if it’s official awkward length but that was a very awkward length for me. 
I would wash my hair and be like okay what the heck do I do now?
I used to slick it down which I really liked while it was achievable... 

But then I got to the awkward and honestly I got braids/weave for months! But try looking up medium length TWA. I’ve seen some helpful videos pop up there!"
ice_meg,gl1gal,guys can someone PLEASE tell me if i’m at awkward length yet or if this is still a TWA 😭 i just need to know what to put into youtube&&&&&&thanks so much ! i’ve been wearing breads a lot up until this point and i was going to try some styles with my real hair but i took my braids out and was LOST 😭
DamaDeGatos,gl0z0m,Totally with you. I love Camille Rose products but have to have less expensive items in the rotation. The other one I use is African Pride Coconut Oil and Baobab Oil Leave In Cream.
TheYellowRose,gl0z0m,Not sure what you consider expensive but I've been using Mielle's pomegranate & honey leave-in for a while with great results
poke-xo,gl0z0m,"What are some inexpensive, but good quality leave-in conditioners?&&&I have been using Camille Rose’s moisture milk, and I love it, but I run through it too fast for it to cost $15 and only be 8oz. I need something bigger/ less expensive!"
themomfriendofthemom,gl0z0m,The African Pride Olive Miracle leave in is less than $3 at Target if you’re really trying to budget and it’s 15oz. It gets the job done
ticking-time-bombb,gl0z0m,I second this. I also recommend the Elasta QP Olive Oil and Mango Butter and Mielle Organics Pom and Honey. The last one is a lil pricey ($13) but its 12 oz and CVS and target has sales sometimes. Or the Mielle website will doa flash sale.
Lovedomi86,gkzcqy,So I did a wash and deep conditioning yesterday morning. So I guess I have to go smaller than what I did before. It’s so close to how I want it to be. Maybe I’ll twist it next week&&&&&&This is my natural hair color
