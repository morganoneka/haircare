oddbrey,ffmzqb,"Keep damaging the front of my hair 🥴&&&So I big chopped last year due to the front of my hair being super damaged from weaves and my hair has already grown to shoulder length. I decided to straighten my hair again to see the length & damaged the front agaaaiinnnn!!!! I know it’s because I didn’t properly moisturize my hair ahead of time, but Is there anyway I can revert it back or should I just wait for it to grow out? 🙄"
zedconus,ffmzqb,Maybe you can incorporate more deep conditioning into your routine. You might just have to wait it out and layoff the heat and do low manipulation styles until your hairline is stronger again. Alot of people recommend JBCO.
conscious_bruja,fflkji,"Only took me a decade to figure out a wash and go routine that works for me, better late than never&&&"
DreadfulLove,fffaon,Once a month or more often.  Starting to just listen to my hair now. It seems not to mind going so long without as long as it’s being co washed at least one a week
PigmentedLady,fffaon,Inconsistent but condition one too two weeks.
k_thewave,fffaon,"How often do y’all shampoo your hair?&&&I’m in the middle of my wash day, and I usually shampoo about once a month. I’m just curious if other people are like me? I find my hair is much healthier when I wash once a month instead of once a week or even once ever 2 weeks"
sunny_bell,fffaon,I wash once a week. Anything more and I feel like crickets are dancing on my head. But I keep my hair really short (I'm a wash and go kind of person).
twixe,fffaon,Every two weeks.

LilRedRid3r,ffcvcm,"Have you changed anything in your process or products lately?
Do you maybe need more protein or moisture?"
PigmentedLady,ffcvcm,"You can: 

•Where an organic satin bonnet

•When moisturized and sealed, where twists 

•Get into the habit of using pure JBCO on the scalp

•Dilute, but get someone to check your scalp to make sure you don’t have any wounds, use Apple Cider Vinegar

• type 4C hair can be difficult to grow in the middle or front of the hair. Keep that braided. 

•Get into the habit of using a old analogy; treat your hair like a flower. That means water it every day or every other day, using sealing oils like pure Haitian or Jamaican Black Castor oil on the hair and scalp, keep it braided and repeat the process. 

•Instead of shampooing, use that when clarifying. Other than that conditioning is best with less drying ingredients.

•Low maintenance styles


In my personal OP I use no weave or wigs to achieve my goal. I feel like in reality it takes some of my moisture and oil and spirituality weave has a connection to its host. If you can avoid weave. The cost, the weight, tightness, searching for less chemically made hair, etc will put a strain on your hair journey."
britt151,ffcvcm,"Keep doing what your doing and also don’t forget to trim regularly. Hair breakage could also be caused by an internal thing, it may be vitamin deficiency or hormone related?"
tree_445,ffcvcm,"Excessive breakage need advice&&&I have shoulder length 4c hair and it’s been breaking off for months now. What are some tips I can use to fix it? I haven’t used heat in 6 months (use it 2-3 times a year to stretch my hair), I wash, condition and deep condition every 2-4 weeks and moisturise when I can&&&I trim a bit more often because the hair is breaking off bad. But I will look into vitamin deficiencies too. Thanks&&&Thaank you so much. I am only seeing this comment now!&&&i haven’t changed products by choice.

_rujeko,ff6m2q,"Rollers on natural hair&&&I have 4c, low porosity hair, almost shoulder length if that matters. I'd like to try out rollers but I have some questions on how to get the best results. I'm not doing it to flat iron the hair afterwards, just to style it in a curled state. Which product is best for definition? Setting lotion? Could I possibly use grease? Does my hair have to be wet, dry or damp? Any specific technique for the most defined results? Any contribution would be helpful, thank you!&&&Oh I understand why it has to be wet and why to stay away from grease. Thank you so much :)&&&Okay, I will check out some tutorials and look for some mousse. Thank you :)"
atctia,ff6m2q,"I'd try it on damp hair, and check out a few tutorials on technique. Many I've seen use mousse for roller sets, and the results look great, but you could also use a curl cream."
stealthpursesnatch,ff6m2q,"You’re talking about a basic roller set? I’d do it on soaking wet freshly-washed and deep-conditioned hair. 

Setting lotion or mousse, rollers, rolling papers, clips, a fine-tooth rat-tail comb and a hood or bonnet dryer are what you need. I would stay away from grease until after it has dried. 

You have to smooth your hair tightly onto the roller, so drenched hair is necessary to create a smooth curl. It takes a lot of practice but a perfect roller set is a thing of beauty."
2oatmeal_cookies,ff3yt6,Pick it out after a wash. Get it shaped up first.
ChelsMe,ff3yt6,"I’d say everyone needs at least a shape up to begin with. Then it’s detangle, condition and wash. You might need a curl sponge with some gel to keep the top in good-looking curls after every wash."
SeminoleDollxx,ff3yt6,"You are gonna have to do work and care for it. Hot oil treatment, wash, and detangle(using a wide tooth comb or a denman brush)

Then do two strand twists all over.

Seriously just watch some youtube vids on Natural Mens channels.

Otherwise cut it off if you arent going to care for it. What's the point in having your coils if you arent going to wear them well just get a fade.

 I wouldnt let my child walk around with matting uncared for hair like this. It's not a good look. 

Cut it or care for it."
badbunnyy7,ff3yt6,"Look up the LOC method. With my daughters hair I co wash, detangle while the conditioner is in there, rinse the conditioner, then do the oil and cream. I like olive oil and Shea moisture products for the conditioner and the curling cream. This keeps her hair looking good for up to 3 weeks. When I notice it’s looking dry I can freshen it up with spray of water, then oil and a cream. Washing and detangling can take up to an hour, but it’s worth it because it lasts for so long. To detangle i use a brush meant for natural hair that I found on Amazon. 

To me, her hair is low maintenance, even though it takes a while to wash and detangle, I don’t have to do it that often. 

Her hair really doesn’t get dirty. Co washing is mostly about retaining moisture and detangling."
blackpino,ff3yt6,"If you're lazy and don't care about your appearance why are you against cutting it?  You can buy some cheap clippers and give yourself a basic cut every 2 weeks or so if going to the barber is what's holding you back.  It won't look cute but at least it will be presentable.&&&If you do care about how you look (which you should, it can really boost your confidence!) and you are just lazy I would say get a shape up and maintain your hair by de-tangling with conditioner in the shower and applying a moisturizing product.  A wild afro can be professional as long as its shaped nicely and not dried out looking.  You can pick it out but I think the textured look would be better for your length."
what_r_u_suggesting,ff3yt6,"Whats the least I can do to manage my hair, for something like a job interview, without cut? I'm lazy&&&https://ibb.co/gjQHzFx

Literally all I do wash it weekly, and sometimes wet in the shower before I leave. I don't really want to care about my appearance, if I'm being honest

If it matters, I have like 2 bold spots on the opposite sides of my front hairline, that you might be able to see

Im 16. Ive never had a real job before, so Im wondering whats appropriate&&&@Seminole thanks for being honest with me&&&I mean, I know it looks terrible. Im just lazy as fuck. I just don't want to be a jobless loser over something like this, that's really it.  

I guess it makes more sense to cut it. Even after the interview I guess that means, caring for it every morning beyond just washing it to not get fired. So if I'm ever seriously looking for a job I guess Ill just do that&&&Seems like effort :<. 

Where do you get a curl sponge? My parents don't know

How much time do you spend detangling is it hard? Im guessing you just straighten your hair with your fingers in the shower

Any gel recommendations? Ive never had gel before&&&Are these products expensive? 3 weeks does sound pretty good though

Only thing, I shouldve mentioned when I go sleep, you probably know how this causes it to get messed up, dust and all that. Does that not happen here? Or do I need to wear a do rag before I sleep?

Would you say the special brush you got is needed?  At first I thought I could detangle with just my fingers, but a person said that takes literal days. I guess Ill lookup how to detangle cause it doesn't seem as straightforward as I imagined, if it takes that long

I appreciate long comments like these, thank you&&&I heard that picking out your hair can damage it overtime and I'm wondering if thats true or not&&&In getting a lot of suggestions, which one do you think is the best?

Yours seems the simpliest. Wash + Pick after shapeup

How often should I shape up?

Thanks for your help&&&Well, maybe that would be an investment? I guess shaving it all off low is pretty basic. I don't go wanna go completely bold though on accident though. I feel like I would mess up and do some dumbshit like that, but maybe I'm overexaggerating. Since I'm thinking about just getting a shapeup and maintaining a small afro, that would probably be a bit harder to shapeup myself

Question, hypotheically, would I got probably fired if I let my hair revert back to shit, in any typical where you work with people in some way? Ignoring the stigma factor. I imagine whoever's in charge would maybe first give me a warning if I had several shitty hair days and eventually let me off. Even if it gets more lenient after you actually get the job, I guess the hair in the photo I gave is really

Getting it shaved low wouldn't be that bad, but I kind of still like the feeling of hair being on my head. 

Ill probably post this on r/job too just to make sure, and post a pic of the time in my life my hair looked decent, and see if I can maintain that. Sorry if this post seems like Im just overthinking this&&&Just to make sure:

You detangle by using a denman brush, you can use only your fingers but that takes longer

Does water in the shower count as moisturizer? Also using conditioner

I can get a ""textured"" look by detangling, by not using a pick? Im a bit confused by what you mean here sorry

Thanks for helping me out"
Crashingshores,ff0of8,"Try compromising with her? I know in principle she should let you be able to leave your hair natural, however that seems to not be an option.

So maybe say you'll wear your hair under wigs or continue to wear your hair in braids? Or threaten to shave your head if she does force you to perm it and then she would have wasted her money."
DreadfulLove,ff0of8,"Tell her she’s making you feel hatred to your natural hair because you can tell that’s what she’s trying to get you to believe by her actions. Tell her it hurts your feelings when she implies her hatred of your hair. Tell her it’s hard for her to love your hair and be proudly [black] because she’s finally come to understand that not even her mom is proud.

Just make her feel like shit for her controlling your hair and being prejudice."
LilRedRid3r,ff0of8,"Can you grab a family member that she'll listen to? This is kind of ridiculous, I mean, what an unnecessary fight to have with your child for no reason. I'm in the car with my mom right now (I'm an adult) and we're talking about how absurd it is that someone wants to have a fight over hair when there are so many more important things happening in life right now.
I didn't stop relaxing my hair until college, but she said she never would have forced me to keep getting them because it's strange to want to have control over someone else's hair.

I don't recommend a lot of the physical stuff that has been mentioned here, my mom would've whooped me, but maybe if you can get another adult to speak to her, she'll listen. I'm sorry you have to do that in the first place because she's not just listening to you."
SeminoleDollxx,ff0of8,"Sis u better out your foot down.

Stand up for yourself and refuse to sit down so she can apply it!!"
TeaLover315,ff0of8,Don’t let her do it
britt151,ff0of8,"I started doing my hair alone when I was in 4th grade. Around the age of 9/10? Just tell your mom you can handle it from here. Natural hair is beautiful and tell her you’d like to take care of it from now on. If you’re transitioning, look for transitioning styles on YouTube and tutorials on how to care for natural hair. Caring for your natural hair is really fun! Don’t let your mom put a relaxer in your hair, it will just break off and damage your hair. Good luck!"
cassimonium,ff0of8,"Shave or cut it, and tell her you tried to relax it yourself (to save her time of course!) but you left it on too long and it all broke off.
ETA or if you can pull money together, ask her to take you to a professional (you pay) and see if you can pull them aside an explain your situation. Maybe they can talk your mother out of it. Sometimes it takes a professional to get through to people."
d0ntreadthis,ff0of8,"I agree, but I'd get mad beatings if I tried that as a kid or teen 😅"
dleifmurb,ff0of8,"my mom is forcing me to relax my hair.&&&I’ve have continuously had braids for the past year and half. before then, my hair was so unhealthy and relaxed. i hated how it looked. i hated taking pictures because of how it bad it looked. Fast forward to now and my mom said that I need to take a break from the braids. We did, and of course my hair is natural now. I would like to experiment with it but she keeps flat ironing and hot combing it. She’s just creating damage that we reversed with the braids. She won’t even let me do my own hair. I’ll attempt, and then she’ll take it down and do it the way she wants. and i hate how she does it. Now she’s bought a relaxer and said that my opinion on the matter is invalid, when it’s literally my hair. i’ll have to deal with the consequences of relaxed hair when i leave the house in 2 years. I don’t want to go back to my insecure self before the braids, but i’m afraid it’ll happen."
eebee8,ff0of8,"Don’t let her do it — you’re (presumably) 16, not a toddler. 
Fair game if she doesn’t like your hairstyles, but she can’t force you to do anything. It’s hard but you need to put your foot down."
graceyperkins,ff0of8,"Can you try talking to her? She needs to realize that trial and error is the best thing for you to learn to do your own hair. 

I understand the braid issue. She may be worried about your hairline from the constant stress. My daughter wants to wear braids more often, but I don’t let her more than three times a year. When she gets older (12 now), she can make that choice. My job is to get her to adulthood with as much of her original equipment attached as possible. It’s tons easier for me to straighten her hair, but I understand that isn’t her preference. She recently had a DevaCut, and really took to the stylist’s advice. While I’m not 100% pleased all the time, I respect her journey. 

All that to say- maybe you could find a third party? It could give you some direction that mom may feel you’re lacking and let mom ease up on the reins a bit. Not necessarily DevaCut cause it was stupidly expensive plus the products."
iamighty,ff0of8,Do you have anyone in your family who is natural who can advocate for you? I'd say just don't let her do it but it might not be that simple. Have you explained to her the damage that heat and relaxers cause? I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope it gets better.
iridescentleandra,ff0of8,"this sucks. but honestly what is she gonna do, make you sit in a chair while she physically forces a relaxer on you? I'm assuming you're about 16 because you say you're leaving home in two years. If it's to the point where she literally forces hair styles on you its probably a good idea to leave. Hopefully you have a concrete plan for that so you don't have to go back. 

If I were you I'd do a big chop. But that's just me and my rebellious self lol I cut my all my hair off because my older sister kept trying to tell me how to do it (and I was 25 at the time) and it was the best decision I ever made. I know short hair isn't for everyone but if it's the only way for you to have some control and to keep her from trying to relax it then that's what I'd do."
itreallyisofinterest,ff0of8,Is this a role for your Sims character or are you serious? Just asking.
meqek,ff0of8,"My mom was like that!  She was so bad to the point when someone gave me birthday money she forced me to go to a salon and get a relaxer. I wasn't able to safely transition until I left home around 21/22. Best advice I can offer is dependent on her personality.  If you have a way to make your own income, set aside money for braids and tell her you'll pay for it.  Or if she's got a relative you can trust, go to them and plead for their assistance (like an Aunt or a close friend or something) in talking to her."
micahbananaz,ff0of8,"You're gonna have to stand up for yourself or you'll never learn how. I know it's scary because it's your mom, but she loves you and at 16 should be treating you like a young woman, not a child. Like someone else said, she can't force you to sit there while she puts harmful chemicals on your hair."
silky_link07,ff0of8,"Honestly, if you are leaving in a couple years, why would she continue to do your hair? Is she going to keep doing your hair once you graduate and get on with your life? This is the best time to take over your own care. I can’t tell you how to handle it, I’m not in your shoes. I don’t know how your mother will react to your asserting some control over your own routine. But at some point she has to back off. How long will you be without the braids? If your hair is unhealthy, talk to her about chopping off the bad parts right before you get the braids redone. Is there anyone in your family who is natural that can stand up for you?"
sunny_bell,ff0of8,"I personally would shave my head as a big ""screw you and your stupid hair rules!"" But I'm also 30 and so my perspective is a bit different.

In all seriousness you're 16 (I'm guessing) not six. Talk to her and explain that it's your hair and you want to look after your own hair. Have that conversation about what you want and need. Assuming you're a minor you do live in her house and are beholdenden to her rules but you're also big enough to have a calm rational conversation with her about your hair. Regardless of age you do have a right to bodily autonomy, full stop."
Sophs_B,feyimj,I live in the UK; I don't tip my hairdresser.

haireveryshare,feyimj,"10-25% depending on quality, experience..and whether I wanted to patronize them again.  Start at 15%/$30.  But if you really like their work and want to use them again I would go for $40 or $50."
stealthpursesnatch,feyimj,Twenty percent.
CurrentConclusion0,fewbbg,Best curly hair routine for beginners&&&
Lixlo,fetbk6,Ive never seen this policy before but I think it’s kind of ridiculous if they think that a person’s hair will stay completely undetangled before they get there. They are already paying them so they can take a few minutes to comb it out. And I do think that they are trying to keep some people with coarser thicker hair out because they already see that kind of hair as “nappy”.
Razlover88,fetbk6,"I think they do this because some people come with extremely tangled hair and get mad at the stylist if they think they're being too rough. We have to be realistic about this. Natural haired women are more difficult to work with, not because our hair texture is difficult but because we can be difficult. 

The first time I get my hair braided after going natural I was furious at the woman combing my hair. From my perspective, my hair was being torn out. Now I realize it wasn't and that the women knew what she was doing but at the time I wasn't having it. 

By requiring that you arrive detangled they avoid the BS we often dish out and they protect themselves from being blamed for certain things. We all have different hair textures but some of us (me) have super naps that are hard to get out without causing a little pain but again it feels different when you do it yourself rather than a stylist, or beautician&&&I understand this policy because many people will show up at the salon with crazily unkempt hair then will get upset at their hairstylist if they ""pull too hard "" or whatever peo0ple complain about. I think this is a good policy because as a natural haired women I am extremely cautious when another person is handling my hair, and if I feel they're being too rough whether they are or not doesn't matter I'm gonna think there ripping my hair out because it feels different when someone else is doing it, even when they're doing it properly it just doesn't feel right. businesses with this policy are just protecting themselves because not only is a natural haired woman harder to please but you have to admit, detangling can be a difficult, long tedious process if its long and thick. it's just easier and safer for clients to detangle themselves"
Sophs_B,fetbk6,"I've seen this policy. For me the key is in the interpretation of ""detangled"".

For example, if you washed (and detangled) your hair 4 days ago and have had it in a bun ever since, my silk press lady would be fine with that.

If you've had your hair in braids/extensions for 3 months, _you_ need to do the work. (Perhaps this is an extreme example, but I definitely think it's a judgement call as to where the line of acceptable amounts of tangle is.)

Personally, I don't wanna risk someone else tugging at and breaking my hair. Even if it's not a case of them being heavy handed, if they don't use a detangling technique that works for me, I need them to leave my knots alone! So I'll wash my hair a few days before and braid it like I'm getting ready for a braid out. Then I'll undo it while I'm on the train on my way to her.

A few days of looking like Celie from The Colour Purple just adds to the butterfly reveal!"
clocke3,fetbk6,"What do you guys think?&&&I wanted to ask your opinion on something I keep seeing in the natural hair community. 

I was looking up places online close to me to get my hair silk pressed in the future. I came across one natural hair salon that had a detangle policy. The policy states that you have to come with your hair detangle before your appointment. If not, your appointment will be canceled. 

I was curious about anyone else’s opinion on this. I have been seeing this at multiple salons lately and this kinda upsets me. Obviously I can go to another salon that doesn’t care, but to me it kinda gives the impression that 1) they don’t want to work that hard on your hair even though it’s kinda their job, and 2) it may be stigmatizing people with coarser textures. I have 4b, primarily 4c hair and even after I detangle, it will tangle in a short amount of time.&&&I agree with you that it’s up to interpretation. I would just feel bad if they legit wouldn’t do anyone’s hair if they did detangle earlier and just got tangled on the way there&&&Now i didn’t see it as a liability thing, which i understand. But i feel like detangling overall is not hard for someone else to do if done right.&&&I agree with you, extremely untangled hair is unbelievable and I sympathize with hair stylists who have to deal with that. I think for me I took it as a hard cut interpretation of detangled hair. Or at least add an extra fee for detangling purposes, that would be more efficient."
stealthpursesnatch,fetbk6,"Detangling takes time and time is money. Someone coming in with a mop of tangled hair could add 20-40 minutes on to the time required to style the hair. That time doesn’t come from thin air. It either pushes back the start time of the people behind them or means the stylist has to stay later than they attended. 


I’m sorry, but it isn’t the stylist’s job to detangle your hair as part of a regular straightening service. It would never cross my mind to show up with two weeks of tangles in my hair. That work needs to be done by you before you get there. A few tangles is probably fine. A whole destroyed head of hair and knots — come on!"

montero19,fer5az,"My first ever twist out, i did it all myself! What you guys think?&&&&&&I twisted (2 strand twisted) my hair by sectioning, spraying on water, putting on leave in conditioner, and oil then twisting. You can just water to take out when it fully dries but i just left it like that for a week cuz i was wanted a break from my hair picking. Anyways. Then i rubbed oil on my hand (to prevent frizz) and untwisted by twisting them in the opposite direction and then pulling apart. Then i separates them to the desired thickness. Sprayed alittle spritz revitalized( basically a moisturizer, leave in, etc. Just spritz bottle form) and hopped in  to a hot shower with a lot of steam and BOOM! Twist out complete.

Side note: Honestly this would have looked like a fail without the steam from the shower that really filled out my hair. Steam is the GOAT. And i finger coiled the ends to finish the twist in the beginning

Products i used: As I am leave in conditioner, JBCO,  suave gold series frizz reducing refresher spray, and  H2O😁"

BegoniaShawty,feh1kh,do you think it could be product buildup that is leaving your hair with less curl? do you use a clarifying shampoo regularly?
garrisvn,feh1kh,"tips on restoring curls?&&&i’m not sure of my hair texture, i’d say its 4A or 4B. it used to get super curly, but now at best, a few sections have very light curls and the rest is frizzy and sticks up right after a wash day. my hair is all natural. it is low porosity.

- i use suave moisturizing shampoo and conditioner on wash days and use doo grow’s “intense petetrating conditioner” to deep condition my hair. i used to use cantu’s moisturizing curl cream, a castor oil moisturizer, and eco gel to style my hair, but these no longer work the same for me. they seem to dry out my hair quicker.

does anyone have any tips/suggestions on how to restore my hair? or possibly any good products/routines on how to get my hair back to its best state possible?"
