Anime-noodle,rf7o3c,First time trying wetline gel and I’m not mad&&&&&&Thank you!&&&Thanks 😊
GoodyOldie_20,rf7o3c,That shine and definition! 👍
Right_Surprise5369,rf7o3c,Looks great! A lot of definition and shine.
SkepticBrother,rf7o3c,"
Pretty fire!"
dizzyexplorer22,rf7o3c,That came out really nice!!
Glum_Situation1322,rf74hk,I usually get mine from Walmart
InternalCompetitive9,rf74hk,**Shea Butter Market** does wholesale with there sister company which is the leading distributor of unrefined shea butter from northern Africa. I buy this shea butter and it's the best quality we have ever seen. My sister has a private label shea butter company and was able to private label through [Shea Butter Market](https://sheabuttermarket.com/) as well. Highly recommended!
Keyara2k,rf74hk,Where to buy pure Shea butter and black castor oil?&&&Anybody know any good links or online shops that sell quality Shea butter or black castor oil? I’ve been told not to buy from the local beauty supply stores.&&&Thanks for sharing! I’ll definitely check them out.
MicheLu242,rf74hk,Natural food stores
Dangerous_Relief_13,rf6fxe,Oils and butter debate ?&&&What is your opinion on using oils and butter or not using it ? I feel like my hair has changed for the better from not using oils.
DotHOHM,rf6fxe,My hair likes to be coated in a heavy sealent. I don't have edges without it. But I wash my hair a lot (swimming) so I don't let anything sit for more than 3 days and keeping water out is an important part of my haur care.
Neisha_with_a_T,rf6fxe,My hair feel ten times better without oils and butters. I slowly took myself off of it and then finally went by a natural hair specialist to get a cut and product recommendations. My hair has been thriving and wash days are much easier and shorter.
Taaaahh98,rf6fxe,I’ve gone back and forth between using oils and not using them because I haven’t had access to my regular products. I found when I started using oil in my hair again I had so much buildup and my hair felt really dry so I’ve just been moisturizing it in the shower with a hair masque and letting it air dry.
ggogh,rf6fxe,I tried it but my hair felt sooo dry . I think it just depends on your hair honestly.
CarribbeanTSBeauty,rf6djg,I got in micro links and I’m high key praying once I wash my hair my curls revert back w/ no heat damage. Has anyone used olaplex products before ? Do they really work ?&&&
TORONTOFOODJUNKY,rf5s74,Looks great!

Appropriate_Humor598,rf12lw,"I always detangle with shampoo, it gives me more slip than conditioner"
EloquentElixir,rf12lw,If the shampoo is moisturizing enough/gives you good slip I don't see the problem. Detangle at whatever step is easiest for you
Neisha_with_a_T,rf12lw,I detangle with just water before I shampoo and again with conditioner after shampooing. If detangling with shampoo works for you then keep at it .
Scream_Pueen,rf12lw,If it works for you then it should be fine.  I used to detangle when I rinsed conditioner out under water.  Anything before that point hurt and was difficult.
khaila_,rf12lw,"i usually detangle my hair while there’s shampoo in it and i run through if again before washing out the conditioner. for me, it’s a way to assure that i get all knots out. i haven’t had any issues with my hair by doing so."
nightmooth,rf12lw,"I don't think it's bad , at least I guess it depends . I know it will not be beneficial for me because I will have to detangle it again after. It's my last step."
nonethelessnine,rf12lw,Is it bad to detangle your hair with shampoo when washing your hair?&&&I be trying to find easier ways to detangle my hair when it's wash day. and I always see people detangle their hair with conditioner but never with shampoo and they never explained if it's okay to comb your hair when theres shampoo in it.  Is it bad? Does it rip out your hair and cause more breakage? Can anyone explain this to me
amariwashere,reyqtv,Thank you to whoever recommended a protein treatment to me for my bleached hair❤️ my hair feels as soft and moisturizered as it did before&&&
Lacasadelmango,rewjet,I did the same exact thing :( the jar is so big
Latii_LT,rewjet,"Give them out to friends, if I just personally don’t like them but they get the job done I might use the for specific things like when I braid my hair up. If the product is awful I just throw it in the trash."
Neisha_with_a_T,rewjet,I give them to my mom who uses them in her relaxed hair or my little cousin.
ZauhBuggati,rewjet,"I just throw them away or give them to someone. You’re gonna make the money back anyway, if you do decide to throw them away 🤷🏾‍♀️"
flirtandflutter,rewjet,"If you have a buy nothing facebook group near you, you could try posting it there for someone who needs it."
jclassic100,rewjet,I try to give them away. Hair companies should be ashamed the way they refuse to make samples
justfloating_,rewjet,I either give them away if they’re not used  and not close to expiring. Or I use them for my wigs. Sometimes some are just so bad I just throw them out.
micahelise,rewjet,getting rid of products&&&what do you guys do with your almost full/barely used hair products? i feel like throwing them in the trash is such a waste but i don’t know what to do with the products that just didn’t work out for me :(&&&didn’t think of this one! thank you!&&&it would be amazing if samples became the norm!&&&example: i tried the xtreme gel for a wash & go but it didn’t work so i just have this massive jar taking up space
revientaholes,rewjet,"When you do a ponytail or something of that kind, nothing elaborated and easy to go, you could use some leave ins to give your hair a nice smell or use gel for your edges or to define your ends"
yuppalsilk,reurcr,do silk pillowcases help hair?&&&[removed]
hinahatesyou,resrar,"color wax&&&i really wanna dye my hair a new color but i definitely don’t wanna bleach it, so i’ve been thinking about trying color wax. 

i want to know if it’s good for curly hair cause i’ve heard things about clumping and it looking kinda clay like. does anyone have any tips for how to apply it? also, how long does it typically last?"
nurdbird,resrar,I’ve never tried color wax but As I Am just released a color gel for curly girls and it comes in like six very generic colors but it’s really cool because I have really dark hair and it still works even with the blond! It’s not permanent if washes off but it’s such a fun way to get a new look without breaking the bank or ruining your hair
popcornnhero,resrar,"I’ve tried it and it does take up well in my hair, but it stains everything it comes in contact with. I also noticed that my hair feels like a wire after I take it out so I stopped using them. It does look a bit chalky when it dries though. I think it is more suited for a one day deal."
Curious_Ciara,rermn1,Have you tried using a blow dryer with a comb attachment? It helps helps to loosen up your hair so it will be easier to style
dreamboogie,rermn1,Scarves/headwraps on days when I don’t feel like looking at my hair work wonders for me. Esp paired with some cute earrings.
fangstar08,rermn1,"I don’t know what to do with my 4c hair&&&I have short 4c hair. I’ve been going natural for years (I’m a senior in high school). I’ve worn box braids and I’m going to start my loc journey soon-but in my school, no one has hair like mine. I don’t know what to do. every time I put it in a style, I hate it. I had it in an afro, it looked fucking horrible. 

My mum keeps saying it looks good and fine, but people say it’s “nappy”. I shaved it in sophomore year-or did the big chop, as I couldn’t deal with it. now since I’ve grown it out, I still don’t know what to do with it. And honestly It causes my BDD to spiral out of control, especially since my hair doesn’t go with my face shape. please help."
Beaniepies,reqvx4,I guess this is what I get for letting my hair get matted up 🤦🏾‍♀️…there was so much breakage I wanna cry&&&&&&I haven’t combed it in a while but the breakage is still concerning to me 😅&&&I did finger detangling first and then I used a wide tooth comb
Dandie24,reqvx4,"Tbh, that’s not bad at all. We shed 50-100 hairs everyday. Also, did you have a protective style in?

Just try and do hair masks if you feel like your hair is not thriving."
Deecw79,reqvx4,"Don’t feel bad, this really isn’t a lot of you said it was matted. I lose WAY more after taking out my braids. Looks like I can make a wig!"
Emmaudofia14,reqvx4,At least you removed the matted hair. We all go through stuff some times. Well done for admitting it. Your hair will flourish and thank you x
KEnyinna,reqvx4,Next time spray with water then apply a good detangling conditioner like Kinky Curly Knot Today then comb from ends to roots in sections while using a wide tooth comb.
Miriam-Esi,reqvx4,What do you detangle with
Tough_but_fragile,reqvx4,"What’s you’re wash day like? I usually partially detangle my hair while I’m conditioning, then I don’t do the rest until I’ve sat under a heated dryer for my deep conditioning."
a-midnight-flight,reqvx4,It will grow back. You should give yourself credit for removing the matted hair.
amariwashere,reqvx4,ok honestly this ain't bad lmaooo i would have two hand fulls of hair when i detangle sometimes becuz of how badly i was taking care of my hair :(
bat_chic-crazy,reqvx4,That's it? Lol I don't mean to sound insensitive but honestly imo I don't think you have to worry too much. If it was full on breakage then yeah. But this seems normal for a wash day.
chakra_kitty,reqvx4,That’s not bad. Sadly I’ve had worse 🥴
jonin_jass,reqvx4,"If your hair is dense, this amount is okay."
oncheedoe007,reqvx4,How did u detangle it?
peachismose,reqvx4,This was the amount of shedding I had when I detangled after braids so I feel like this is fine!
pettyminaj,reqvx4,Girl this isn’t bad! When my shedding was bad you could make a small dog out of my hairfall
thefirstrastabarbie,reqvx4,"It may seem bad at first, but just take a deep breath. Remember to use a moisturizing product with slip on soaking wet hair, good detangling brush (what are you using now?), and a patient approach in small sections when detangling."
uhyeaokay,reqvx4,"This isn’t too bad the same happens to me. Especially if I don’t comb my hair or have a protective style. 
Do you detangle before you wash your hair? I part my hair into four sections and then wet it and add some leave in conditioner and gently comb the sections out. It makes shampooing so much easier."
weaboo801,reqvx4,I wish I only shed this much. I get multiple ones like that every week

Eastern_Jury_3796,renqw2,"How do you get hair to grow past your shoulders?&&&I've been natural my entire life, my hair is 3c/4a low porosity. My hair never grows past my shoulders, when i trim it, it grows back but doesn't go any further. I don't know why because it is healthy, i never use heat. I deep condition my hair every week and my hair is currently in knotless braids as I read that protective styles help hair growth. Any tips to get hair past shoulder length?&&&Any tips?"
Misisme20,renqw2,Protective styles can help you leave your hair alone so it can grow. Hair grows on average I think 0.5 inches a month. Maybe try drinking more water and healthy foods
XasiakittyX,renqw2,you may not be retaining length
Certain-Year-5367,relyd7,"My hair can’t do this, it shrinks into half the length after wash."
TammyFacey,relyd7,"Wash + go and care less, who’s with me?!&&&&&&Thank you but what do you mean, can’t do it? X&&&My hair is about 30% still damp here! My point was I know it will shrink and reduce more, but I’m past caring! Yknow xx"
Tough_but_fragile,relyd7,My hair can’t do that lol. But the look is great on you! ✨
IntelligentTrifle9,relh96,1st time retwisting myself. I use Jamacian black castro oil infused with Rosemary and my girlfriend styled it. How does it look?&&&&&&Thanks!
Krrystal,relh96,It looks great 😊.
blakppuch,rekorj,"Crochet extensions delivering to EU/Ireland?&&&Hey! Does anyone know a site where I can get extensions bar Amazon and etsy(I just don’t find what I want there). Most of the sites I find are only delivering to the US/Canada.

 I’d appreciate any suggestions! Thanks in advance.&&&That’s a really good idea! Thank you"
la_1999,rekorj,"Do you know any black European hair YouTubers? If you watch a couple of their videos you might be able to figure out where they get products and/or extensions. I don’t know any but that’s what I do when I’m trying to figure out where to buy things around me. Sometimes I even DM them on Instagram, they might reply"

I didn't know my hair could do this! Also thought my hair was all fine but turns out I'm medium to fine. And it was nice just talking about hair care. I loved it lol it's just expensive, gonna be a maybe twice a year thing&&&Thank you <3&&&I'll let my cousin know 😂 it's her bathroom&&&Thank you <3&&&Thank you! I found the one I went to in Atlanta, Georgia. I think there is a directory somewhere for people that are trained for this.&&&Thank you! It is someone skilled in cutting (in its natural state) and working with curly/kinky textures. I do have a regular stylist that I go to cause she's cheaper and I'm fine with a straight cut.  I went for the experience and I'll probably go once or twice a year to the specialist.&&&Thaaaank you <333&&&Thank you <333&&&They used devacurl plumping primer, innersense I create hold, and oasis hydrating primer on clean hair.  I bought the devacurl plumping primer but I'm going to try it with other products that I already have when I try to recreate this style.&&&Thank you <33&&&Devacurl plumping primer 
Oasis hydrating primer 
Innersense I create hold 

On clean hair with raking and sectioning&&&Preciate it <333&&&Thank you doll <3&&&It's actually a gel mix that's set in a wash n go or wash n define lolol but yes even though I don't really like the curl typing chart&&&Thank you <3"
Regret-this-later,regnok,Unrelated but I love that shower curtain.

cam_wats,regnok,Your hair looks so healthy and defined !!!! This is beautiful!
curious-turtle,regnok,Beautiful!!!! What curl pattern do you have? I’m curious if I categorized mine correctly  ….
gellybaby94,regnok,I have a very similar texture waiting this length what products you use for definition
hey_effie_hey,regnok,Aren’t qualified pros the best!? My first time seeing their results with my wash n go blew my mind!
lashawn3001,regnok,Did she give you the name of all the products she used?
marskie,regnok,Beautiful!
mochigoodness,regnok,"Curl specialist, is that a term that's freely used or is it a specialty?  A curl specialist that is skilled specifically in curlier textures would be a great find.

Your hair looks beautiful!"
penguincatcher8575,regnok,Beautiful!!!! Where were you able to find a specialist?? I’ve been looking in Detroit area for so long and can’t find anyone I love
xCelestial,regnok,Oh yours looks like mine! (esp when wet and air drying haha) 4b sort of mix goin on right?
yerikasalt,regnok,You hair it's so beautiful omg
ButterflyNTheSky,reejyf,Aside from the Olaplex system...TGIN Rose Water Leave-in conditioner + African Pride Rose Water & Aragon oil Curl Mousse for wash n go's smells devine and gives great definition. I like Design Essentials holding foam as well.
GoldenGoddessPisces,reejyf,"Water, Cantu Curling Cream & Sweet Almond Oil. If I want more definition add Wetline extreme. That’s it. Smh. I’ve spent thousands of dollars over the years trying products from everywhere & this is what works for me. This is it. Perfect curls & easy detangling every time. ☺️❤️‍🔥"
GoodyOldie_20,reejyf,"Share your ""holy grail"" styling product combo (and how long it took you to find it).&&&&&&I agree on the def vs. hold and the need for both. I'm loving Design essentials avocado leave in and curl creme for def, and a small amount of Taliah waajid apple aloe Gelle for a medium hold and to tame flyaways. Took me about 4 mos..just went natural in Aug and have tried so many products have. I have the UFD travel set and can't wait to try it!😊&&&Just tried the UFD and it is bomb! I felt like it went on with very little slip but dried with the perfect amt of moisture,  def, and shine. Wow!&&&Ditto on the SM conditioners! I have been lucky to find a few on clearance at TJMaxx.&&&Very basic indeed. I am trying to avoid the TRY EVERYTHING trap. 🤑&&&I really like the TGIN Rose Leave in too. I am SO not trying to test out all these products and now I want to try the African Pride you mentioned. It will take me forever to use what I already have on my short hair.&&&Thanks! I need to look for the. Ecoslay. I haven't seen it. I hear good things about Miss Jessie's.  Lord, it will take me 2 years to try these products...but it's kinda fun! I just can't resist seeing how the different ones work. And, I have 3 naturals in the house so I will share. 😊&&&I like your variety and results. I was curious about the Doux. I haven't seen cocoblack in my area. Where to look?"
Missgenius44,reejyf,"For me it’s been cocoblack gives a serious hold. Found months ago. 
The Doux big poppa used this since October and curls stay for daysss

Mane choice glaze used last week and curls were popping 

Aphogee curlizer yesss juiciest curls ever. There are more. But these I love so far.   

Lot that has helped is having a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. So it enhances your curls."
XasiakittyX,reejyf,garnier fructis curl shaping jelly is amazing for my 4a hair fine density hair. my hair hates thick butters and oils cus it dries my hair out so I opt for products that are lightweight. I also love shea moisture deep conditioners
ayiekobaby,reejyf,"Not a styling product, but Vatika is an amazing deep conditioner for my (4c) hair!"
dreamytealuv,reejyf,"Aunt jackies quench leave-in
MCJW on point twist cream
Aussie Coils Curling Jelly or Suave Naturals Serum Gel

Ive been using this particular combo for about 2 years. I used to struggle with sealing in moisture, so I used to use JBCO as a sealant. Then I randomly decided to use a light gel which worked much better. 

My hair stays moisturized for about a week and a half like this. I ussually wear my hair in flat twists, but when I take them out on wash day, they're still very defined."
happyhippoking,reejyf,"A jelly like Uncle Funky's Daughter for curl definition and moisture & a hard hold gel like Eco, Wetline or Pattern for longevity. Jellys give me great curls but no hold and hard hold gels give me hold, but stringy dry curls. Took me forever to realize I could just double gel because there's no rules in haircare."
kelthuzad12,reejyf,"Ecoslay has been my jam! Found out about it in October of this year lol. Before I'd tried all the common products: Aunt Jackie's, Cantu, Aussie, etc, but my hair just wasn't working lol.

Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic is a runner up for stylers, but not enough hold on its own, but it might work out once my hair grows a bit."
AshlandSouth,red035,Super cute
