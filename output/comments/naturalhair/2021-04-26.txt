2noserings,n3hf7q,"should i loc my hair? i’m just wondering if it would look better than my natural fro. (i would like for only Black people to answer, thanks!!)&&&"
AshirahYah,n3hf7q,"I love your fro!!! I started my locs from a huge afro. It's been a year and 3 months since. 
If you want too start locs, jump in; if you are unsure, keep pickin'!🖤🖤🖤🖤"
Ashtothelight,n3hf7q,I'm pro fro also. I'm trying to get mine to be the same length as yours. Locs feel so committal. I like being able to do protective styling on my hair if I get bored of a look.
DoubllW,n3hf7q,"Ugh this is literally so gorgeous, I think you would look just as amazing with locs. How do I make my fro like this?"
Holiday-Plankton,n3hf7q,I love your fro! Maybe try 2 strand twists or faux locs to see how you like the style
ItsOnlyKaren,n3hf7q,I would say keep the fro. I wear an afro for the most part but all last year i wore faux locs. They are fun and you get the option to remove them.
KnightsBal,n3hf7q,Keep the fro!  Do not loc away that volume
Late-Kaleidoscope660,n3hf7q,It's the fro for me!!!
Lightly_Tatted,n3hf7q,Loving the fro 😍
One-Fifty_150,n3hf7q,"That fro is literal hair goals! Exactly what I want mine to look like one day. I would personally keep the fro, but I bet you'd look great in locs too"
Optimalillusionist,n3hf7q,"So I’m not black, but I would like to answer, even though it says you would like only black people to answer; your hair looks gorgeous. The fro is perfect on you and locs would look great too."

anxydutchess,n3hf7q,Your hair looks beautiful! Do what your heart tells you 😌
atctia,n3hf7q,To our fro is so cute! I would suggest getting faux locs to get an idea on how you might like locs. But whatever you decide I'm sure will be gorgeous
babydo11_,n3hf7q,Fro for sure!! Locs are beautiful but I’d recommend getting faux locs instead. That way you can have more versatility to your hairstyles. Once you get locs permanently its a lot harder to go back. Plus your fro is absolutely perfect and suits you soo well
beautifuljess1,n3hf7q,I love the fro 😍😍
gidgetcocoa2,n3hf7q,Nah. Let your fro stay free.
girl-w-glasses,n3hf7q,keep the fro!! It’s hard to give my feedback on what locs would look like since I’m not sure what you’ll look like with them. Buttttt this fro is everything! 😍
mdhk7,n3hf7q,"Sis, I WISH my hair looked like that and am only considering locs myself because it's the only way to retain length/ save my edges/ see volume (once all the hair I shed builds up and the puff up a bit). I trust you'd look gorgeous no matter what you choose so you do you! (I know it's not helpful if you strictly wanted an either or answer)"
objectofdesirex,n3hf7q,"Your fro is so incredible! But hey, nothing wrong with protective styles like locs! I saw try it for a few months! Then, your fro will look even longer 😍"
personwriter,n3hf7q,"Good suggestion.&&&DON'T DO IT!

It's beautiful either way, but the fro is gorge! If you have any problems because of professional employment or something of that nature, quit and find a new job! ha Kidding. Gorgeous hair. Love seeing natural hair that ISN'T all about ""curls."""
solarpanel_d,n3hf7q,If you can commit to locs and the transition process and you really want them then I say go for it but I would recommend getting faux locs first to get an idea of how it would look. Me personally I can’t commit to one style. Your fro is absolutely gorgeous btw♥️
spo0okyspice,n3hf7q,You are already hair goals and I love it as is. Perfection.
thenewAIM,n3hf7q,"Well, what makes you curious about locs? I will say that your fro is beautiful but am confident you would look great with any style including locs."

ENTPee,n3fc71,"No Oil/No Butters #30daydetox black girl curls method&&&Hey, y'all.  Like many on this subreddit, I have struggled with my hair for as long as I can remember. I have been following hair specialists on Twitter since December and it's the best decision I've made!! I have been following the hair detox ever since I got a cut in February and it's been working great for me!! I would like to think that I know how to use my products (cleanse the scalp thoroughly every week, condition well (preferably with conditioners that have BMTS in the top 5 ingredients and no oils in the top 5 ingredients), marry the water with the conditioner, then set it with a botanical gel. I also do all of this in the shower with dripping wet hair and scrunch my hair upside down (it's short).  I don't post often on here but I wanted to ask if any of you had the ""wash your damn hair"" e-book. I cannot find the book anywhere and would like to pay full price for a digital copy to anyone who happens to have it. I'm a very slow reader and English is not my first language, so registering for the ""#SeeSomeCurls"" online course that is offered is going to prove to be very expensive for me as it takes me a lot of time to digest things. Am I missing out by not reading it? What I would like to know more about is surface texture, product formulation, and how things would change if I color my hair. The product formulation is really important as I am moving next year to a country that doesn't have quality curly products or any of the advertised products by these hair specialists. So I would want to learn how to scout for quality products that I cannot research online for reviews.

If anyone read it and is willing to share it with me please respond or DM me :) I can venmo/paypal/zelle you. For those that have it but are not willing to share it, could you at least tell me what I am missing out on?

IIIThreat,n3fc71,"Hello! I have followed the ladies since the end of last year; I actually read their book first before joining their See Some Curls academy at the beginning of the year. They actually took the book down to edit it; they said it should be up again at some point in time. 

In the meantime, I’d suggest joining their [digital academy ](https://30dayhairdetox.teachable.com/p/see-some-curls). You’ll find a TON of videos there (basically the book in video form), as well as product lists."
Jesuslovesyourbr0,n3fc71,What is BTMS?
LaFleurGrey,n3fc71,"See some curls is in video form. Its technique heavy and the only readable list I'm aware of is the cut it kinky alumni (stylist directory). Its got the science and the technique. Also if you need additional info they have this monthly questions thing where they answer via video, there are also live videos sessions for the same purpose. All eventually saved in the library for reference later. Ive watched a few more than once. But for your hair specifically you could probably just schedule a virtual appointment with one of the stylists in the directory for help with product selection. Good luck!"

AlexandraLiberty,n33kct,"Step.1 you need to accept your natural hair as it is. This seems like such a simple and basic thing to say but I promise you, Once you accept the way your hair naturally grows out of your head 90 percent of the fight will be over. 

Step. 2 leave the oils and extra butters alone. I know we’ve been conditioned to believe these things help but they don’t. And PLEASE don’t put any oil on your scalp. It blocks hair growth and causes way more problems then it solves. 

Step. 3 SHAMPOO IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. Especially if your scalp is flaking. Most black girls don’t suffer from dandruff like most of us believe. We suffer from not washing our hair enough because we think it will dry our hair out. You should be washing your hair once a week. Every five days is what works best for me. But seven can work too. I shampoo twice. Both times focusing more on my scalp and then I move on to focusing on my hair. for you since you have been using oils you need a clarifying shampoo so you can really clean your hair so your conditioner can actually do it’s job. 

Also follow this goddess on Twitter her name is camillejanae She will truly educate you on black hair. I found a stylist that was similar to her years ago that gave me all the tips she gives and it changed everything for me. As black women we have been miss educated on our hair so much just so company’s can rob us our money and self-esteem. Please give her Twitter a look. Best of luck babes. 💕💛"
Crystalbabie,n33kct,"You should shampoo your hair with a sulfate free shampoo they usually tell you on the label. Try deep conditioning your hair once a week and leave a shower cap over it for 30 min then rinse it out. After use a leave in conditioner try to get every section of hair usually people split their hair into 4 to make it easier. After the leave in use a curl cream in the same way and then use a light gel on top of everything. Search “simple natural hair routine on YouTube” 
Also some youtubers you can watch are green beauty,naptural85, onlyonejess,biancareneetoday,"
OctobersCold,n33kct,"Ah, dude I’m literally in the same boat. Welcome to the “spiteful, high-maintenance hair” club haha. Uh, unfortunately, if your hair is brittle and dry (I describe it as “crunchy”) you may have to keep the leave-in condition in until your next wash day. You can gently scratch it, but your hair may be a moisture slut and requires daily application of a ridiculous amount of hair product. In terms of what you can do about it? I’d recommend getting a mist bottle and spraying your hair down, then put your leave-in conditioner in and then rub in hair oil to seal it. Afterwards, put a plastic cap on and then your bonnet on and sleep in it. It’s gonna feel weird, for sure. Then wake up, massage the product back into your hair, put a little bit more in and go about your day. It *should* feel heavy, which takes getting used to. It shouldn’t feel dry.

Mind you, this is my routine since my hair is super crunchy and splits with a slight breeze. The products I use are from a company called The Doux. I use their mousse def, co-wash, and wash + go. Most importantly it’s gonna take a pretty long time for your hair to get used to the new routine, and you may have to try new products if you notice bad things with your hair. It’s a tedious and arduous process to maintain the hair :/"
ThenCame,n33kct,Well said this! OP I encourage you to try this out.
choosychatter,n33kct,"I’ve been there OP. I finally learned how to braid my hair during quarantine! It sounds like your scalp is dry or has too much product. Either way you should “scratch” your scalp with a fine tooth comb. It will help remove larger flakes of dandruff. Follow up with a moisturizing shampoo and/or an anti-dandruff shampoo. As for the wigs, yes you can wear wigs without braiding. Spray water on your hair and comb in back. Depending on the length you can just lay it back or put it into two low pigtails. Then put a wig cap on, then the wig. That method gets my short 4c hair down enough for a lace front. Make sure to take the wig off every night and don’t wear wigs continuously for too long! I am not good at hair and it has been a long journey for me, but I hope this helps you."
joiejojojo,n33kct,"You can wash your hair when your scalp gets itchy. You also don't need leave in conditioner. Shampoo, conditioner and gel/mousse/foam (depending on style)"
leejongliza,n33kct,"I’m 20 and I don’t know how to take care of my natural hair AT ALL&&&Sorry, I just want to get it out. I feel so lost. I’m blasian and I live in a Southeast Asian country. I have really a really thick, low porosity fro. My mom didn’t know anything about natural hair and my dad was bald (probably because having hair was too much of a hassle), so I grew up clueless and ended up straightening my hair (which turned out TERRIBLE, because the products I used were all for curly 3A hair that wanted to be a type 1). 

It’s so hard to look for natural hair products and salons, as people with my type of hair is VERY rare where I live. I just turned 20, and I don’t even know how to do a simple twist out. I’ve always tried by watching youtube tutorials, but I’ve never gotten the hang of it. I don’t know how to braid my hair. I don’t know what routine is good for my hair and if I need to have a hair care ritual every night. I just spritz it with a water, lavender oil, and argan oil mixture and slap on a satin bonnet and call it a day.

A few months ago, I just felt like I hated my hair so much for all the confusion and grief it caused and I started chopping it off. Luckily, I found an African Salon about an hour away and I got box braids after I cut it. I kept the braids in for 6 weeks, took it off, waited for 2 weeks, and put it in braids again. It’s been 5 weeks and I just took it off a few days ago. Now I have around 4 inches of hair. 

I felt really confident having box braids. I got a lot of compliments and people thought it was really cool. I looked really pretty and even got a modeling gig. It was also very low maintenance - out of sight out of mind. But now I’m faced with reality that I am stuck with hair I don’t even know how to take care of. I feel so ugly and stuck. 

I’ve been trying to figure out how to do cornrows so I could start learning how to wear a wig. But I couldn’t even do that. I tried to figure out how to do twist outs. I STILL couldn’t figure it out. I’ve been trying to figure it out for such a long time, but I feel it’s futile.

My hair feels so brittle, dry and coarse. I always try to take care of it, but it’s like nothing works. I’m so jealous of the 99% of people with straight hair here. They don’t know how difficult it is for me to just look presentable. I wish I had someone that could teach me how to take care of my own hair. Maybe then I’d hate it a little less :( 

P.S. is there a way for me to wear a wig without having to braid my hair? Also, is having flakes fall put of your hair normal? I just showered using an anti dandruff shampoo last night and so many flakes fell out when I tried to detangle my hair using my fingers...&&&thanks so much, i’m so grateful. i’ll check out her twitter rn ❤️&&&also, how do you keep your hair “clean”? Every time I use a leave in conditioner, my hair just feels so heavy and it gets itchy after a few days."
BigBeek,n336za,"no oils no butters?!?&&&Okay so I'm sure by now everyone's seen people going on about not using oils and stuff but I'm confused. I understand the concept but I have no idea how I can implement it

Currently my usual routine is shampooing and conditioning (less often than I know I should) with the Shea Moisture castor oil shampoo and conditioner, then I'll use the castor oil leave in conditioner, the As I Am pomegranate & passionfruit curl enhancing smoothie, and sometimes the Cantu curl activator cream. In-between washes I dampen my hair and use the leave in and smoothie. I tend to let my hair air dry or leave it in braids rather than use a diffuser.

From my understanding I should be washing my hair every week and just using a mousse or gel to style, but what would I do in-between? When I tried the whole wash n mousse thing it left my hair feeling pretty dry and undefined, maybe it was the mousse I used. I just ended up putting my usual products in a day later...

Do you use this method? What's your routine? Any tips would help a lot!! 💕&&&Thank youuu! 
Do you do that every time you want to restyle your hair or something or do you use a leave in?&&&Thanksss!!&&&Ty!"
CurlyWhirly125,n336za,"I use the method! So it’s super important to use A LOT of water when applying EITHER the mousse or gel. Mousse is for a style (twist out, braid out, etc) gel is for a wash and go. Additionally there is a “detox period” of about 30 days because it takes awhile to remove all oils and creams from the hair. Stick with it and you will see amazing results."
EGrass,n336za,"This is very good to know. I just did a leave in and a new gel yesterday and while defined, my hair also feels quite dry. I’ll reassess again in a month."
Suspicious_Depth_623,n336za,"You might want to check out iamblackgirlcurls on instagram and youtube! They have a ton of lives saved between both pages that could help. As for routine it’s really just cleanse, condition, style weekly — or more often if needed (ie you workout often). I use AG naturals shampoo & conditioner. I also use kinky curly come clean as a clarifying shampoo when needed. For styling because I do twist-outs I use the doux mousse def! Air drying is not necessarily the best way to dry your hair. Also there should be no need to wet your hair between washes if you cleansed and conditioned properly. Hth !"

IalbaSsort,n2swx2,"i put a split end into a cup of water, and it floated. but when i touched it, it SLOWLY sank.&&&My hair takes a bit to get wet, like a minute, and deep conditioner kinda dries on my ends until i wash it out. (only one in my family that has afro hair, that didn't perm and destroy it so I have no clue if thats normal) However, I've never had an oily scalp nor have i had significant product buildup ever.

My hair texture is 4-A to 3-C. Friends say 4-A, I say 3-C.

Thank you!"
ohemaa18,n2swx2,"The float test is not an accurate measure of porosity. It gives different results on different days, with different water sources, and how clean your hair is. Additionally, hair porosity is [not a constant](https://twitter.com/jenniferrosenyc/status/1330313339206053894?s=21): it can change based on weather/climate, time of year, and other factors.
