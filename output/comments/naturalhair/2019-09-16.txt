511lonette,d7zsjr,SS/  The ife360 channel has  video about her hair journey.  She has beautiful 4c hair and she uses a lot of natural ayurvedic powders.
JustLurkingHereMan,d7zsjr,"You can look on YouTube and search for ""natural hair journey"" videos and subscribe to the channels you like. I don't know of any channel *dedicated* to showing progress, but you can find a lot of YouTubers by searching.

Edited to include: plenty of natural hair journey videos show their progress of recovering from relaxers, heat damage, neglect, etc. Most don't go back to straightening their hair."
katieb2793,d7zsjr,"Video recommendations for Before and After&&&[removed]&&&If I could upvote this like 100 times I would. Thank you so much! I love it!&&&Thank you! I also just discovered loc ACV rinses, and OH MY GOSH, they're amazing!&&&Thank you!"
nicestshawtyalive,d7zsjr,"sksksks i'm glad you asked this question. if you look through my post history you can see I have plenty of posts on BeautyGuruChatter about black hair care. In fact, I'm going to post more right now!

I'd recommend channels like Hazel Goddess, Bubs Bee, Nappyfu, Naptural85, and Natural Reign. you might enjoy wash day videos specifically. if you like watching twist out or braid out videos, check out more type 4b/4c youtubers. if you like wash and gos and curl defining, you might want to try type 3b/3c/4a youtubers."
CoffeeB4Talkie,d7wks1,"Could be either or both.... My ends do that when they're split or super dry.

I do notice that I have to baby my ends more so than the rest of my hair or it will look more poofy... even if the ends aren't split. Which makes sense since the ends are the oldest... so I always moisturize the ends first, then work my way up. 

After my leave in, I usually add oil. I notice a difference when I do that. 

Are the scissors you using dull?"
jwash1894,d7wks1,"The only thing that I know of that's associated with what you described is split ends.

I'd advise going to a professional salon and ask for a blow out and a proper trim. Sometimes, people try to cut their own off and don't do it correctly."
quality-bun,d7wks1,"hair thicker at the ends?&&&so while washing my hair after having box braids for a while i noticed my hair was noticeably thicker at the ends than the roots or middle, It was also very very dry at the ends, no matter how much i conditioned and oiled it, it stayed really dry. i put it in braids for a braid out later and the ends ended up so puffy. I have no idea if this means i have split ends (i trimmed right before my box braids) or it is somehow damaged? has anyone else had this problem?&&&they may be, they are very old scissors, they could possibly predate me. It may be dryness since i was a bit neglectful of my hair moisturize. It still detangles just as easily just feels really rough&&&Ah okay thank you!"
bemusingmusings,d7ru3c,"Uneven cut, 4c curls&&&I had some pretty epic split ends after months and months of terrible self-care... so when I finally got around to cutting my hair I went a bit overboard. 

A lot overboard... I have twists that are up to 2 inches shorter than their neighbors. It‚Äôs ridiculous. 

I‚Äôm going to be taking this opportunity to spend a month on a strict hair care regimen. 

Adequate water, vitamins, oils, antifungal treatments and finger-detangling these 100 or so twists... maybe I‚Äôll be able keep the uneven pieces separate until I reach a length where I can have it cut evenly and wear it in the light of day. Idk. üò¢"

Tokenesque,d7fnwt,I didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing. Congratulations.
mochaunicorn,d7fnwt,"Two strand twist wash success!!&&&Just washed my hair in two strand twists for the first time!! I've been so scared to do it, lol. My goal is to start locs on my own, so I just went for it!

I misted my hair with a mix of water and tea tree oil. In the shower I rinsed my hair and and let the water run down the twists. I used aussie moist on my scalp, rubbed the shampoo in my scalp, and squeezed down my twists. Repeated 3 times and rinsed thoroughly. I clipped my twists up as I finished my shower. Rinsed hair with cold water and I was done!

Once out, I misted my scalp with my water oil mix and put on a shower cap. Left that on for 10 min. Then put on a 100% cotton t-shirt on my head/hair to help dry twists. Last, just letting it air dry.

No twists unraveled. It's a little fuzzy on top, but that doesn't bother me. My twists feel so light!! Next wash I plan to retwist the roots and hop on this loc journey!

I have about 100 twists and I do them myself. Just wanted to share with someoneüòä Thanks for reading!!&&&Lol. Thanks! I've read stories that people's twists tangled or unraveled. That kept me from doing it in the past. My twists are soft, light, and cleanüòä&&&My hair probably is probably past shoulder length. I've been wearing twists for two years. This set was in for three weeks. It takes me 7-9 hours to do them each time."
npbm2008,d7fnwt,"How long is your hair, and how long have the twists been in? A hundred twists? Whew!"
1SweetT,d755qp,"I used to have a problem with dryness. I could put a product in my hair in the morning and by the afternoon my hair would be brittle dry. I also had a huge problem with fuzziness. I started using Hawaiian Silky. Every since I've been using Hawaiian Silky, my hair has been holding in moisture. It's sooooo soft and manageable. I love the way Hawaiian Silky makes my hair feel and looks. My hair has grown since I've started using Hawaiian Silky too. I've been natural for 8 1/2 yrs now. I have tried so many different products on my hair to keep it moisturized. Nothing has worked liked Hawaiian Silky.  Maybe you can give it a try. I hope it helps you like it helped me. I wish you the best! :)"
CoffeeB4Talkie,d755qp,"I read that their JBCO line contains the highest amount of protein. So just be aware of that.&&&When I deep condition, I always make sure to get my edges. Then I make sure I put JBCO on before I put my cap and let it sit. 

I use the Sunny Isle brand (extra dark). The Jamaican Mango & Lime brand seems watered down to me."
FattyMayonaise,d755qp,"Hair is extra dry & frizzy in the front/around the edges? Nothing seems to help.&&&Hey everyone, so my hair pattern is 3C (transitioning after texturizer was put in my hair last December, long story smh), but the front of my hair (the hair mostly around my edges) looks extra dry, dull, broken and frizzy (and always has prior to the texturizer). I put extra conditioner in that area whenever i'm deep conditioning, put extra moisturizing products there (currently using cantu curl activator for moisture, as well as design essentials curl defining creme), and that area ends up looking exactly the same once its dried (albeit a tad bit softer). The frizziness is extra noticeable whenever I tie my hair back into a bun/ponytail (i've NEVER been able to have perfectly slicked back hair because all the little frizzies pop back up less than 15 mins after styling).

The person who gave me my first curly cut last month said the hair looks like its been exposed to too much protein hence why it looks like that, which is why I've been focusing on products containing ""moisturizing"" on the bottle. I don't know much about what products contain protein however. (I'm pretty much a noob in the natural hair world lol).

&#x200B;

Anyone else have/had this problem and what products/methods have you used to solve it? Thanks in advance!&&&I honestly can‚Äôt tell if my hair is just ‚Äúdrier/frizzier‚Äù in the front from lacking something, or if my hair texture is just simply different there. I actually just noticed the hair on one side of my edges is in a slightly better state than the other side and I can twirl the hair and form some tiny curls. The other side however is just a lot ‚Äúharder‚Äù to the touch which makes me lean towards it being a little of both. 

And thanks! Tomorrow‚Äôs wash day and I‚Äôll try out the curl enhancing creme and hopefully good things happen lol. (I realized actually I had this product in my house the whole time within my sister‚Äôs hair product stash ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)&&&I think I lot of it actually broke off due to the texturizer. It was longer before but the first 1-2 inches of that piece of hair have Always been frizzy/dry without me knowing what products to use. 

What heavy gels or mouses would you recommend? Lord knows I need my edges tamed and not curling back up after 5 seconds üò≠"
bemusingmusings,d755qp,"Could it be that the hair at the front of your head is a different hair type than the majority of your hair? 

You may need different products for that area, products that are too heavy for the rest of your head. Try Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie as well as the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave-In Conditioner as well. Yes try both, no not at the same time. At least not to start."
paceandunderstanding,d755qp,"It may be that those hairs genetics aren‚Äôt programmed to grow long and/or thick enough to make it back in to your ponytail.  Having short fine edges is common. That is where a lot of people either use heavy gel to blend them back, or slick them downward ala ‚Äúbaby hair‚Äù. 

Personally, I like to use mouse that encourages them to curl up in tiny little defined spirals, it is counter intuitive to making them conform, but it is the prettiest to me."
renesha03,d755qp,"Hey could it be that your face cleanser/toner/treatment is getting on your edges? Also, you can try tying your edges with a silk/satin scarf at night and also using the scarf method to slick edges. Lastly Castor oil on damp edges is nice as well."
hairmistress,d6u1bl,FINGER COILS / STYLES FOR SHORT NATURAL HAIR&&&
Sea_Soil,d6mjh1,"I have 3c/4a hair (my curl pattern actually looks EXACTLY like hers!) and I put my hair in two strand twists at night, otherwise, its tangle heaven.

My hair is shoulder length so I'm able to do 4-6 larger twists. Her hair is relatively short so just section the hair and do a lot of smaller twists. I use the LOC/LCO method and my twists last up to a week before getting fuzzy and dry. My current routine is: 

1. wash day: wash, detangle, deep condition. 
2. after rinsing and getting out of the shower, LOC method for moisture. Leave-in, oil, cream on damp towel-dried hair.
3. twists, 4-6 sections
4. Wear twists for 4 to 7 days, moisturizing with a spray bottle of water/conditioner if needed.
5. remove twists, wear the resulting twist out for 2-3 days. 
6. repeat.

Cornrows are also a great option if you are able to do them. Unfortunately, I'm not blessed with that skill so I have to get someone else to do them for me lol. Good luck!"
everydayemelie,d6mjh1,"Tangle questions about daughter‚Äôs 3c/4a hair/bedtime routine!&&&&&&Nora just turned 3, and we‚Äôve nailed our routine... almost. Currently detangling every. single. night. It‚Äôs easy to do, I‚Äôve nailed the method, but it takes ~15 mins between finger detangling and then using her ‚Äúbrush.‚Äù

She sleeps in a satin cap, but there are crazy tangles EVERY DAY. I think more protective styles at night would help. (Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) Google pulls up lots, but her hair is too short ‚Äî especially in the back. We can barely get away with Bantu knots back there.&&&How do I make twists or a twist out last more than 1 day? She‚Äôs 3, and WILD. Haha. Her fair is a hot mess within the same day of a new hairstyle.&&&They‚Äôre usually in Bantu knots or down. I‚Äôm going to try twists tomorrow night! Thank you so much for your suggestion"
fivefivew_browneyes,d6mjh1,I agree with others that two strand twists would be easy. Then after a few days you can undo them and get another hair style for a few more days.
nathnychild,d6mjh1,Is her hair in loose twists or braids  when she wears the satin cap at night?  It might help with less tangles in the morning. She looks like her hair is long enough to rock two strands twists or even two cornrows.
1SweetT,d6l7fi,CONGRATULATIONS on going natural!!! I've been natural for 8 1/2 years.  You have beautiful hair. It seems like so far your doing an excellent job. Keep up the good work and enjoy and have fun with you beautiful natural hair ;)
bdazed,d6l7fi,Attempting natural wore wigs for years any tips would be appreciated&&&&&&Thank you so much I‚Äôm still trying to figure out my type of curl wise and what‚Äôs the best to use but it‚Äôs so fun to see what my hair does
sqwzmahmeatybts,d6l7fi,Doing great! Been natural for 10 years and haven't had a style come out this good yet. Congrats on starting your healthy hair journey!
ccangel16,d6hyyz,"Curls still Poppin too üòçüòçüòç
I thought about cutting my hair just for a shorter regimen"
hbnorris0380,d6hyyz,"Loving the curls that I am getting from this short natural regimen that I am new too!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞&&&&&&In this situation it took me a couple of months to get over it because my hair fail out bad due to a stressful situation I was in!! So I had no choice, but to cut it, but now since I had gotten it cut I am feeling the curls like everyone else!! Thank you"
