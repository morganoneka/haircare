AnalTattoo,hdjc8u,Beautiful!
athenakathleen,hdjc8u,So cute!!!
gigi116,hdjc8u,Nice. How had you stretched your hair before doing the bantu knots?
imeansurefineokay,hdjc8u,"Same-day Bantu knot-out on stretched natural hair. I didn‚Äôt have the patience to wait overnight but am digging the fluffy look. Low density, low porosity hair and swearing by weekly deep conditioning + hair steamer. Just started that this April, but have been natural 6+ years.&&&&&&Gentle blow dry with low heat. I get hair cuts ~11 weeks and which is the only time it‚Äôs gets blow dried. In between hair cuts if I go for a similar look, I section into 5 parts and do large 2 strand twists for it to air dry over night and then Bantu knot. Gets way more texture that way!"
rceg,hdjc8u,"Looks really good! I don't blame you for not wanting to wait overnight, bantu knots are so uncomfortable to sleep in."
speechnerdlife,hdjc8u,Absolutely love how it came out. Gives me 70s vibes

KekeAse,hdi4o7,"What‚Äôs your night routine? Type 4 hair please!&&&Hello! I‚Äôve made the decision to start wearing my hair out and I always wear a bonnet to sleep, but when I wake up my hair is always so tangled (and somehow shrank??) I have 4c, low porosity hair! 

I‚Äôve tried parting it into four and putting it into twists but I feel like it didn‚Äôt help and made it even more tangled (I probably didn‚Äôt do it right honestly) 

I‚Äôd love to know what everyone else‚Äôs nightly hair routine is! Maybe I can take some tips from it! Thanks (:&&&honestly I haven‚Äôt considered that! Thank you I‚Äôll try it! (:&&&Thats a good idea! What moisturizer do you use?&&&Wow it does sound like a lot but I‚Äôm always willing to try new things! Does the water make your hair shrink?"
MCLenaLoud,hdi4o7,"I use satin scrunchies at night with a bonnet on top. I  gently section my hair with my fingers, put the scrunchie on (I don't loop the scrunchie. Just put it on the section of hair like you would a stretchy bracelet on your arm), and a large bonnet. In the morning, I take them all off, finger fluff, and moisturize as needed."
justht,hdi4o7,"The tighter the pattern, the greater the shrinkage and unfortunately, the more likely it is to tangle too. (Good hydration and damage avoidance/trimming damage away can minimize this within reason, but I'm sure you already know that.)

I have a bunch of cheap satin scarves that I got on Amazon. I tie one over my hair every night and also when I want to pull something like a turtleneck over my head, I use a scarf to protect my ends. Depending on your length, you may need to tie up your hair into a ""pineapple"" to keep the ends from getting smooshed and rubbing with each other."
oyibimccord,hdi4o7,"Instead of putting it in twists, try putting it in braids?"
thatsmypearl,hdi4o7,I also have 4c lowpo hair! Anytime I wear my hair out I spritz with warm/kindaaa hot water and seal with jojoba oil. I then twist my hair in 8-10 medium sized twists. It does take a bit longer but I‚Äôve noticed my hair stays untangled if I detangle and twist in smaller sections. I sometimes do braids but twists are a bit gentler on my hair. I also wear a bonnet and use a silk pillow case because idk how people sleep without their bonnet falling off loll.

AnalTattoo,hde7wx,Your hair is magnificent!
Sonicrules14,hde7wx,"My hair 2 weeks after a wash n go&&&&&&Lol it was dirty. If you can see the white specks (even more around the bangs), that‚Äôs my hair gel flaking lol&&&Besides a silk pillow case and a silk scarf, I try to only touch my hair twice a day. When I‚Äôm taking my scarf off in the morning/ styling it and when I‚Äôm putting the scarf on in before bed. 

Also, putting a little oil on your hands before manipulating your hair could help reduce frizz and messing up the curls imo&&&I pineapple my hair using a silk scarf and also use a silk pillowcase, just in case it comes off in the middle of the night.&&&You might have to switch up the routine!&&&After washing and conditioning my hair, I use Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner and shingle my hair with Olive Oil Ecostyler gel. After that, I let my hair air dry. :) But I‚Äôll use a dryer on low heat if I‚Äôm in a rush or during the winter.

And I make sure to use a silk scarf to pineapple my hair at night and a silk pillowcase. :)&&&Thank you :)&&&All I really do is take off my silk scarf and shake my hair out. I‚Äôll put oil on my hands (especially the finger tips) before I part my hair in different styles or manipulate it. The oil helps me from messing up the curl pattern and making it frizzy. 

If I pull it back, sometimes I‚Äôll spray a little water on my edges and reslick them.&&&After washing and conditioning my hair, I use Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner and shingle my hair with Olive Oil Ecostyler gel.

CoffeeB4Talkie,hdcoii,I like The Mane Choice. They have tons of options.
atctia,hdcoii,"TGIN triple moisture conditioner is great. And I love Mielle's pomegranate and Honey, as well as their Rosemary and mint deep conditioner"
justht,hdcoii,"What kinds of styles do you go for? What ingredients have worked well for you in the past? Does your hair like occasional protein? Does it hate anything with protein?

If  Shea moisture low porosity conditioner worked really well for you, it can be good to check the ingredient list from the discontinued conditioner and look for something with a similar line up."
matchaicecreamx,hdcoii,"conditioners for low porosity&&&i have the Shea moisture low porosity conditioner but I think they discontinued it, any conditioners/shampoos that work well on low porosity hair?"

pinkypaz123,hd5kk1,"First twist-out&&&[https://imgur.com/a/kHxPApe](https://imgur.com/a/kHxPApe)

So last night I decided to do my first ever twist out and whilst I think that I did an alright job (please excuse the fluffy crown at the front!), I don't think it suits me? The general shape is a bit weird to me. I know it is due for a trim and cut to make it more even so that could be part of the problem. Please know that this is the best picture I took and that involved a lot of manipulation

It's really annoying since I really want to explore my hair because I really haven't gotten the chance to and I just want something a little different than just doing blowouts all the time."
starisha,hd5kk1,You should try products that are specifically for twists like the camille rose almond jai twisting butter or for a cheaper option the cream of nature honey twisting creme.  Also try doing smaller parts.
SunflowerinVirgo0903,hd0l25,Dont straighten it ever. Keep growing and taking care of it. You look beautiful

jessdaye212,hctezb,"Braiding advice for super fine hair&&&Hey yall! I want to try faux locs on my hair. From the tutorials I've seen, you do individual braids then add hair through the root of your braid with a crochet tool. My problem is my braids slide away from the root. I don't know how to stop it 

There's also the rubberband method, but the rubber bands slide too! I paid someone to do passion twists once and they slid out same day. The woman used the rubberband method and doubled up on the rubberbands.

Any advice for getting braids to stay tight at the root?"
