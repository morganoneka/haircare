Iris_Sanchez,pe93q8,"This is the longest my hair has been in over a decade.

I wash my hair in braids. I only take down the braids once a month. I use only Blue Magic Products and grape seed oil (lotion first, then oil then grease). I use herbal essences rose combo.I rarely comb my hair mainly finger detangle. 

Personally I shouldn’t be giving my two cents because we don’t have the same struggle…but what it mainly comes down to is keeping your hair moisturized with little manipulation."
alsajo,pe93q8,"Help with Hair Length Retention&&&I have been natural since 2016 but it wasn’t until 2018-2019 I started learning how to really care for my hair which included heat protection etc and if I can help it no heat at all especially since 2020. 
I find myself ever month cutting the thinner layers of my hair. I am not sure what I am doing wrong with my hair but I wash it weekly, sometimes more often depending on how my scalp feels (dermatitis). I moisturize, use oil, and air dry. I keep my hair braided and untouched for as long as I am able, my dermatitis makes it difficult and scalp irritated after prolonged periods of time. 
My hair seems to stay the same length even when stretching it out, I would like tips on how to retain the length of my hair and keep it healthy while also combatting seborrheic dermatitis (which I need to wash frequently for and I use a foam)."
FantasticHamburguesa,pe6sxp,Yea I absolutely love grease. It’s cheap and works better than any sealant I’ve ever tried. I like Africa’s Best.
HoeForCookieDough,pe6sxp,"Same, it’s the only thing that keeps my hair moisturized for longer than just a couple days"
ILive4Banans,pe6sxp,"Sulfates are fine if you know how to use them, they're stripping so it makes sense to use a shampoo with it when you're trying to cleanse you're hair - you just need to follow it with a moisturising shampoo after"
M_Sia,pe6sxp,"I never even knew people would avoid Sulfates as I would wash with Suave Shampoo and Conditioner Suave and it would be fine. 

When these grease threads come up it’s as if this magical item all along and it made everyone’s hair long and healthy like nah I think people’s hair is better now with more products for natural hair but the problem is many over complicate it. My mother, brother, and father all have short hair and they use grease regularly and it works for them. I have the longest hair, wear “protective” (honestly not the type to wear my hair in an Afro or twist out unless it’s for a special event) styles, don’t use grease and my hair is growing rather quickly for cutting it 2-3 years ago after dreads.&&&When I blow dry and have braid without extensions I use hair pomade (I stan Nature’s Blessing Hair Pomade and another African hair pomade). 

I don’t see use for hair grease while in extensions since I don’t want to cause buildup and much rather use a spray. But in the winter time hair grease works well."
Miriam-Esi,pe6sxp,"I have always used sulfates. I like that hair grease keeps my hair moisturized, I just hate they way it feels in my hair. I prefer oils and butters."
PrairieJack,pe6sxp,"When you stop doing something you have to understand why you should stop doing it. Otherwise you'll be doing a lot of back and forth without any direction. A lot of the gurus just say stuff and don't really explain why. With that being said, washing with sulfate shampoo should remove the buildup from using hair grease.

I haven't used hair grease in over a decade and my hair is fine. So you can succeed with having healthy hair with or without hair grease, you just have to understand why products work or don't work and understand what ingredients are meant to do.

Sulfates are safe, they were never going to make your hair fall out."
SecretAntWorshiper,pe6sxp,"I don't think grease is bad especially since with curly hair the biggest problem is maintaining hydration. 

Sulfates are generally bad because they strip oil and dry out your hair more, which isn't good for curly hair. There is a degree though some sulfates are more harsh compared to others. The other problem is that the harsh ones linger in your hair and conplie when you re-use them, the less harsh ones don't do this.

Imo the biggest problem with thick curly hair is maintaining moisture and hydration which is why you want grease and don't want. There is truth to the concerns but the best thing is to read the ingredients and search up anything you don't know about. Almost every sulfate used in hair is easily found online and you can read articles about the compound.

Personally I don't do grease and avoid sulfates when I can and my hair has been the healthiest its ever been."
ShereeAmore,pe6sxp,One thing I have had to drill into my brain is that everyones hair is different. I can have the exact same hair as someone else and it reacts completely differently to products.
TheyCallMeTabs,pe6sxp,I swear by blue magic
Trapitha,pe6sxp,I still grease my scalp also. I have dandruff and dryness issues and it's the only thing that keeps me from digging around in my hair causing shedding. It's so much more important to use what works for you instead of following a set of rules for everyone.
VeganandlovingIt,pe6sxp,Just have to do what's best for your hair. Kudos to you for actually paying attention to what your hair needs instead of the latest hype in the natural hair community.
babydo11_,pe6sxp,"Garnier whole blends honey is the shittt! I use the conditioner and it makes my hair soo soft im in love. And honestly yeah the whole sulfates bad silicones bad stuff is definitely not true and not the case for everyone. I realized rhat without silicones my hair would break, and without sulfates every once in a while the buildup was terrible. Cant believe all the fads"
darioismario,pe6sxp,"I literally don’t put use any products in my hair other than shampoo and conditioner, I let my hair air dry into an afro (I have type 4 hair) and my hair has gotten so long, find what works for you!"
lillonb,pe6sxp,"Go by what works for your hair  during all seasons 
My hair has been dry since I moved to North America. I use a mix of olive oil and shay butter on my hair mixed with herbs and other oils. I spray my hair with aloe Vera with mixed of oil. I was my hair with clay mixed with oil or apple cider mixed with herbs. When I am back in Africa, I don’t really need use this much on my hair."
medusa3339,pe6sxp,What product do you use if you don’t mind me asking?
nomoreconversations,pe6sxp,"Don't listen to full time influencers. Especially on YouTube, they have to put out videos every week or can't get views. Putting out standard advice will not cut it so they have to go on all these challenges where they cut out completely rationale things to get attention. 

I'll be recommended so many videos of ""no butter oil or grease challenges"" and I'm just like ""ok if you want to ruin your hair go ahead lmao I'm not watching."""
snowfall80,pe6sxp,I spent so much on products following others. Came across a YouTube video of a woman using grease and I never looked back. Thought about what was used on my hair growing up and the major product was grease and maybe some hair lotion. Didn’t use a million products and making it overly complicated.
vintagepop,pe6sxp,"Why did I listen to all the people who said hair grease is bad?&&&I guess I've been sucked into the world of ""grease is bad, sulfates are bad, etc"" for a while now. I did all of that and my hair wasn't very healthy or growing much. 

But now I use a shampoo with sulfates (garnier whole blends honey shampoo) and conditioner, carols daughter honey mimosa pomade to grease my scalp, and Camille rose almond milk and honey butter and my hair has never been healthier

I mean I just put it in one big braid in the back and wear it like that for 2 weeks and wash it and it's grown so much and been so healthy!! It's super thick and long and I love it so much and it's so much less maintenance 


Tldr; grease is amazing and sulfates won't make your hair fall out&&&Yes exactly! My hair used to have so much dandruff and I tried oil because everyone said oil was the way to fix it but it never worked for me.&&&Exactly! And wholeblends honey is my favorite like I have to shampoo my scalp like 3x to get a good lather and get all of the buildup and grease and gel out and my hair does feel kind of dry but that conditioner puts it right back in it's awesome"
ChocolateNapqueen,pe6jp8,"Yes conditioner will help this issue. Not even a lot and you’ll be able to comb your hair a lot better. 

Technically, oil and water don’t mix so this wouldn’t really help your hair detangle itself. Conditioner is like a slippery agent for your hair. 

The Aussie Moisture conditioner works well for detangling and has a lot of slip. 

Good luck."
KarrarMania,pe6jp8,"Why is my hair so hard to detangle?&&& Detangling has been my biggest struggle and it's only getting worse as my hair grows. Ive to go through alot of struggle to make a ponytail do i need to trim or something? Also i dont use conditioner i use Mustard Oil/Cocnut Oil should i start using conditioner would that help?

MissD34,pe6jp8,I swear by [this](https://www.princessdgifts.com/products/aloe-rose-detangling-spray) and it has a lot of slip and makes detangling my hair a breeze.
platform__crocs,pe6jp8,"conditioner will make your hair really easy to detangle! you should also maybe try an EZ brush, my friends with hair of similar texture swear by them"
vortexofnull,pe6jp8,Do you brush from root to ends or ends to root? Ends to root is the way to go. That way you can work out tangles before they get too bad. I'm also a huge fan of It's a 10 leave in conditioner. It comes in a little spray container and you don't need to use much. It's a fantastic detangler and doesn't weigh down hair.
Baby_Kermit,pe5xfp,"Permanent Stretching On Bottom Layer??&&&     Only the bottom layer of hair below the ear is looser curls than the rest of my hair. Most of my hair is 3c and the bottom part is more like 3a. This only started happening as I began wearing it up more and trying different styles. I somehow almost always do the bottom of my hair too tight and I feel like it could be permanently stretched. I really hate having such a jump in textures, does anyone have any tips to prevent/reverse this?"
miaemo,pe5xfp,"Have you tried using a protein treatment? If not, you might want to try one since they can help restore/tighten your curls back up. I personally love using the Curlsmith Bond Curl Rehab Salve since it is both a bond builder and a protein treatment."
Beneficial-Meat-9438,pe5lss,I’m a competitive swimmer and I condition and detangle in the shower after getting out the pool. I only wash my hair once a week and this includes deep conditioning. You can put in some leave in conditioner before getting in the water.
Dorkydori,pe5lss,"How can you keep your 4c hair healthy if you go to the beach often?&&&Should you still shampoo and condition after being in the water? Because I know you’re only supposed to wash your hair once a week. Also, what are some good protective styles that are good for the beach?"
Wertyasda,pe5lss,"But how long does the process of washing and drying and additionally styling your hair take you, if you are shampooing and conditioning frequently during the week?"
atomicoddball,pe5lss,"Well id suggest som sort of swim cap, as now there are more options for people with afro,kinky & curly hair like the [Soul Cap](https://soulcap.com/shop/extra-large-swimming-cap) they also sell products on amazon if thats more convenient. On top of that you can always accessorize a swim cap with a very cute bonnet, though im not sure how well it would hold up in the water 😅"
cagedplant,pe5lss,"I slather shea butter all throughout my hair before I swim, since it creates a hydrophobic layer around hair shafts. It wouldn’t hurt to put a cap on either tho. Washing and deep conditioning after you swim will remove the salty/chlorinated water + sand and keep it moisturized. Try some braids next time! They’re really easy to wash and you can swang em."
edi_confetti,pe5lss,If you're exposing your hair to salt or chlorine I would definitely wash your hair right after. I don't think it's healthy to leave it in your hair too long. Maybe try a moisturizing hair mask might be good like others have said.
victoriaexox,pe5lss,Maybe try dong a hair mask overnight? Or some twists with a good oil and leave in conditioner overnight. That’s what I’d do for my hair or my sisters when going to the beach often as the beach water dries my hair out completely.
world2021,pe5lss,"Not sure why you think you should only wash your hair once per week? Personally, I shampoo every time I expose my hair to chlorine or salt water as I want to limit the effects they have on my hair rather than leave them there . Then I condition to counteract the shampoo i.e. moisturise, bring the pH levels back down. 

I've never used this product so am not endorsing it, but you may find it helpful: https://www.philipkingsley.co.uk/swimcap-75ml.html

ETA: Despite its name, the product is a cream, not a swimming cap. Actual swimming caps won't help you. Added: but they won't hurt either."
Maximum-Owl-2048,pdydhg,Following
Tacox706,pdydhg,I've been using Ancient Sunrise henna for years. I do feel like it's a benefit to my hair and I personally love the deep red tint I've gained over time. I rinse it out with conditioner to combat dryness right away but my hair feels great after.
Thatonepandathing,pdydhg,"It definitely strengthened my hair and made it appear more defined ( though my texture was still the same). I don't know all the biochemistry behind it, but henna coats the hair which is why you are advised to not dye your hair after. I have high porosity hair so I normally use a regular deep conditioner with protein in it, but I would use henna again. It was a good ""reset"" for me, but I think it was moreso worth it because of how my hair functioned after."
VelvetQueen1212,pdydhg,"Henna treatment? Is it good for curls?&&&I'm interested in trying henna for my curls. I've heard it does wonders but I know noone personally who has done it. Can anyone who knows about it or has used it share their experiences with me before I buy it to try at home? They do henna treatments here in my country, but it's unnecessarily expensive and I'd like to save my coins in any way I can. My hair is jet black, its a tiny bit of 3c; majority of it is type 4 hair. I did my big chop in May 2021 and I've managed to retain length trying different treatments. Just wanna give my curls the best and see which treatments it likes best.&&&Thats what I want, don't really want the colour tbh. Because I want the option option colour later on. I only want the treatment. Okay so search for henna gloss, will do. Thank you so much!&&&Ah. I see. Thank you for this 💕&&&Thank you so much for this 💕🥺&&&And where would I get the most organic types of henna? Scared to order online but if I must."
dkay822,pdydhg,"I don’t usually comment but Henna is complex so I can’t stand by and not say anything lol. Henna can be utilized as a mask, gloss, tea rinse, or oil. The mask and gloss are both considered treatments. For right now I advise you start with a henna gloss only. Use 1 tsp of Henna, 1 Avocado, 1 tbsp of Olive Oil, and just enough water to make a paste. This was the only method I used that did not tangle my hair. It was beyond smooth. I will post the link that will give you all the info you need. Henna does stretch your natural hair and will gradually lighten it. The longer you let your treatment sit the more the dye will release in the henna. I only let my treatments sit for about an hour because I do not want to change my hair color. If you are doing the henna treatment, you need to use 100% organic Henna. Do not use colored henna. I strongly recommend Curly Proverbs Henna. I also add MSM to all my treatments and DIY oils. Follow the Henna Gloss Method 1 in the link I post and you will be fine. I also recommend making your own henna oil. That is also included in the link. There are so many benefits to henna and other Ayurvedic herbs. You just have to find what works for you.

hangnaildevil,pdydhg,Do you make henna gloss or do you buy it from somewhere?
happyhippoking,pdydhg,"I used the Henna product from Lush. I wanted to color by jet-black hair. It made my hair rusett/coppery that was visible in the light. It smoothed my hair’s cuticle and made my hair look a bit shinier; whereas my hair has more of a sheen. It strengthened my strands a bit, resulting in less shedding.

My stylist did tell me that I couldn't dye over henna because Henna is permanent (some stylists say you can though), so that's a drawback. I would do Henna Gloss since it gives the benefits without the color."
joiejojojo,pdydhg,It can damage your hair in the long run. I wouldn't recommend
stealthpursesnatch,pdydhg,I just hennaed my hair this afternoon. I’ve been using it for 10-11 years to cover grey. Personally I wouldn’t use it if I didn’t want the color because you can’t color over it. You’re always at the risk of it leaving a red cast on your hair even with a gloss. And it doesn’t wash out.
ESQ2020,pdvm6p,Taper with a nice little undercut is always fly. A whole vibe!
basichoneybadger,pdvm6p,"Fade, or Taper with Twist/Twisted Hair&&&Hi, I'm not really sure if I'm supposed to drop questions here or if anyone can really answer, but I am trying to decide whether to get a fade or a taper with my next haircut since the sides of my head have gotten pretty long with a normal twist/two strand twist.

I was wonder if any of you guys could recommend if either a taper or fade to be the best form of action to look nice.   
Or should i not even cut any hair off of the sides and maybe just leave it.  
Im also not sure a barber would be willing to undo and cut off some of my side hair growth for a cut.   


thanks"

lolofreeb,pdnq80,"Sorry babes. Can’t change your texture. But you can grow it out and try new styles like twist and braids outs. Wash and gos can work on 4c hair, but you shouldn’t expect to see what you would from a person with 3c hair. 

I would suggest finding photos and videos of people with your hair texture and do the styles that look good on them to start off"
spynxzo,pdnq80,"About 4c hair for a boy&&&Hi im a 14 year old boy thats been struggling with my hair since i was just about 9.Ive always wanted ""curly hair"" but ive never been able to get it.everytime i attempt a wash and go it never works.It makes me so mad that i was cursed with this hair.It doesnt look good.I just hate it.I see so many people with nice curly hair and thens theres me.Please help if theres any way i can get curls of any form.I would appreciate it"
ESQ2020,pdn2uf,"Are you opposed to Eco Styler? Any reason why you said ""other than?"" Also would recommend Aunt Jackie's flaxseed gel."
Smooth-Barnacle-489,pdn2uf,Creme of nature  maximum hold styling gel. You can also try mousse
Stormcaster06,pdn2uf,Kinky Curly. Great hold. Doesn’t dry out the hair and it doesn’t take a harsh shampoo to wash it out.

louisesydney,pdn2uf,"Big Poppa gel by Le Doux! It gives so much definition for my v dense and coily hair.

ozmofasho,pdn2uf,Eco styler red or black lid.
rk724,pdn2uf,Those who rock wash n gos...what (singular) gel do you use?&&&I use Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic by itself.

I'll give it a try!&&&Yes I was worried about ingredients and build up and I didn't like how crispy my hair was when I used it. Its good to know it washes out okay. Maybe I'll revisit it~
rossablue,pdn2uf,I use Uncle Funky’s Daughter as a base and follow it with Innersense’s I Create Hold. Uncle Funky’s doesn’t work for me on its own.
the_onri,pdn2uf,"II used to use The Mane Choice Cheers Gel-ato for my twist outs (no leave-in or cream), and the hold was very firm. But I actually waited until it ran out before switching over to wash-and-go’s (for which I use Unkle Funky + Eco Styler Krystal), so I can’t say whether it performs the same for that style.

Is there a particular reason that you want to avoid Wetline and Eco Styler though? If it’s a matter of ingredients, I feel you, but they’re supposedly fine so long as you wash your hair properly and often, i.e., at least once a week."

You do too right?&&&Thank you 💕 so I've been experimenting with rice water and sea moss. I also recently made a hair tea with Chinese Green Tea bags and rosemary leaves. Used this as a leave in. It's lovely but has a dark tint so best for dark hair. For the sea moss, I started using it health wise and saw where it can be used in your hair too. It gives top notch definition when you use the water the sea moss was soaked in and also the gel. I want to make the sea moss gel into an actual hair gel soon. Rice water I've been doing for years now. I just set it overnight and add avocado or peppermint oil to it. Works great for thickness and length for some. Up next to try is Henna powder.

InTooDee,pdlhia,Maybe take him to a barber that has experience with that type of hair to give him confidence that his hair can look good. From there you can figure out how to maintain that hairstyle or make frequent barber visits

It can get knotted pretty bad sometimes and I feel like when I do go through it I’m ripping a ton of my hair out. I try to sleep with a high/loose ponytail every night but by the next morning it doesn’t really look cute anymore. Does anyone have some tips on just daily maintenance to prevent knots and to keep my hair looking nice? Thank you so much
socialla,pdgs2e,"How often do you detangle your hair, and how? Your hair sheds 50-100 strands a day, so if you wait a long time in between your detangle session, there will be a lot more hair. I detangle once a week; on average, that's 350-700 strands of hair that are naturally falling out and tangling with my other hair. It would be best if you detangled with a tool - I like the Felicia Leatherwood brush. Detangling on dry hair is a no. I detangle on WAH (wet ass hair) with lots of conditioner before I wash my conditioner out. I like the slip because it makes the process faster, but some use oils and detangling sprays. 

I think you more so need a better detangling routine and night protection for your hair - there's a bunch of options. If you have silky hair, you may get away with a ponytail every night and taking it down in the morning. If your hair is coarse - no ma'am.

Beanz378,pdcv9d,"Stylist cut all of my hair off&&&So I tried to post about this when it happened last weekend but I was wayyyy too upset. I chopped my hair off two years ago and for my two year anniversary this year I wanted to get it straightened. Homegirl said my “ends had to go.” Fine, I’m never opposed to a trim. Walked out of there looking like a 5 year old. The cut is uneven, unwearable and two years of growth just went down the drain. I take really good care of my hair. Even if my ends needed to be trimmed I can’t see any reason why anyone would chop off 4-5 inches of hair especially without making it clear that this was what you were gonna do. By the time I saw what she had done it was too late. So then I’m thinking okay if my
Hair is gonna be shorter fine. I’m not one for confrontation especially when you have scissors in your hand. But then to not even give me something wearable? It looks like I cut it myself with kitchen scissors. 

This happened to me years ago when I was a teenager and it’s why I never went back to another salon. After this, I never will again 😩 it’s so discouraging.&&&Thank you this is such great advice&&&😩😩😩 thank you&&&That’s the thing I’d been trimming my own hair all of covid the exact same way. I guess that is what I’m going to keep doing while I try to grow it back. I’m going to learn to straighten it myself too because never again 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️&&&Yeah I totally get what you mean. Unfortunately my hair is superrrr uneven now. She didn’t give me an even cut after she straightened it. Now it looks even crazier curly. I usually blow out my hair to trim it at home so I really didn’t think it would warrant what she did. Personally I think she was probably trying to even it out as you say then realized she cut too much and so she just kept going. Then tried to tell me how I would notice such a difference in my hair the next time I washed it. Like yeah I noticed a difference. It’s gonna take forever to braid now because it’s short and uneven that’s what I noticed 🙄🙄🤦🏾‍♀️

But yeah I think you’re right. It’s better that I just keep my hair curly as my hair seems to thrive that way anyway. Besides, my scalp was/is still sore from whatever the heck she did. Never in my life! 🤦🏾‍♀️"
Fabulousness13,pdcv9d,Sorry to read this.  But honestly never ever let you voice not be heard!! Speak up for yourself since you’re the paying client. This has absolutely nothing to do with u being confrontational.  This is your hair!! She messed up and couldn’t fix it .. or at least give you something that would satisfy you.  I hope you didn’t pay her?? A trim and a cut are two different Servies.. not unless you agreed to the cut.
Mean_Tomatillo_9499,pdcv9d,"Im sorry! This happens to me every time I go to a salon, so I stopped going. After being natural for a decade, I believe I know my hair better than any stylist. I started doing my own trims during COVID by trimming the raggedy ends of two strand twists.  And after washing and conditioning, I spot trim ends that don't look great and call it a day. I want to learn to straighten next. At least if I end up with horrible hair, I'm responsible. I encourage you to keep learning your hair and doing your own styles."
aburney00,pdcv9d,This has happened to me and it really made me think. Personally this is what I have found. When you wear your hair curly the majority of the time and you get your hair trimmed or cut in it’s curly state it’s always “uneven” but never appears this way when you wear it curly. This is because every curl on your head is not the same length and is a different curl (some curls are tighter and some looser than others). When you finally straighten your hair the stylist will almost always say you need a trim/cut to even things out. Or your split ends become alarmingly clear when straightened. To have a decent straighten look you get those ends cut and it might look short but it looks healthy. Then when your done with wearing your hair straight and then wash it to wear it curly your hair will look crazy short and uneven in it’s curly state. This is because it was cut in a straighten state and does not take in account for how your hair hangs/looks when it is curly. So I decided to pick a side. I’ve decided to wear my hair curly and have been trimming my ends at home periodically. Maybe I’ll get it cut professionally but if I do it will be cut in it’s curly state. I might straighten my hair again but if I do I won’t sweat how my ends look seeing as though it only temporary because I’ve decided I’m team curly. I’ve found some exception to this general rule. Some women who have looser long curls all over seem to have the best ability to switch back and forth from curly to straight without looking crazy. But their straightened hair style will always be one length (without layers). So when they wear it curly it doesn’t look crazy.
happyhippoking,pdcv9d,"I'm so sorry this happened to you and you had such a bad experience. It's such a breach of trust and unprofessional.

If you do go to a stylist again, set up clear expectations and boundaries from the get-go. Tell them your goal is length and length retention. If you have to trim, ask them how much and have them show you how much. Watch them with a hand mirror. If you wear glasses, wear contacts if you have them, so you can see properly. Speak up and don't be afraid to leave mid-apppointment."
lolofreeb,pdcv9d,I’m dreading that when I go get my hair straightened. It’ll be my first time back in a salon in YEAAAAARS. That being said if they cut off more than I plan and I end up with my middle school bowl cut again (cuz they just hAd to bump them ends) I’ll just tell them to get rid of it all and dye it blonde 😌

Bearis4B,pda7c0,Is this a style or is it something that's done to stretch hair?
CndyKsses,pda7c0,I love to thread my hair; I like the look that it gives me because it's like a blowout without the heat
KamTC,pda7c0,dope!
YhouZee,pda7c0,"I'm Nigerian, I haven't made this style in over 12 years. 15 months since last relax and 9 months since chop, I decided to stretch my hair a bit and I'm wowed by the length I have so far.&&&&&&Thank you!&&&I trimmed my hair a little while installing it. I plan to make it in future, with smaller sections to get a more even trim. Ever tried trimming with it?&&&Yas! Can't wait to take it out&&&Thanks. It's both. It was a really common style, especially among children, when I was child. Nowadays you only find it in rural areas worn by old women. It's one of the most effective protective styles out there&&&Rubber threads. They're made into long hollow tubes and bundled together and they're sold really cheap in Africa. You can use yarn or fine cloth thread to achieve similar results.&&&Thank you!"
atomicoddball,pda7c0,So dope!!
blakppuch,pda7c0,It is a style that stretches your hair.
