_CoachMcGuirk,amwydn,"What do you mean eco styler gel is ""bad"" for you? "
brokeboyblues,amwydn,"Alternative gels&&&Apparently eco styler gel is bad for you, so does anybody have any healthy alternatives to it? &&&Thank u got the response!!! That makes sense&&&Badass!!!!&&&Idk I heard it has a bunch of chemicals, similar to the ones found in nail polishes remover, and it could overtime end up causing cancer. Not too sure but wouldn‚Äôt wanna risk it ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&&&It probably still worth checking out. I‚Äôll definitely look into it. Thank u so much!!!&&&Thank youuuu!!!"
conscious_bruja,amwydn,"I was a huge fan on eco styled gel up until very recently. Not sure if they altered their formula or what but I was noticing major flakes every time I used their gel to style my baby hair.

I switched to KeraCare‚Äôs Protein Styling Gel and couldn‚Äôt be happier! The flakes are gone and the gel maintains a great hold without a crunchy texture.

Please note that I only use gel to lay down my baby hair not to style my hair but I hope you find my suggestion helpful! 

"
curlgarden,amwydn,"You can see different YouTuber talk about cancelling eco gel. I think you have to do what best for you. If you like eco and it hasn‚Äôt done anything harmful to you or your hair and it works kept using it. 

The truth is cancelling one product does nothing if the rest of the products you use or harmful food you consume or makeup you use is just as bad. "
iamCHIC,amwydn,I make my own flaxseed gel. &&&I keep mine in the fridge. It‚Äôs sooo easy to make!  
AdamantiumFoil,amuq00,"I use a color applicator bottle with a thin nozzle for shampoo. Put a bit of shampoo in (1 oz or so) then fill it halfway with warm water, and shake it up. Then I put that directly on the scalp. I have really thick hair too and that's the only way I can make sure the shampoo makes it there. I use Silk Elements Olive Oil shampoo.

I saw huge improvement in my hair and scalp when I stopped washing it so often, tbh. I used to wash it every week and mix in a bit of dandruff shampoo, but that shampoo was too stripping and dried out my scalp even more! Now I only wash when my scalp tells me to and I see so much less flaking.

Give it a try! Don't give up!"
VaughnVapor,amuq00,Prepare for your life to change: this [scrub brush](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C965LZ8?pf_rd_p=c2945051-950f-485c-b4df-15aac5223b10&pf_rd_r=Y6R2M58KTEXF7BJTGH63) is magical
blackcannonball,amuq00,I have a history of eczema on my scalp (so more extreme than your typical dandruff) and I use neutrogena T/Gel shampoo on my scalp and follow with my normal shampoo and conditioner. After I use sulfur8 medicated anti-dandruff hair and scalp conditioner. 
brokeboyblues,amuq00,"Battling Dandruff&&&I have a sorta mini fro going on with an insanely itchy scalp. It‚Äôs really hard to get down into my scalp and clean it so I was wondering what u guys think should I shave my head or is there a way to take care of ur scalp with thick hair. Specific products would be appreciated!&&&Thank u so much for the response. If u don‚Äôt mind my asking how many times a week do u apply it,m? And how do u apply it?&&&Thank u for the support I‚Äôm trying to grow it out and the dandruff and itching has been discouraging. Omg the applicator bottle is fucking genius, I‚Äôll try it asap. One more question tho if u were to estimate how often u do wash ur hair what would u say?&&&That looks like just what I need. Thank u so much, it‚Äôs gonna make cleansing the scalp way easier.&&&Thank u!!!!!&&&Did u end up finding a solution?"
h007x,amuq00,"I‚Äôve been using Braggs Apple cider vinegar in water. I spray a 1:1 mixture in a spray bottle on my scalp and hair before i shampoo. I let it sit for about 10 mins and gets rid of dandruff better than any anti-dandruff shampoo I‚Äôve tried. Weirdly, I‚Äôve been doing this for over a year and notice now that my scalp is oilier than it was before. Also, ACV is a great detangler; that‚Äôs why I use it on my hair and scalp. Helps the comb glide easily "
pmunkyandpals,amuq00,"I have the same problem and shaving won't help. I shaved my back and sides a few years ago and, if anything, it just made it worse since there was no hair there to catch the flakes."
Eleanorrigbeee,amsvjz,"Go to a barber. It‚Äôs more complicated than just shaving your head. Specifically, go to a barber who understands the concept of shaving your head. If you can‚Äôt do that, at least have a friend do it. Do not do it yourself. Baldness is enough of a change without a shitty haircut."
Mynotredditaccount,amsvjz,I personally shaved my head on my own a few times and it worked out (: I honestly say go for it!
TunaSammich87,amsvjz,Go to a barber
UnsatisfiableStar,amsvjz,"I remember shaving it with the electric razor and doing it myself, going completely bald. I had a few cuts on my ears from doing it, but soap, witch hazel, and Neosporin go a long way. It's really up to you. I'm thinking of doing it again (but I'm better off not)."
afancysandwich,amsvjz,I would recommend going to a barber. But I wish you good luck!
fubuluv2001,amsvjz,barber please! i regret every impulsive decision ive made with my hair.

luckyseaturtle,amsvjz,"I've wanted the same for a while, but I'm too scared to do it. "
sj_81,amsvjz,Barber or a trusted friend (with experience) definitely. 
sunny_bell,amsvjz,"My sister did hers herself, I went to a barber. I must say going to a barber is preferable by a mile in terms of the finished look (plus after a couple of times my mom basically banned my sister from DIY haircuts)."
TSDTRT3i,ams1p0,"If she cut everything an even length this is a very normal shape to have. This is how my hair was shaped when I got my hair trimmed. 

Edit: I don‚Äôt think your hair looks uneven, I think it looks like it has multiple curl patterns "
reese81944,ams1p0,"I see what you mean, but it doesn‚Äôt look that bad to me. You could maybe play around with different styles or use a headband or some pins or something. But it looks fine as is. "
ringleadercurl,ams1p0,"Is there a hair cut/trim that could fix this or should I let it grow out?&&&So the hairdresser cut my hair to this weird shape it‚Äôs like a downward triangle. It looks ok when wet but when it dries it looks terrible. My hair has different curl patterns all over so maybe it happened when she cut it wet and she tried to cut it where everything is a even length. Idk


I‚Äôm letting it grow out but damn the shape is still there. I‚Äôm trying to grow out my hair and I don‚Äôt wanna make my hair shorter, but at the same time it sucks not having to even wear your hair down because of the shape.


Here are some pics. My hair looks messy and dry cause I just took it out of pig tails and I haven‚Äôt really moisturized it in a few days lol

Edit: pics deleted 
&&&I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs uneven it just has a upside down triangle shape that I dislike. What shape will give it a better shape when dry?"
vdbwahoo,ams1p0,I just came to comment that I think it's cute!
cocolanoire,amq7gh,"Make sure you blend the overripe bananas and sieve the mixture to remove seeds and other lumps. Mix the banana blend with yoghurt, coconut milk and honey - amounts depend on your hair length. Also add oil of choice, teaspoon of henna, egg or Shea butter if you wish. Apply to damp hair and leave for 30mins to and hour. Either shampoo or co-wash to remove from hair. Et voil√†!

Edited to add: final step is to rinse the washed hair with ACV mixed with water. It will help to remove the banana smell"
netergold,amq7gh,"Have you ever used a banana hair mask before?&&&Hi, I'm Mike and I'm currently looking for new hair mask and such to try in my hair so I can post it to my YouTube channel (netergold) and help educate my customers on their benefits and such. If you'd be so kind as to drop links to some amazing things I need to try on my hair I would GREATLY appreciate it!&&&I love the smell of bananas lol. I had mine in and I should have used my blender, my IG fam said use some baby food. I mixed it with a few things from my shop so it was pretty dope. Hair was hella shiny "
yourbestbudz,amq7gh,It was a complete mess for me. Haired smelled like bananas for days. 
Bakergoals,ammlf2,"rice water fermentation&&&ok so i made rice water a few weeks ago. Do you yall think the rice water is okay to use? or should i just make more?&&&no i just threw it out! it was horrible lol &&&Sorry you guys im never on here anymore....WORK!!!! i made new rice water a couple weeks ago... i like the 30 mins better, for smell and wait time lol thanks guys"
PoetryRaven,ammlf2,"I'm sure it's super potent and smelly now.  Your best bet is to make a new batch. Each time you use the rice water,  try to make only enough for a one time use.  If you do choose to use the old batch,  dilute it in water and maybe add some essential oils to combat the smell. "
StarChildArt,ammlf2,"I haven't tried it yet, but I think people usually just let it sit for like 30mins to overnight at the longest. After a few weeks, you might have Sake on your hands üòÇ"
StarChildArt,ammdjl,"DIY Black Soap Shampoo question&&&Hi all
I just made a batch of DIY African Black Soap shampoo. I basically followed a Naptural85 tutorial, but I tweaked it. 
I recently came across the debate on whether or not this stuff will expire and should be refrigerated. People were talking about both their DIY products and the black soap itself.

I used Raw black soap, sweet almond oil, neem oil, peppermint essential oil, and vitamin e oil. None of these things really have a short shelf life on their own, but like I said, some people seem to refrigerate their DIY shampoo and some just leave it out. I feel like it'll just separate and solidify  if I refrigerate it.

Has anyone made their own shampoo before? If so, did you need to preserve it in some way or did you just leave it out?&&&Yeah, I'm not sure why it would even go bad since none of the ingredients really do? I don't know. I'm just gonna leave it out and see what happens. I have a massive block of soap to start over with if it actually rots"
_CoachMcGuirk,ammdjl,"i keep it refridgerated, and bring it out 30 minutes or so before it's time to wash my hair."
yourbestbudz,ammdjl,I made the same with different oils. Never had a problem with shelf life. I made an average size shampoo bottle and it lasted. No spoilage. 
Jassitaa,amm8qj,"I‚Äôm always looking for a new treatment, what did you do for it?"
Jazzers88,amm8qj,"Honey & Olive Oil&&&I did a hot honey and olive oil treatment. Brruuuhh, I thought I found the most moisturizing products for my hair type already but this combo  has changed the game for me lol. Then I blew my hair out and it‚Äôs soooooooooo soft still. Like I know for a fact this will last me until next week, NO DOUBTS!&&&First I put honey in a microwaveable bowl (or measuring cup for spout purposes) for 30secs. Then I juss add the olive oil and stir. Afterwards, I pour it into an applicator bottle and apply. I always apply in 8 sections. So I applied with the applicator then my go to deep conditioner from the Texture ID line. Then I let it sit under my heat gel cap for 15-20mins and rinsed out in the shower. "
PoetryRaven,amm8qj,Honey is surprisingly good for natural hair.  More people need to try this! 
Tacox706,amm8qj,I mix honey into my clay wash and olive oil in my hair oil. Both are LIFE. I notice a difference if I forget the honey in my clay wash. It is everything. Glad you found a combo that works for you!
deliminal,aml4ej,"Can I relate? Maybe when I first started growing my hair out but I got over it once I learned pretty much everyone thinks everyone else has it better. 

* People with straight hair complain about oiliness and want beach waves. 
* People with beach waves complain about limpness and want Botticelli curls. 
* People with Botticelli curls complain about volume and want what us kinky-coily and afro textures get for free. 

I sympathize with your allergies and sensitivity struggles but looser curl patterns aren't immune to that either. Not to mention, people without allergies and sensitivities still have to figure out their hair's  quirks, accept them, and learn to work with instead of against them before things fall into place.

My point is, the struggle is pretty universal. As long as you're not mistreating your hair, it will strengthen and grow. Just focus on maximizing your potential and try to stop worrying about all the ""what-ifs"" that will never be. Chances are that for as much as you hate your hair, there's someone out there that would make a dark bargain for a chance it. Even if there isn't, the only person who's love your hair needs is your own. Give it that and you can't go wrong. "
journey1992,aml4ej,"Ugh... my fine and low porosity curls are so high maintenance!!!&&&Ugh... my fine and low porosity curls are so high maintenance!!!

I just wanna shave my low porosity, fine 3c/4a hair off or wake up with looser 3b silky curls with normal porosity and medium/thick strands.

My hair is so needy, sensitive, and picky about what ingredient it likes. I have to make my own hair conditioners now because of the allergies I have.. and so I can‚Äôt help to notice how high maintenance it is! It likes a little bit of oil sometimes but not too much and not every-time otherwise I get build up and/or the oil locks moisture out of my hair and it is dry and unable to be combed. My hair is also protein sensitive and need to be clarified often because it is so fine and low porosity. Also the shrinkage is killer unless I use a gel like flaxseed but now I am allergic to flaxseed so I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna go. And my hair easily breaks because it‚Äôs so fine so it‚Äôs best when I don‚Äôt even  manipulate or style it much. 
I don‚Äôt like my hair!!! It is so i unpredictable! I wish I could do the same thing every time I do my hair and it liked it! Now my hair only likes slippery elm, BtMS, and cetearyl alcohol! Why can‚Äôt my hair be more easy going and be able to look good with more ingredients and products. Why did I get stuck with this hair? Anyone else relate?

I just want pretty long hair. Girls with straighter hair have it so much easier.&&&Play around with different amounts of BTMS, cetearyl alcohol, distilled water, preservative... some people add oil and other extracts. Google search recipes. Curlytea is a good resource "
urawizrdarry,aml4ej,How do you make your conditioner? I just made a post looking for this because I live in a country without natural hair products and they're expensive to order. Your hair sounds just as stubborn as mine and now I can't get to my products without over paying.
chapine,amcflr,"Product Recommendations for Transitioning Hair?&&&I have low porosity 4c hair 


YAWL. I am tired. I've been transitioning since September and I have about an inch of new growth when it's stretched. My natural hair is super dry and brittle while my relaxed ends are oily and over-moisturized? I obviously want to focus on my new growth, but the breakage of the relaxed portion is unreal. I've been changing products once a week and I just need something that works. The Shea Moisture JBCO deep treatment masque used to be a holy grail for my relaxed hair but it still leaves my natural hair wanting more. I've included what I've used below. 


Week 1: Aunt Jackie's line

Week 2: the Mane choice line  

Week 3: Miss Jessie's line

Week 4: Cantu line

Week 5: Shea Moisture line


Other products that work well on relaxed hair but not my natural hair that I've used: Hawaiian Silky 14-in-1, Garnier Honey line. 


I used TGIN deep conditioner early on when I started transitioning and that was so awful on my relaxed hair. 


By line, I mean that brand's shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner, and creams. NOTHING has been satisfactory and I'm at my wits' end and YouTubers are liars and I just want soft, moisturized hair. PLEASE help me. I'm on my hands and knees in a pool of my tears. Should I just be focusing on my new growth? "

Blergh_MaGerks,am83t0,"I really like Camille Rose naturals original line. I think a good bit of it is protein free, and it definitely is glycerine free (at least the ginger wash, the pear conditioner, the curl love and the curl maker). "
Mollywobbles,am83t0,"I know people have mixed feelings about Shea Moisture, but they have a protein-free line specifically for low porosity. It has gotten pretty good reviews, from what I‚Äôve seen. "
banana-n-oatmeal,am83t0,"I also like Camille Rose naturals products.
Also OP , make sure you use some kind of heat when you deep condition. It does all the difference for my low porosity hair... Buying a heating cap was a game changer in my routine."
blueabby24,am83t0,"I have protein sensitive 4c hair that's low porosity. I had a grudge with shea moisture BUT the only thing that keeps my hair moisturized and soft and manageable is that low porosity line.  The smell can be either a hit or miss depending on your preference because its made with like tea tree oil, the smell doesnt bother me it goes away after like sinks into the hair.

I have wasted so much money trying to find products ( especially deep conditioners) that are protein free because my hair reacts so badly with it. When I think I have found something protein free and try to put it in my hair it always ends up having ignored some ingredient that is secretly a protein. I was just wondering if you guys had ANY suggestions for protein free natural hair products, whether they can be bought or made, because I'm really lost."

Ace_Turnip,alcucd,"If you're doing everything right and your hair is breaking or shedding excessively, you might have internal issues. If you haven't done so already, get your blood leveks checked and watch out for ferritin and hemoglobin. Ferritin should be above 75 for healthy hair growth. If not those, it could be vitamin d, b12 or thyroid.

JBCO is the solution. Seriously.

Jojotherabbit123,alcucd,"Take biotin. Drink a lot of water because you can break out, but it‚Äôs amazing for hair and nails. 

Deep conditioner and hot oil has saved my life. Deep conditioner (apply at you ends then roots) keeps your actual strand in tact and the hot oil (Jamaican black castor with others is godly) to make sure my scalp is healthy and ready for growth. 

I stopped using heat completely and I shampoo once a month and it helped the shedding. I am learning that regular detangling can help, also trimming my hair helps prevent knots, split ends and it really helps my hair flourish. "
LivinModNatRH,alcucd,"Hello sorry about your hair breakage. Maybe you should look into using Ayurvedic herbs to recover your scalp. The herbs that I've used over the years are Alma, Brahmi, Neem, Shikaikai, and Aritha. These herbs can be used as a paste for a treatment mask for your hair and scalp and also as an infusion oil for your scalp with carrier oils such as coconut, avocado, olive, etc. These herbs promote hair growth, fights hair loss, fights dandruff, and it does so much more. You can find these herbs simply by going to Amazon.com or Google search them or you can go to your local Indian stores and ask if they have those herbs I mentioned. I hope this helps"
