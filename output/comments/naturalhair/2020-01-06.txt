Someone1Somewhere,enyxe1,"in what order is it best to apply: Leave-In, Oil, then Gel, or Leave-In, Gel, then Oil?&&&&&&Thanks for your insights! It seems like it's best to put everything you use to seal in moisture, under your product that's for hold&&&I never thought about switching the oil and leave-in order; what makes you decide to do that?"
boopalooo,enyxe1,"Depends on the product! Some products just don’t mix well. Like for me ECO styler usually doesn’t work if I have an oil or certain leave ins on under it. My current go to is the honey pomegranate line from Mielle with their leave in, JBCO, and their coil custard on top. No flakes, great definition."
itsrik9,enyxe1,"For me, I do leave-in, cream, gel (optional), oil. I also sometimes don’t put oil, because it doesn’t play well with my hair unless I’m using it to scrunch out the crunch."
myvibeiztremendous,enyxe1,"I do oil, leave-in then gel. Sometimes I may switch the order of oil and LI. 

Water > oil > leave in > twisting butter > gel 👈🏽 that’s what I do."
AJG4222,enyfkh,Nice! Looks great 👍
DollXIX,enyfkh,"Yasss, honey your twist out is beautiful!"
IIBVGBXRTHV,enyfkh,"Alright y’all, I wanted to give a hair update. I finally let my twists out today after about a week or so. Still the same ones from the triangle parts video. Here’s the final result. Don’t mind the funny faces 😂😂&&&&&&Haha thanks😊&&&Thank you friend! You peep what’s going onnnn lol&&&Thanks friend :)&&&Preciate that friend!💛&&&Thank you for the compliment friend🧡. I used to wear glasses all my life until last summer, so I could never really see em. Now I can really appreciate em."

americhum,enxgj2,"  ColorOops worked really great for me, it just smells like eggs 🤢"
autumnwatum,enxgj2,What’s the best way to remove as much blue/green dye as possible? 😭&&&
brainsweeties,enxgj2,"But its so pretty don't do it 😭 lol jk, bleach it or use one of those color remover kits, which are really just bleach but are supposed to be less damaging than straight bleach powder. I think straight bleach would remove more of the dye but it's up to you."
graveyardmalibu,enxgj2,You can try a clarifying shampoo. I've used Tresemme (cheap) and it took me two washes to get red dye out.  Fair warning: it may be very drying to the hair
idkmybffdw,enxgj2,"The most success I've had removing any color is from mixing a clarifying shampoo with vinegar and baking soda and letting it sit. Removing green specifically (and this is going to sound C R A Z Y and I'm 99% sure it worked because of the vinegar content and red color but...) Ketchup (only works if it's mostly already faded and you just wanna get rid of the green tint). 

For either of these let it sit on your hair for an hour minimum."
lunarstars6,enxgj2,idk the answer to your question but this is gorgeous omg

taylorikari,enuzpl,"You’re fucking joking. Sir, your bone structure is wild"
ProfessionalBinger_,enl50t,Growth from October to Present || currently twisting it up to deep condition&&&
MsHurricane,enf3y3,"I wouldn’t as you’ll likely alter the floof. Trust me, been there done that TWICE, and with heartbreaking consequences. The colors end up looking amazing on us but severely dry our hair. The most fun alternative I found is hair coloring wax. Those not only show up in our hair but plays up the fun cotton candy like quality of our hair."
Oneofthesecatsisadog,enf3y3,"Your hair is beautiful and nearly anything that you could successfully color it with (since it is dark) would slightly alter the texture, permanently. You could use colored powders or waxes intended for it temporarily for fun though."
SqueakyCog,enf3y3,Sure.
TheWiltingOrchid,enf3y3,"I heard there’s colored wax. Maybe you could experiment? Personally I’d never alter my hair again after the damage it went through and the recovery journey. 

It’s up to you though! It would look cool either way, but it looks so healthy, be gentle. 😍"
dyam,enf3y3,No self promotion.
grammargirl8,enf3y3,Your fro is amazing! Use hair paint wax. It washes out and is very gentle.
itscoolyy,enf3y3,Sis do whatever you want to do. But know you are solid!!!!
luvmypurplelipstick,enf3y3,No. It's beautiful!
montero19,enf3y3,Y’all I’m getting hair envy again cuz look at the material 😭😭😭😭✨
stazasmr,enf3y3,Should I dye my hair? This is my natural color ... follow me @saywordstaz on INstagram&&&
Ashleyjasmine,enagal,"Uncle funky’s daughter gel, texture is styling creme, cantu curl activator, kinky curl gel, Taliah wajid curly curl cream, cantu twist and lock gel are all some gels/stylers that have pretty good reviews on YouTube. Personally I really like the uncle funky’s daughter gel but it can get a bit sticky if your hair isn’t wet enough"
Mrseducated,enagal,"I use the camille rose curl maker with Style caster edge booster gel. I can cause some flakes if you dont get the ratio just right, but Im currently rocking a 6 day old wash and go and besides some frizz, its nice. I use it for twist-outs too with a lighter hand and ive never had an issue.&&&Pic...  https://imgur.com/YPjSdRZ"
kkheart20,enagal,"Alternative to Gel for styling?&&&Hi! So I believe I have high porosity, medium density type 4 hair. I've noticed that while everyone  seems to loooove Wetline or Eco, they  just dry my hair out so much no matter what creams, leave-ins and oils I coat my strands with prior. Which is really frustrating. For wash and goes I've started using the Camille Rose curl maker which I love. but I wanted something stronger for my twistouts/braid outs because its usually a mess by the end of the first day cause it just not strong enough. What can I use in my hair to hold my twist outs for a couple of days and keep my hair moisturized?&&&https://imgur.com/XcYIvxv

This is day 4 hair. I usually can never wear my day 4 hair down&&&wow, thank you! I will try that. your hair looks very pretty&&&Just an update. I tried it and it’s amazing!! Thank you so much"
Antonio321123,en7yu3,you are the average of those you glide with&&&
graceyperkins,en7yu3,I love those earrings.
Cheez30,emz86t,"Does cantu curling cream moisturize hair and help hair grow?&&&I know there is some type of cantu shea butter that helps hair grow by moisturizing and all that. But theres like tons of cantu products and i dont know which one is the one. I got the cantu curling cream but idk if its doing anything. Btw im male. Does this do anything or just enchane curls, coils and thats it..?&&&Dang ive been noticing that too. Is there a way to keep it from drying or not. Should i just keep using it after it drys or is it a bad idea"
TimTamDeliciousness,emz86t,"I used it for awhile but I actually found that it dried my hair out so I used a deep conditioning leave-in as a base. 

It definitely defines curls well but I didn’t notice any change in hair growth."
kkheart20,emz86t,I personally don't like any Cantu products. they're all very drying to my hair.  Maybe try a different brand's curling cream that's designed to help define curls and keep it moisturized
ElectricWordLife,emz3ex,"If you are taking good care of your hair and your twists aren't too tight, you should be fine with what you are doing. 2 strand twists have been my goto hairstyle for a few years and really help it grow. (My hair is type 4 and below my waist.)

I just suggest making sure you switch up the parting from time to time so you don't keep parting in the exact same spots."
d9niels9n,emz3ex,"[question] Can protective styles damage hair?&&&I’m a guy. I’ve had my hair in two strand twists for about 7 months. I undo them to wash/condition and moisturize my hair every 3-4 weeks, and have them retwisted before I get a cut (fade and line-up). So my question is, is this potentially damaging my hair? Should I go a while without having my hair twisted or is this routine sustainable for my hair?"
montero19,emz3ex,Protective style are only damaging when your not taking care of them. Ex: if the hair happens to be too tight or your not moisturizing them properly. But it’s always recommended to give the hair a week or two to breath and be out before reapplying another protective  style
Mynotredditaccount,emytnu,"Omg, all adorable! D: I can't pick a favorite 😄"
luvslasthope,emytnu,My best crochet styles of 2019!&&&
naissas,emytnu,Have you tried out https://crownlocs.com? They sell natural looking crochet goddess locs at an affordable price.
xPastelFox,emytnu,Second row on the bottom right??? I need answers!!
JDnice804,emxof8,Your hair will more than likely revert. I’m sure you’re in good shape if you only did one pass with the flat iron. Be sure to deep condition!
Pikachu42,emxof8,"Reversion Paranoia&&&OK. So, I got a blow out for Christmas, and because of a series of events I haven't been able to wash my hair until now. Honestly, guys, I am so scared my hair won't revert! I'm dreading the thought of washing it tomorrow. I'm watching reversion videos just freaking out!&&&I'm going to do a hot oil treatment and deep condition. Not taking any chances!"
ayewussup,emxglt,Dope af
comparablebeast,emxglt,"Suave, oooh you’re so suave!"
d9niels9n,emxglt,I actually have the same question
dsighbot,emxglt,hey do you put anything in your beard I have the same cut on mine and its full but I want it to look a bit fuller ? if that makes sense lol
originalsoul,emxglt,Freshly washed mini twists and a light beard trim on a lazy Friday.&&&&&&Thanks!&&&If I'm using shampoo then I wash them with a durag or a wave cap on.&&&Just natural oils and a little shea butter. I comb it twice a day or more to train the hairs to lie in the same direction. Trimming is also really important to give it a good shape. Apart from that it just takes time to look full. I've been growing mine for close to 3 months now.
slut4dior,emxglt,Very handsome.
sugarblocks218,emxglt,How do you wash your twists without them getting messed up?
