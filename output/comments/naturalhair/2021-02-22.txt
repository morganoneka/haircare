bmariefaye,lu27tr,"Wash and go using all Camille Rose hair products ❣️&&&&&&Thank you 🤗&&&My routine: Sweet Ginger Cleansing Rinse, Moroccan Pear Conditioning Custard, Curl Love Moisture Milk, and of course the one and only Curl Maker. Shingled/finger coiled every hair on my head. Diffused on cool in high speed. Scrunched out the cast in the morning with some oil on my hands. Used a pick for some volume.&&&Thank you! I style with my fingers only. I finger detangle in the shower too. I’ve noticed I don’t shed as much hair by using my fingers as my hair tools&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you! I’m growing out a tapered cut&&&This comment got me out of bed. Thank you for the motivation 😂 it’s a cheap lipstick I picked up at Ulta on sale. It’s Wet n Wild “Sexpot Red”&&&Thank you very much. I’m not always this put together, but lately I’ve been trying to make a special effort&&&Thank you! 💕&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you love! Yes, put that effort into your hair. It’ll make you feel so good 🤗 “I’m growing out” a tapered hair cut. My sides were shaved down really low and my stylist tapered it to where it faded from shorter sides to the longer parts of my hair. It was the struggle growing my sides out!"
corysilk,lu27tr,I love your shape!!
fillumcricket,lu27tr," Gorgeous and your lipstick is perfection, too. Can I ask what shade it is?"
flirtandflutter,lu27tr,"WOW...this is a level of put together I will never achieve, you are gorgeous! Love the lipstick with earrings combo!! And of course your hair is ridiculously perfect too!"
luv-u-3000,lu27tr,Perfection. 🤩
violetladyjane,lu27tr,I absolutely loveeeee your hair. I have the same curl type and 6 months ago I did a big chop! Went from just past shoulder length to like 1-2 inches all around. So I love seeing your routine.. I have been lazy with mine for awhile and not trying to get curl definition all the time (can’t see it on zoom calls so I haven’t cared ha) but now I’m going to try a bit harder. When you say you are growing into a tapered shape what does that mean?
Brooklyn_Rais,ltzrwn,Great job for first time. Just remember to always conceal the ends and raw edges of the fabric.
Its_a_me21,ltzrwn,Looks good sis!!
Lucidia,ltzrwn,"You're rocking it!

Alas, my head shape makes these things slide riiiiight off"
luckyseaturtle,ltzrwn,Nice job! This is gonna sound weird but it makes me want a cinnamon bun. 😂
tee2670,ltzrwn,Today i tried a knot for the first time ! How did it turn out ? Any tips ?&&&&&&Thankyou for the tip! :)&&&Heh! I always want a cinnamon bun !&&&Thankyou :) !&&&Thankyou so much! Heh I have no idea how to do the front off my hair so I tried this! Happy to know it turned out okay also yeah ... I have a big head so it didn’t slip off :)
flirtandflutter,ltxktq,"Shampoo tangles my hair too....so I'll post what helps me w/r/t shampooing:

* Alternate with cowashing - but actual cowashing with cleansing ingredients like  Coco betaine. Cowashing does not tangle my hair nearly as badly
* When I do use shampoo, which is more often now, I use a sulfate free shampoo. It's really the sulfate that dries out my hair and makes it tangle like crazy
* Before shampooing, if I know my hair is a tangled mess, I pre-poo. Sometimes this means wetting and applying a deep conditioner that sits for a while before shampooing. Sometimes it means oiling my hair before shampooing - I can still clean my scalp, but it creates a protective barrier between the shampoo and my hair. 
* Please note, if you do drop sulfates and start cowashing, you will need to also drop silicones, because silicones can only be removed by sulfates. This will limit what conditioners, stylers, etc you can use"
udon_whore,ltxktq,"i need product recommendations (3b/c)&&&I've been using coconut oil and water like my whole life and brands like tresemme. 
My hair is 3b/c and low porosity. Using most shampoo has my hair so tangled and dry and frizzy to the point where I spent hours detangling it while crying 😂. So usually I only use shampoo occasionally (I know that's not good but im so tired of my hair). 
Anyway I need product recommendations for like everything and please don't reccomend cantu or aussie. 
My budget is £30 because I have to spend my own money on this."

kabudhiblohj,ltwqnt,I met with a black cosmetic chemist recently and this is what I learned&&&
koalabunbun,ltwqnt,Very informative I hope to start my own Cosmetics brand thank for sharing.
CaneK79,ltso5m,"I feel you. My hairline has been throwing me peace signs for years now (I thought it was normal since I have thin hair and it would eventually grow back...wrong) I’ve tried almost everything except this blend they be talking about; Peppermint oil and lavender oil the list goes on but these 2 keep popping up. You can mix one or both of the oils with castor oil or whatever blend you want to use. I do suggest doing your own research first because haven’t tried it yet but apparently they can resurrect hair follicles that has given up on life. 

Hopes this helps."
iambeyoncealways3,ltso5m,"Traction Alopecia&&&Hey y’all. First post here. I have been struggling with traction alopecia for about 1.5-2 years now. I started wearing (for the first time end of 2018) my hair in really tight, top knot, “pineapple” style for a few months until I started noticing my hair thinning in the back. It started has a really small patch that I fixated on at work while it was straightened but never gave it much thought. I stopped wearing like that has often (spring of 2019) and wore it straight or in braids. Throughout 2020 I saw it get worse and worse. I would part my hair in different places taking pictures and notice not a lot of hair growing in that area. As the year went on and early into 2021 the patches got wider and now my scalp seems paler and the hair that is still holding on seems thinner. When a few strains come out I feel nothing and the little bulbs that are usually on the roots of your hair are nonexistent. 
I’ve tried wild hair growth, no tight styles, box braids (even thought I know that’s not good, I’ve worn box braids off and on my entire life and this type of hair loss never happened) leaving it as a fro, constantly wearing a wrap even to work and it’s just not bringing my hair back. So much research has made me even more depressed about this. Some sites say there is no recovering and it’s now permanent. I can’t afford to see a dermatologist right now and hair transplants are thousands of dollars I don’t have. I miss my hair so much. Does anyone have advice besides wearing wigs forever or shaving my head?

TLDR; suffering from traction alopecia, tried a few things, fear it is too late to turn back. suggestions?&&&I will definitely try this. I hope it help you as well! This hair loose thing will really have you down in the dumps for real."

Blaque-Cat,ltmnlc,Hair growth and loss are internal. Try taking biotin and finasteride.
OnlyForThemComments,ltmnlc,I've used it mixed with Jamaican caster oil and it worked well for me
arincer,ltmnlc,"i wouldnt recommend it for bald spots. people say wild growth oil and jbco help with balding, but i can’t say i notice a difference with the use of topical hair products."
youssef425,ltmnlc,"Is Almond Oil good for your hair?&&&Would almond oil be good for my hair to help make it healthy and reduce male pattern baldness? If not, what should I use?"
Ihave0friendzer0,ltm709,"So I used to use it before they changed formula, probably around 2014ish, my hair loved the stuff, then the next year my hair started drying out and breaking off and I couldn't under why so I kept adding more Cantu products to my routine only for it to get worse, and them my scalp started breaking out in sores and big scaly patches of dandruff. Anyway I found out they'd changed their formula and they added alcohol to it and other stuff, so I stopped using it. Once I stopped all those problems went away. I haven't bought their products since then. I use Aunt Jackie's, The Doux, Curls, and Twistedsista."
youssef425,ltm709,Is Cantu damaging for your hair?&&&I've recently gotten a couple of cantu products like the curling cream and the conditioner. I was just wondering if it would damage my hair after long term usage. I'm just trying to reduce any chance of male pattern baldness.
