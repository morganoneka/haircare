DreadfulLove,fvockq,"Is this as defined and controlled as I can get?&&&&&&Like in what way?&&&This is a breakthrough. I’ve never successfully executed a ‘wash n go’ until now. These curls looks so cute, but I’m struggling to see how the thickness of my hair will ever let me wear it very defined and without it frizzing up as it dries. 

Hair care routine on week-old untouched hair:

1. Drench hair, add mix of Shea moisture’s curl enhance smoothie + Shea moisture’s conditioning gel + Shea butter 

2. Oil mix

3. Let dry a bit and apply generous amount of coconut oil

4. Revive with spray bottle, add mix of Shea moisture’s moisture retention conditioner + Shea moisture’s curl stretch cream, + eco styler gel

5. Tea tree oil mix to the scalp + massage scalp&&&Hahaha. Thank you!&&&Wow that sounds like an additional 40mn for my routine aha. Man my hair is so much to handle. 

But, noted on the coconut oil. So you would recommend I just do that once dry.&&&Oh yea? Okay thank you! What do you think about coconut oil? My hair loves it and gets nice and soft. But Argan is also great and olive oil. And shae is great for my high porosity hair. So it’s hard to choose lol."
Queen_kayt,fvockq,You might need to individually work with the curls.
Urfavorganiccheeto,fvockq,Maybe your hair is high porosity? And does your hair products contain a lot of humectants like glycerin or honey? Humectants will make your hair really frizzy and undefined if not used in the correct weather or if your hair is high porosity.
dyam,fvockq,"You may have to work in sections, and use the prayer hand method.

Also, I think applying the coconut oil when it’s  halfway dry may undo all of the styling and cause some frizzing. I think the best way to get definition is to apply all products while the hair is still soaking wet, and then let it air dry or use a diffuser. You can add more oil if you want afterward, but I would wait until it’s completely dry and use the prayer hand method."
lowercaselibby,fvockq,Your hair looks AMAZING but your face looks like you've been possessed
randomizer302,fvockq,Absolutely. I just need to sort out how to post pictures
rossablue,fvockq,I think you may be adding too much oil. I don’t use oil at all and apply my products on wet hair.
SugarsDimples,fvdvvz,"Wash & Go: Second Day Hair (see comment for answered questions)&&&&&&I couldn’t figure out how to add this picture to my post from yesterday (forgive me, I’m a Reddit newb) so here’s the picture of day 2 of my W&G. It was the end of the day & fully dry. 

I refresh my coils by spraying it in the morning; water, conditioner & a light carrier oil (almond, avocado, vitamin e)

Also, someone told me to cross post into the Black Hair community...I’m having difficulty with that (🤦🏾‍♀️) Do I need to join first? I’m still trying to figure this all out. Help a sista out fam!

Oh & since I had a few inquires about location/ethnicity....I am a (American) Blasian Afro Latina Yardi! 🇯🇲🇨🇳🇵🇷 (I know!🤣)&&&Of course! 5’2”☺️"

EloquentElixir,fvchgl,"Yes they can! Certain oils will be absorbed into your scalp/hair shaft and others will not. Coconut oil is great! JBCO however, is not because it's too thick and will just sit on top of your scalp/hair strands. You should try lighter oils like jojoba, sweet almond, macadamia etc."
VLonetaee,fvchgl,Can oils be left on for multiple days?&&&I been washing my oils out my head for awhile. Usually the following morning. I use black castor oil and coconut oil.&&&When is the best time to apply jbco?

You look good!!"
511lonette,fv75ai,"In my opinion, oil shouldn't be washed out."
EloquentElixir,fv75ai,"You can leave oils in your head without needing to wash them out- if you wash them away, you're stripping the benefits you just gave your hair.

Coconut oil is great, but ditch the JBCO for your scalp. It's too thick and will just sit on your scalp/hair strands. Use lighter oils like Baobab, Sweet Almond, Macadamia etc"
VLonetaee,fv75ai,Just scapped my fro. Growing from scratch and have a few questions?&&&I was told to much oil can be bad for a healthy scalp. I use black castor oil and coconut oil. I apply a lil amount to my scalp on nights before wash day. I leave the oils in overnight and wash them out with shampoo followed by conditioner the following morning. I do this about 1-2x a week. Is this routine good? I don’t wanna over do it on the oil. I also heard you can apply oil after a wash?&&&Care to explain&&&Cuz u been washing my oils out this whole time lol&&&Ok gotcha. How many times would I use coconut oil a week. I wash my hair like 1-2x a week
chocolatequickk,fv46ds,Prepoo can help with detangling. your favorite oils and conditioner or African Pride Pre Shampoo is a good cheap alternative and do wash day as usual. or find a conditioner with a lot of slip or a deep conditioner that allows you to detangle. you can also find a leave in with slip i like the kinky curly knot today it’s expensive but works
csowell107,fv46ds,Detangling hair&&&What type of conditioner should I detangling hair with? Rinse out? Leave in? Or deep conditioner?
wildhuntressophelia,fv46ds,"Any conditioner is okay to detangle with as long as it provides the slip you need to detangle. I find it easier to detangle at the prepoo stage and put my hair in twists for the wash process because washing it out tends to tangle it. 

The Africa pride coconut and aloe pre poo is great (like the other poster said) and Camille rose deep conditioners are not bad for detangling or Aussie moist but that has silicones in it."
Guacamole363,fv3pl8,"Honestly it just sounds like a waste of deep conditioner, however if you did I’d suggest shampooing first so you don’t get buildup and the deep conditioner can really penetrate 🤷🏾‍♀️"
csowell107,fv3pl8,"Deep Condition every other day&&&Hi, I know deep Conditioning this much isn’t recommended but I saw a challenge with people doing it and they grew a lot of hair in a little bit of time. I wanna try it. Would it be best if I shampoo before all the conditioning or just deep condition?"
katsqaz,fv3pl8,"I agree, shampoo first. I wouldn't recommend this challenge in my opinion because it sounds like too much moisture. Our hair needs a balance of protein and moisture. It can get mushy, frizzy and lack definition if it has moisture overload."
CoffeeB4Talkie,fv10y9,I think DC at the most should be weekly. I only DC when I shampoo.
XxPrinceLightskinxX,fv10y9,"I suggest doing it every other day. You don't want to DC every day, or your hair can get very mushy and lose its bounce.

So every 2-3 days is perfect. It's good to do it after shampooing because the shampoo takes a lot of natural oils and curl density out of your hair."
csowell107,fv10y9,Deep conditioning&&&Do I have to deep condition only when I shampoo or can I do it more frequently then I shampoo?
csowell107,fv0xm7,"Cantu not curling my hair&&&Hi, I used to use Cantu all the time when I had somewhat short hair. I stopped for a good year and a half because I started sponging my hair. I went back to using the Cantu coconut curling cream recently and it does not curl my hair anymore like it use to(if it even curls it now) my hair just gets really frizzy but not a lot of curls are visible. Does my hair need to get back use to the product or...?"
AnalTattoo,futogw,Nice hair
DaniMrynn,futogw,FLUUUUFF ❤
lejazzy,futogw,"Combed out my curls, natural state&&&&&&Thanks!&&&Yessss!! Gotta love the fluff"
Guacamole363,fut407,"Anyone else have straight hairs within your Afro?&&&I big chopped last November, and as my hair is growing out I’ve noticed that I have quite a number naturally bone straight strands of hair? Does anyone else have this and know why it happens? For reference I think I have a mix of 3c and 4a/b hair.&&&It really is weird isn’t it, It could just be genetics I think! It’s frustrating tho having a wash and go and there are just lil straight hairs poking out 😩"
OG_PunchyPunch,fut407,Same. I have 3b/3c mix but the right front patch of my hair is barely wavy.  I've been natural for 10 years so I've learned to accept and work with it but it's still annoying.
Urfavorganiccheeto,fut407,I have some straight hairs in my hair too lol
atctia,fut407,"Same here! I've got 4b hair, but there are a few strands sprinkled in that are just straight. At first I thought but was heat damage until I realized it was growing like that."
lteesh,fut407,4C here! I’ve been natural my whole life with minimal heat styling and have three or four bone-straight strands around the back of my head.
mb83,fut407,Yes! I just big chopped a few weeks ago and I have a patch on the left side that’s kind of wavy but not curly at all. It kind of bums me out because I like my curls and that part just seems frizzy. I’d love to know how to make it curl.
moamne,fut407,"Yes!! All on one side too! My sister once in a while (after forgetting the last time) will try to pull them thinking it’s dead hair, and I have to quickly respond and say “it’s my hair! It’s my hair!”"
peachesandlily,fut407,"Oh yeah. I finally realized I have several different curl types all over my head. Mostly 3c. But I also have 3b near my neck hairline, and some 3a at the top closer to my face."
raginglightskin,fut407,"Yes, I get these hairs too! I’ve been natural for over 4 years now and still get them, I have the same hair pattern as you too."
freshlyglossed,funyg2,"Scared of my natural hair and she might be scared of me too&&&Hey everyone, I’m new to this community but basically just wanted some advice. I guess I’ll start off by saying that I have short 4C hair. She’s dry, dry and very coarse. Anything i put in there, she sucks it up and dries right back out throughout the day. 

I’ve pretty much been natural since i was 10 or 11. But my mom never knew how to really take care of my hair other than just putting braids in. So I never really got experience doing anything my hair so in turn, i have no idea what to do with her half the time so I do the quick weave/glue-in route most of the time because it’s quick, easy and the one thing I’ve been able to finally master. I’ve been doing them essentially for the last 3 years off and on in between braids especially because I was away at school. But now years later, I’m losing the whole front of my head, my edges are there but thin and the front of my hair is maybe an inch long. 
My friend keeps urging me to stop doing glue-in’s and just “be free” but honestly I’m so scared to because I don’t feel as cute with my short fro as I do with my regular hair. My natural hair frustrates me to the point where after 2 hours of trying something I just give up and leave it as is. I try the braid outs but I have no clue how to French or Dutch braid, I tried little two strand twists but once I took them down it was just...not like the YouTube video. I still can’t think of where I go wrong every time. But now I’m just rambling lol.

I guess what I’m asking is trying to find styles that are easy to do that don’t make me feel like I need to breakdown and shave my head and also how can I be more confident with my natural hair when all I want to do when I wear it is hide???&&&I just follow the twist out videos honestly but they always come down either barely twisted or frizzy, even if I put oil on my fingertips. I guess I could twist them up decent and leave them up"
uppitynegresss,funyg2,Why take the twist out?
Qtitanium5,fuk0vt,"I don’t know what to do.&&&Before Reading, here are some things you should know:
- I have fine 4c hair (finer in the front than in the back)
- I am 100% natural, and have never relaxed nor texturized my hair.
- My hair is at like an awkward-ish length...The back reaches the middle of my neck and the front reaches below my nose. 
—————————————————————————
Hey all. This is going to be a long post, so please bear with me lol. I am currently a senior in high school, who will be going off to college (hopefully) in the next six months. During this time of social distancing and online learning, I have been trying to experiment with different hairstyles here and there, and have come to a realization: I’m incapable of maintaining my hair myself. I know it may seem like an over-exaggeration, but I just don’t have the ability to style my own hair. I don’t understand when I should moisturize my hair and when I shouldn’t. My mom (who is also a natural) really tries to teach me how to do my hair, but I always end up struggling tremendously. I understand how to wash my hair, but when it comes to anything besides that, it’s foreign to me. I try watching YouTube videos, with hopes of educating myself on what I can do, but still end up unable to effectively do it. I have talked to my mom about certain methods like the LOC and LCO methods, but she claims that she doesn’t really care too much for these methods, and would rather put oil and leave-in conditioner in whatever order she pleases. I know that if I were able to do my own hair, I’d be able to experiment with these methods on my own accord, but like I said...I can’t. I’ve frequently contemplated cutting my hair into a shorter style, but became anxious thinking about it, as I wasn’t sure whether the hairstyle would fit my face, or if my hair would ever be able to grow back to where it is right now, again...3 years ago, i experienced a great deal of shedding and breakage, but have overcome that drastically (thanks mom :)). Just two weeks ago I trimmed my ends, but they still keep breaking off (not excessively, just a bit), so length retention is always iffy. I do not want to relax or add any chemicals to my hair, as my scalp and skin are extremely sensitive. Wearing braids makes my hair fall out more than usual, so I’ve always avoided them. *sigh* I just don’t know what to do, nor how to go about this. My hair has probably been one of my biggest insecurities, mainly because it’s fine (fine, but I have medium density hair) When my mom does protective styles on my hair, they don’t come out the way i envision them. I want to learn to love my hair, but this state of limbo and confusion has made it harder for me. I know this was a lot to digest, and frankly it was very unstructured, but I hope someone understands where I’m coming from and can offer some words of advice. Thank you if you read this far, and please wash your hands and stay safe!&&&I appreciate your advice, thanks so much🙌🏽"
bettysbad,fuk0vt,"some fine 4b/c hair tips I've learned along the way:

I don't use detangling brushes, and only let a comb touch my hair after finger detangling, and just do it enough to remove shed hair. i don't expect my hair to be brushed into perfect little curls with conditioner.. fine hair will break off in the process and retangle immediately. 

steam helps my hair open up to moisture... it loves it. 

maybe blowdry your hair after your next wash day, (on low and cool), and put your hair into medium sized twists and spritz them everyday with a mixture of water and oil or watered down conditioner.

 you sound overwhelmed more than completely unable to care for your hair. this simple style may allow you to notice what your hair likes without having to deal with it in its loose state when a mistake can cause it to become super unmanageable, overwhelming, and more lrone to breakage.

after you're comfortable, you can do a twist out after a week of twists and you'll probably see how manageable your hair is after a week of being left alone and consistently moisturized and fed.

 also for the in between stage, bobby pins and twist outs are great for fine hair. just pin it how you want, no breakage. for more volume pull apart the twists more.

 fine hair has the advantage of staying stretched when well oiled, it's light enough to be weighed down. find a light oil to seal in water after washes or remoisturizing. castor oil can help heal your scalp and protect your hair shaft as well, but its very heavy so mix it with water or something light. 

learn to love exploring with your hair and figuring out how you like your hair to look. 

good luck! 
trim the scraggly ends of your twists every other wash day.
 don't over think it.
oh and look for a conditioner with a little protein in it"
uppitynegresss,fuk0vt,"The key is to keep it moisturized. If it starts to feel dry then dampen it, the LOC(with something natural) it and put a shower cap on under your bonnet/scarf."
