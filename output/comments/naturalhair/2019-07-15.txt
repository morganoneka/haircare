chrisissues,cg73kk,"Can yall ID my hair type and have advice on promoting growth? Im trying something new and growing it out, think its a 4c but thats about it.&&&"
PigmentedLady,cg4755,"Just had to comment bc you don't know how to bring up it without offending her. I just want to say you're a kind daughter, because although im my mothers best friend; Lady if you pull my hair Ima tell it how it is. ü§£ü§£"
colors32,cg4755,"My mom also always insist on helping me with my protective style, though she can crochet braid well she is really rough with my hair,I don't know how to bring this up without offending her&&&So today I did passion twist on my hair and in the front of my hair i did individuals and the back theres cornrows. I let my mom do the back and I did the front.  I had spring twist about 2 months ago and my mom wanted to redo it and we did the same method but I felt like she was extremely rough with the individuals so i did it myself.  I thought her cornrowing the back would be fine but tbh last time my hair was already moisturized and detangle. This time my mom was really RIPPING through my dry hair with a fine tooth comb and the whole time I was wincing but I was afraid to say something cause I didn't want tui offend her or anything.  Then after we finished crocheting the back my mom started saying how the front individuals was too loose. And while I know I'm not the best at crochet braids the front still looks pretty good i just didn't do it as tightly as she used to.  And then a few minutes later my mom goes ""you know im gonna redo the front right? "" and that kinda frustrated me I spent like 2 hours on it and it doesn't look bad. I just want a nice summer protective style but my mom keeps insisting on helping me and I feel like she's just attributing to more breakage."
meqek,cg4755,"I'd tell her that you're really tender-headed and ask her to be gentle.  That and make sure you've already, washed, detangled, moisturize and section before you guys start."
shermanedupree,cg4755,"This is one of my mom and I's biggest continuous fights.

She always attests my length was due to her help but I hadn't been living at home for a year üò≠üò≠

I actually lost inches after she last helped me take my braid out (I had just gotten my hair to waist length and am probably going to need to cut it to my shoulders now due to the damage)

I just tell her that she is too agressive and painful with my hair and won't let her touch it anymore. 

She's thinks that I am too sensitive with my hair and tender headed but I just let it be. 

I also practiced braiding now so I'm officially better than her just waaay slower lol"
sopreshous,cg4755,"Sit down with your ma and have a talk. 

‚Äú Hey Ma. I really enjoy the time we spend together on my hair and I appreciate you taking the time to do it. Recently I‚Äôve been concerned about breakage, so I like my style looser. ‚Äú

Add or take away what you need to.  You should also make sure your hair is prepped accordingly. Wash, detangle, and parted before your mother starts to help you. You can also explain that you‚Äôve been tendered headed and that tight styles are giving you headaches if you wanna fib."
HeyItsKimberlee,cfw69t,Have you tried buying off of iHerb.com? When I was in Korea I was able to shop hair care on there and it shipped pretty quick.
MangoFruitHead,cfw69t,You can find a lot of products for Afro hair on Coupang.
kieramichaela,cfw69t,Anyone here from South Korea? If so can anyone give suggestions on places to get hair products for Afro textures hair near Korea University?&&&&&&Thank you!!!!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you!!!
thatsaprettyname,cfw69t,There‚Äôs a Facebook group called Natural Beauty in Korea. There‚Äôs irokcurls.com and honey hair that I‚Äôve heard of.
Ellacute6040,cfocf3,Make sure you detangle your hair from the root before twisting/cornrowing. Afro pick is really good for detangling natural hair from the root.
Zaylyn5355,cfocf3,I stretch my hair for that very reason before I braid or twist
colors32,cfocf3,Does anybody struggle with hair tangling when trying to cornrow/ flat twist?&&&I seem to have this problem all the time I detangle my hair beforehand and when I try to flat twist/ braid it or even section it it's a struggle.  Its so hard to do certain protective styles I try to do flat twist styles and I run into this issue a lot. I flat twist today and its real ugly cause I was having trouble with the sections lol.
cruwnn,cfocf3,"Same here, detangling is only half the battle. Trying to braid or twist with strands of hair tangling is such a hassle."
mani_mani,cfocf3,I find that I struggle more when I‚Äôm in need of a trim.
twixe,cfocf3,Yes! Half the time I give up.
butterflyintherough,cfo35g,And I oop- even though I could never do this lol&&&
Blumeblume,cfmjl2,"When you say you top the botanical-based gel ‚Äúwith something that will hold your curls for several days‚Äù, what kind of product are you referring to? Another gel, a curl cream/activator? 

I‚Äôm asking bc I use Camille Rose Naturals Curl Maker but don‚Äôt put anything on top of it and I‚Äôm wondering if my wash n go would last longer if I put something on top.

Thank you so much for sharing!"
CoffeeB4Talkie,cfmjl2,"I add leave in right after I rinse out the deep conditioner. I keep a spray bottle with hot water near and spray each section as I go along as it tends to start air drying. 

I also warm my conditioners up a bit before applying."
DaniMrynn,cfmjl2,"Mostly type 4 low porosity here; I do mainly wash n gos. After I wash out whichever conditioner I'm using that day I go straight to either a leave in or botanical-based gel on soaking wet hair, then top it with something that will hold my curls for several days. If I need to I'll co-wash and re-do the gel before wash day, but I don't mind some loss of definition - gives more body to my hair. 

If I do a twist out, I'll let some of the water evaporate from my hair before I add a leave in and twist with a good twist cream. I can easily stay moisturised for a week until wash day comes around again."
TooBold,cfmjl2,"I‚Äôm a 3c/4a mix. It‚Äôs super thick and long, reaches the top of my butt when I stretch it but MBL ish when it‚Äôs curly. I only do wash n goes because my hair takes toooooo long to dry if I braid it. Twist outs are always damp. So. 

I have a curly girl routine (no silicones or sulfates). When I rinse out the conditioner I put leave in in in ‚ò∫Ô∏è sections while I‚Äôm in the shower. I‚Äôve been using the Cantu curl activator, which is very nice. Smells awesome. Then I get out. Add Camille Rose curl maker in sections (8 total), but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary actually. After I put the curl maker on a section, I immediately follow up with gel.  I was only using uncle funky‚Äôs daughter and kinky curly for YEARS. But recently I went back to Eco Aegean and it‚Äôs been working beautifully for way less. 

For me gel is the best sealant. It‚Äôs gives me hold and actually locks the moisture in. 

Maybe see if you can do a wash n go?"
VioletValkyrie,cfmjl2,"I have low porosity, high density 3C/4A-B hair that is around 20"" long.
After I apply my DC I sit under my hooded dryer for about 25-30 minutes. I rinse it out and before leaving the shower I apply my leave-in conditioner. You never wanna leave the shower with no product in your hair. Low-po hair needs all the help it can get to retain moisture.

After I get out of the shower I grab my spray bottle. Heated water makes it easier for your hair to absorb the moisture and drink up the product so I have the kettle going during my shower, so that I can use the hottest water I can.

I spray my hair with a healthy amount of heated water and layer on my moisturizer and gel, using the praying hands method and a detangling brush if the fingers aren't cutting it. I no longer need my Denman brush, my curls hage been clumping sooo nicely. I've been shingling every wash day lately.

After the shower I sit under my hooded dryer for 45-75 minutes and I'm all done! I don't refresh in between wash days."
at1withme,cfmjl2,I put on a plastic cap and sit under the dryer for a few minutes to let things heat up and let my products penetrate my lo-po strands..
batty_luvs,cfmjl2,I either apply an oil right after I finish rinsing out my conditioner in the shower or I apply my leave in. But most of the time I apply my oil mix on soaking wet hair then I wrap my hair in a tshirt and then style
colors32,cfmjl2,"People with low porosity hair what is your wash day routine after deep conditioning?&&&So I have 4b/4c low porosity hair.  On wash days I feel like I have a lot of moisture after using a rinse out conditioner and deep conditioning, but I'm a little confused on what to do after washing my deep conditioner out. I see a lot of advice on youtube about moisturizing on damp low porosity hair, so I let mt hair air dry for like an hour or two then apply the lco method on my hair with camile rose moisture milk or honey hydrate , curls blueberry bliss then sweet almond oil.  But I feel like it's a hit or miss on whether the products penetrate my hair. I feel like the products aren't the issue I just feel like sometimes my hair doesn't penetrate the products and sometimes it does and I'm just trying to figure out a better method to moisturize my hair so that my products can penetrate into my hair better."
depranxiousenergy,cfmjl2,How do you warm them?
heavwhit,cfmjl2,"i‚Äôll leave my hair in twists from washing  and let it dry in a cotton t-shirt. then after a couple hours i‚Äôll style it with water or aloe vera juice, whipped shea butter and flaxseed gel. that‚Äôs it."
huemon_siin,cfmjl2,Let you hair dry in the bun after you apply leave in conditioner! Completely dry! It feels like you hair has super absorbed moisture this has seriously doubled my length
leeleep93,cfmjl2,"I have 4a/4b lo-Po and I usually put on my leave in right after I wash out the deep conditioner. Then I put on a shower cap until I apply my other products. 

Only thing is that my go to style is a wash and go so my next product is usually just gel"
namasteplantbased,cfmjl2,"I have low porosity hair and don't really use shampoo. I use clays like bentonite to clean my hair.¬†Bentonite clay can detox low porosity hair and scalp, remove excess product build-up, and [make low porosity hair more receptive to hair care products and treatments](https://www.healthyhuemans.com/healthy-beauty/2019/4/24/3-ways-to-use-bentonite-clay-for-low-porosity-hair). It's helped my hair hold moisture much more after washing. So a standard leave in works after using."
scafemiester,cfmjl2,i use aztec clay or ACV to wash my hair.. i dont use shampoo. when i rinse my DC out i apply my leave in while still in the shower and let it air dry a little before i style.
spicegrl1,cfmjl2,"Have u removed all protein containing products from your regimen? Have checked whether hard water could b an issue? I use a hard water shampoo, zero protein products & sit under a heated dryer for 10 mins to let my hair oil penetrate."
subnado,cfmjl2,Thanks for sharing! Never thought about using bentonite clay for my hair. Definitely going to give it a try.
vengefulhart,cfmjl2,"I'm in the process of transitioning my hair and my texturised ends seem to be low porosity. I've been experimenting lately and doing twist outs, after I co-wash/ shampoo and deep condition I'll apply a light oil, leave in conditioner and cream/ gel in sections and then I'll twist my hair. If it starts to dry out while I'm doing all this I'll spritz it with a bit of distilled water. Once I've done the twists and it's still damp I then seal them with a bit of diy butter (Shea butter, avocado oil, almond oil and flaxseed oil). When I untwist my hair the next day after it's air dried my curls are nice, soft and defined and my twist out will last about 5 days. By day 3 my hair might need a bit of moisture so I'll either spritz with a bit of water and then seal with a light oil/ diy butter or I'll use a diy curl refresher. I've found this works best for me as I'm currently dealing with two different textures, so I'd say experiment a bit to find out what will work best for you and your hair."
boopalooo,cfl5ep,"I think the big difference is the type of hair you use? Passion twists I know use this water wave synthetic hair, I think Spring-twists use this hair that‚Äôs more cooled that gives you the bouncy springy look and I think they‚Äôre usually worn a bit shorter.

1. I‚Äôm not sure I know I‚Äôve seen the rubber band method used with Passion twists but not with spring twists, I‚Äôm sure you can YouTube it though! 

2. I have really thick hair, I don‚Äôt wash my hair during protective styles and just accept the fact I‚Äôll
Only wear it for 2-3 weeks. There was a little while I tried, like just focus on my scalp but if just gets so frizzy and starts to look really bad to me, so I don‚Äôt wash it. 

3. Not sure what hair to use for Spring Twists, but the go to with Passion Twists is Freetress Waterwave crochet hair!"
sports39,cfl5ep,What‚Äôs the difference between spring twists and passion twists?&&&Im transitioning and i‚Äôve been looking up some protective styles to do and i have a few questions. 1) can i do the rubber band method w both? 2) i‚Äôm pretty active so how do i wash when i have the twists in? 3) any recs on hair?
vinitac888,cfjee2,Which home remedies is best for hair loss?&&&[removed]
CoffeeB4Talkie,cfifvr,No. But I have more naturally dry scalp/skin.
Marvelnegress23,cfifvr,"Oily skin?&&&Has anyone else noticed after they went natural, their skin got super oily? Maybe its the oil,  or the products I use"
Salt-Light-Love,cfifvr,"You're not alone. I'm trying to find a balance because the acne is bothering me. This week my skin is clear, but it's also in protective styles and I've put much less oil in it. ü§∑üèæ"
UnderSomeRock,cfifvr,A cotton t-shirt over the pillow works well too! Especially if you're like me and have a billion of them lol
empathalogist,cfifvr,"Sometimes you have to change your pillowcases more often, one night on one side, one night on the other and then switch it out for a fresh case.

It's a bit of selfcare as well, having that fresh sheet smell every night. :)"
LoveIsDestinee,cffnlf,"Figuring out the right products for me&&&How do I find the right products or at least the right direction avoiding the buying expensive ass products and doing trial and error. 

I want to know at least the direction to go in. 

I‚Äôve taken a look at the hair charts but the confuse the hell out of me. 

I‚Äôm taking my hair out of braids soon and I‚Äôm so nervous about my upcoming natural styles bc I want my hair to be pretty with my curls popping 

I usually go in the store when it‚Äôs time to do my hair and blindly shop and that has been soso&&&I just watched some videos and matched my pattern I would say that I have 4B hair. I used Cantu but I seen women complaining about it having alcohol in it even though it didn‚Äôt cause me any problems I was thinking it may have been doing damage I didn‚Äôt know about"
UnderSomeRock,cffnlf,"What's your hair like? 

In general, Shea Moisture and Cantu are both pretty widely used for natural hair and are a good starting point. They also aren't tooooo expensive and they go on sale pretty frequently at Sally's"

Commiecurls,cf7gjc,Favorite Wash and Go Products?&&&[removed]
Commiecurls,cf76qt,"Maintaining Straight Natural Hair?&&&Maintaining length especially. I know some do it and I actually grew my hair out of a relaxer while pressing every two weeks but that was years ago. Haven't straightened my hair in years. My length has also been stagnant, so I'm aware that I need to trim more and I've been trying to be more attentive to my hair. 

But as much as I love my curls, I've been wanting to play around with a new look. Not cutting, im resisting coloring for now, and definitely not relaxing. But pressing my hair once every 1-3 weeks and then maybe keeping it curly for week 4. With heat protectant, trims, and hair care, I might even maintain more length (less detangling, I usually do wash n gos over protective styling)

Im thinking of starting with a blowout/wand curl routine.

Thoughts? Experiences maintaining straight natural hair?

My hair type is in the 4s. Probably mostly 4a with some other jams mixed in."
jaejaeok,cf76qt,"This is something I would like to explore but have been too scared since my hair texture is very fine and I always always always get heat damage after one press. I think you have to be very honest about what your hair can withstand. It could be easier to maintain straight but if your hair isn‚Äôt up for it, you‚Äôll want to know that before you make the decision. If it is however up for it, it‚Äôs worth a low heat trial and see how you do for two weeks. Did you give it more routine attention or less? Real questions like that."
CoffeeB4Talkie,cf02xr,It's the only detangling tool that my daughter actually likes. I spray our hair with a water bottle that I fill with hot water. Then add a detangler or conditioner (Kinky Curly Knot Today is a great detangler. I use either that or one of my conditioners from The Mane Choice).
Ini_O,cf02xr,"4c hair and Tangle Teezer? Good experiences or nah?&&&Hey! First time posting on Reddit but it seems to be a great information source for questions such as these.  


There are so many mixed reviews on hair forums and websites but I'd like to hear from people's first hand experience... has anyone with 4c hair used a tangle teezer (or any tangle teezer-esque brush) for detangling their 4c kinky hair consistently with good results? 


By good results I mean, easy quicker detangling, with no increase in hair breakage, ends splitting or mid shaft splits?? 


And, if Yes, would you mind posting your detangling regimen and how/when you use the tangle teezer? 


Thanks in advance y'all."
JadaNJade,cf02xr,"Not 4c so I won't get into my regimen unless you want to. I'm 3c so I guess as far as shape goes the only difference between our hair is the shape of the crossections of our hair strands. Yours is more oval than mine, and thus, your hqir is curlier. 

Nevertheless I LOVE my tangle teaser. It's better than my Denman brush. 
- Less breakage
- More shed hairs
- Bristles flex much more/doesn't force itself through knots and tangles
- Quicker detangling
- Easier cleaning

I mix water and conditioner and spritz my hair so it's damp but not saturated. Then I detangle and plait in sections. From there I go in the shower to poo and recondition or I let my hair dry and do a braid out look. 

I love my tangle teaser."
Prinesspeach2927,cf02xr,Dont do it! It destroyed my hair i had to cut off 3 inches which devastated me because i worked so hard to take care of my hair and grow it just to have it all break off.
Subparwoman,cf02xr,Try the Tangle Tamer from Sally Beauty (I use the Deluxe version shaped more like a brush but the teardrop one is what I first used from my mother). The bristles are thicker and didn't pull at my hair the way the Tangle Teezer seemed to.&&&Sort of. I use the Tangle Tamer Deluxe from Sally Beauty. It's similar to the Tangle Teezer which I have also tried but I found that the Tangle Teezer bristles are too thin/prickle-y for my hair (Also got that from Sally Beauty but returned it). The one from Sally Beauty has thicker bristles and honestly it's my favorite thing to detangle my hair with!
TTtotallydude23,cf02xr,4c hair here and it‚Äôs literally the only thing I use besides my hands . Use it wet of course but it‚Äôll work dry to an extent too. There nothing better
UnderSomeRock,cf02xr,"You should always start from the ends when detangling with any style tool!&&&3c/4a here and I LOVE the tangle teaser. (But I hated it when I first got it). The trick is to work in small sections. I so use a wide tooth comb first, but that step is optional"
Zaylyn5355,cf02xr,I use a knock off Felicia leather wood I bought on so Amazon. I love it. It's my go to brush!
blackpino,cf02xr,">Tangle Tamer

Same, I had shredded strands all the way to the root!  It detangled my hair amazingly but I basically wrecked my hair so now I'm bleaching it and coloring it since I will have to cut to the root soon.  I use one of those hard shower brushes that has separating rows and its decent.  I want to try one with a bit more bristles tho."
npbm2008,cf02xr,"You have to start at the ends and work up!

Starting at the roots to detangle is never a good idea with 4C hair."
soapdishhh,cf02xr,"Honestly shocked by all the positive feedback. I got one, tried to use it, failed miserably, and returned it. When I started at the ends on wet hair it just didn‚Äôt seem to detangle. I also got the one without the handle and that was really awkward to use.  Maybe I was doing it wrong."
teaup_,cf02xr,"I use something similar its called crave naturals (got it on amazon), i do have 4a/b hair but it works amazing on wet and dry hair."
xidebo,cf02xr,"4b/c and just got the tangle teezer - I like it a lot, but I only use it for wet detangling. I section and finger detangle while my hair is dry. I also keep my hair sectioned when I hop in the shower to wash, and there's barely any resistance when I use the teezer on one section of wet hair (basically 1/8th of my head) at a time.   

Used to use the denman (with all the bristles inserted) and then a post on this subreddit suggested otherwise and I've noticed significantly less shedding since I made the change."
Gloomyglomp,cetc4l,"I have a similar hair type to yours. Wet hair feels so gross to me, and my sis got me a diffuser which changed my wash and go game frfr. I dont get as much frizz as when i air dry and also dont have to deal with wet or sticky hair all day!"
because_pineapples,cetc4l,My hair is like yours and I've never really been able to get the hang of using a diffuser. I usually sit under my hooded dryer if I don't want to air dry my wash and go.
eal90692,cetc4l,Diffusing Hair&&&So I am thinking about purchasing a blow dryer that has a diffuser attachment. Do any of you ladies diffuse your hair when you do a wash n go? Do you get better results? I have 3c/4a low porosity hair.&&&Yes the sticky hair drives me nuts!
missb3,cetc4l,"I'm 3b/3c and diffusing has been a game-changer for me! I love my results and now I don't have to sit at home all day on wash days waiting for my hair to dry lol. I usually let it air dry anywhere from 30 mins to an hour and 30 mins before diffusing, depending on how much time I have. I got a silicone diffuser attachment from Sally Beauty for $10 and I love it because it's collapsible."
noelle29,cetc4l,"I feel I get better results with a diffuser. I apply my products, bun my hair in sections to let the product soak in and then diffuse. I start by diffusing at the roots with my head straight up, the airflow as down-angled as possible while still facing my scalp. Then I flip my head upside down to finish my roots and dry the ends a little, also with airflow angled down. I never face the dryer against the grain of my hair (if that makes sense lol), it makes my hair frizzy and encourages shrinkage."
Chunswae22,cer6gn,"Dreadlocks, shaved sides or fully shaved?&&&Hello, I have previously made a post about how I'm struggling to look after my 4c because of health issues.

RandomWeirdShit,cer6gn,"While not as strenuous as loose hair locs still require quite a bit of upkeep. Retwisting, keeping them moisturized, and keeping buildup from happening are the primary points of upkeep.

I wash my hair myself once a month and go to the salon for a wash, retwist, and sometimes a style once a month. So in all, I wash my hair every other week. I get a deep clean and condition every other month (or 3 months)."
