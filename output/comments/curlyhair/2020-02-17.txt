dana19671969,f8lyqi,"Your hair is fabulously sexy! 

My hair (on a good day) is as curly as yours...any suggestions on leave in conditioners that are the bomb!

Love your look.

Edited to say .... upon second look my hair is a lil less curly than yours. On a good day I’m probably as curly as you on a really bad day. My curls form more at the ends of my hair, not so much at the scalp.

Whatever you’re doing keep it up 👍"
davelabyrinth,f8lyqi,"You’re killin it, boo!!!"
llama_in_a_bathtub,f8lyqi,"Me: .... my hair: *floofs under any condition*&&&&&&I usually use the miss Jessie’s pillow soft curl gel :) it does help! Sometimes no matter what I do though, if the weather is changing, my hair decides it’s going to be a mane lol.&&&Thanks beyotch ✌️💕&&&Enjoy this bathroom photo with the nice toilet cameo 🤧✌️my routine has changed a bit since the whole dc thing has been going on. I just personally haven’t had any serious issues other than some scalp build up & slight hair thinning but I decided to cut dc out while this whole thing is going on. My current routine has been: wash with Wild Kindness shampoo from Rocky Mountain soap company, condition with the conditioner from the same line, and detangle while it’s in my hair. It’s a pretty thin formula tbh and I’m not that into it but I’m testing it out before I make a final decision. When I get out, I use a tangle teezer and shea moisture hibiscus and coconut curly hair smoothie. I may have to finger coil or smth depending on how frizzy my hair is, but honestly it just does it’s own thing and I’m living with it 🤷🏻‍♀️ I almost always diffuse during the winter since it’s so cold."
tellmeyoulovemeee,f8lyqi,Love your hair! Maybe hair gel will help with the floofs
filibear14,f8lnez,"The hair gods blessed me just in time for a wedding&&&&&&Thank you!&&&Routine:
Soak hair and shampoo with whatever the heck I have lying around (no more than once a week).
Apply Whole Blends Avocado conditioner time midsection and detangle with fingers and a wide tooth comb, followed by fine tooth.
Rinse with cold water and scrunch until almost squeaky.
Apply a leave in conditioner to midsection and scrunch in.
Plop or sleep in a pineapple. I only air dry cause I’m lazy af.
Once dry tease roots and break any crunchy curls.
Voila! Hope for the best."

isabelfan,f8l635,"CGM beginner. also new to reddit. just starting, my hair looks a lot curlier than usual! but how will it dry?&&&&&&omg thank you for your tips/suggestions. i do not have a diffuser yet, please let me know if you have a fav. 😊"
nonsense_hustler,f8l635,"Beautiful curls! The way to keep the shape nice and frizz free is to touch it as little as possible while it's drying. I'm serious. Put in your styling products, whatever combing or scrunching finger coiling you do, and then do not touch it until it is dry. 

You can let it air dry but I find using a diffuser with medium heat, high speed gives me the best results. You can use low/no heat, but it does take forever and in this technique the heat is very gentle. I learned this from manesbymell on YouTube, game changer. 

Do not put the diffuser directly on your curls. Starting with the roots hold it a bit off the hair so you're just hovering. When you feel like the roots are starting to get dry move lower down toward the middle of the strand. Once you start getting dry on the top of your head you can start to gently move your head around. Upside down, side to side, you want access to all parts of your hair. Do not touch your hair with your hands or the dryer just let gravity do the work.

Just roots, middle, ends and once you're totally dry scrunch. Hair that feels cold while you're drying it is wet.

I hope this helped I know it's a novel!"

Fyriia,f8l4c1,"I think it's so funny how Shea Moisture used to be so unpopular on this sub when I started the CGM a bit more than a year ago - lots of people saying that oils dont belong in hair products as ""oil and water dont mix!"" and dry hair needs moisture (=water).


I even came across multiple people saying Shea Moisture products made their hair fall out in clumps. and now they're having such a comeback and the oils are suddenly fine."
PrincessShade,f8l4c1,Why is devacurl cancelled now?
curious_kramer,f8l4c1,Deva curl is the only thing that works for me. I have tried a lot of things. Things I thought worked gave me acne after two or 3 days.
esthela812,f8l4c1,"When I tried Shea moisture it didn’t work for me, but I also am now more informed than ever about my hair porosity and what it likes and what it doesn’t. So I’m hoping to give the line a try again (the low porosity line)! Devacurl worked great for me when nothing else would, but I have noticed my hair falling out more than usual (like I can see my scalp now) so wish me luck !! I’ve been in between products at this moment and my hair is sucking but this group has helped me learn a lot in these two days!!! I’m excited to go shopping today and start fresh"
longlongclimb,f8l4c1,"I just used Shea Moisture Manuka Honey condish for the first time today! I had to start my CGM routine all over again because of stupid DevaCurl. My hair had been looking like ass for months and I couldn't figure out why. 

I'm co-washing with Tresemme Botanique, using the Shea Moisture condish, then Not Your Mother's Gel (so thankful I know about ""scrunch out the crunch"" and ""squish to condish""!). I did a reset wash this weekend. My hair already looks better! But I think I have a ways to go to restore it to its former glory. It thinned out a bit. le sigh."

twixe,f8l4c1,"I like SM products, but I was a bit surprised to see everyone jump to them as a replacement. Up until recently, a lot of people in this sub found it too heavy for their hair.&&&Some people are having reactions/hair falling out. No one knows for sure what's causing it."
binaisaa,f8kyhq,"Alaffia Products with FINE, 3A CURLS&&&Thinking about buying Alaffia conditioner (and maybe shampoo).

Has anyone with **FINE** curly hair used the Everyday Shea and/or Everyday Coconut conditioners? I'm afraid they might be too thick and weigh down my curls.

I might pair it with SheaMoisture Mango & Carrot Kids shampoo... really looking for light-weight products here lol."

I know, I'm just curious to know my hair type.&&&My hair is natural. With that said, I have a huge problem with porous hair, which is now somewhat controlled when I use half lemon on my conditioner or treatment cream. Today I'm on day after, so I'll treat it tomorrow. I mostly wash my hair with cowash, I'm using a local brand called Skala, I'm finishing my ""Desmaiado"", here's the ingredients on the botton left:

For Conditioner I use also a local brand called Salon Line, which is this one ""Maria Natureza festival das flores"" (Something like Nature Mary flower festival), ingredients are on the botton.

momofrose,f8jyo8,"This is probably the best my hair’s been since starting CGM. How would you preserve it overnight and revive it in the morning (in less than 15 minutes)?&&&&&&I did a full wash four days ago, so I only cowashed it today.

Today’s routine: cowash with TRESemmé Botanique Nourish conditioner, STC with the same, brush it through with my Pattern brush, then rinse about 75% out.

Rake in Garnier Fructis curl sculpt cream gel, brush it through with my Pattern brush, scrunch for definition, plop for 15, diffuse on high/high for 35, then SOTC with vitamin E on my hands.


I have a silk pillowcase and a satin nightcap, and I only typically takes 15 minutes maximum to do my hair in the morning, as I work at 5:30 AM and cannot diffuse without waking up the rest of the household.

What techniques and/or products would you use to keep the curl for day two?"
seeteekay,f8jyo8,I just want to say your hair looks fabulous. I am still trying to figure out second day refresh as well. I have watched lots of youtube videos. So you might start there.
Q782j352,f8jx12,I use an awesome frizz free mousse from shea moisture. It doesnt crunch your curls. Really just helps them set without the frizz.
bpem87,f8jx12,"I would try applying gel to soaking wet hair with praying hands. And drying your hair with a t-shirt, gently scrunching out excess water."
roseyposeyzoe,f8jx12,"please help y’all, my hair is so frizzy and undefined and i have no idea what to use on it or do to it&&&&&&the bottom layer is super defined and curly but the top layer is frizzy and wavy and uneven so i usually end up wearing it half up half down but i would love to be able to wear it all down. i also just have so much hair that it’s hard.

I wash my hair twice a week with ethique frizz wrangler and i condition every day with beauty and planet divine definition. i wrap my hair in a towel without necessarily drying it and then I spray frizz ease dream curls and squish it with my hands and then let it air dry"
