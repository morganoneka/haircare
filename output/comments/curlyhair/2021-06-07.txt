Jew_Unit,nzdvkw,"Hello, I'm a guy with a similar hair type and porosity, and in a month or so, I could tell you how it turns out with my new routine. Waiting on products right now, though I still don't have a good leave in. Have you found a good one?"
KafkaesqueLife,nzdvkw,"Product Reqs for thick high porosity hair?&&&My boyfriend is jumping on the CGM train and we're trying to figure out what products work for him. He has thick, high porosity hair that's very dry and frizzy. We live in a high humidity area and he has sensitive skin and a dry scalp. Type 3b/3c hair is my best guess. 

We're still in the process of figuring out products and an order/routine for him, so any recommendations or tips would be much appreciated! Just got a denman brush + a few new cowashes/conditioners/leave ins/gel/hair masks to experiment with.&&&He's been using the Cantu leave in conditioner for now, and hasn't had complaints.

FerociousFrizzlyBear,nzdonw,"Just cut my hair from waist to jaw and this is waaaay less of a concern than it used to be.&&&I think ‚Äúwash‚Äù is often used as a catchall to refer to soaking your hair in the shower vs. just reviving some frizz or squished curls in your dry hair in other days. It doesn‚Äôt differentiate between the actual products used in the shower. When wash really means wash, sometimes the difference is that you have to layer in some oils or heavier products."

Japatts,nzdonw,"This quickly became my life after starting cgm‚Ä¶&&&&&&I had to go back into the office for two weeks in a row‚Ä¶I decided it was best to wake up 4 hours before work and recondition between washes to get my hair to *nearly* cooperate. Not ideal but I once forgot I hadn‚Äôt touched it all day, jumped on a teams call, and got audibly laughed at. Luckily it was just my boss and not any of my clients.&&&For me it‚Äôs a roll of the dice‚Ä¶wash day looks decent. Day 2 or 3 *might* look better if my hair feels like it I guess. Otherwise I get greasy and wispy, or frizzy and poofy.&&&I‚Äôm honestly thinking about it‚Ä¶but then I get a great curl day like once a week and am reinvigorated by my curls.&&&YIKES. I thought my last place was a frankenhouse‚Ä¶built in like 1900 (which I‚Äôm finding is fairly new in the Boston area) and had a stove hood over the washing machine in the basement. I‚Äôm told it was because most houses didn‚Äôt have a/c so they put a stove in the basement for baking during the summer. Being from the Midwest, that did not compute with me. Luckily back then I hadn‚Äôt embraced my curls yet and my hair was short bc no a/c in the summer is pretty much a guarantee that my hair would never dry. It would just transition from shower damp to sweaty damp.&&&I wish I could get away with that‚Ä¶&&&Mine hasn‚Äôt even reached my shoulders wet yet‚Ä¶ üò∞"
Livlaughthug,nzdonw,My day 3 curls are the best so all outings correspond with day 3.
MavisEnderby,nzdonw,"See, I have curly hair and I‚Äôve never really understood this whole ‚Äúwash day‚Äù thing because the only way for me to get my hair to do what I want is to take a shower. 

I don‚Äôt technically ‚Äúwash‚Äù it because I haven‚Äôt actually used shampoo for, like‚Ä¶ six years? But I either thoroughly wet it or use conditioner on it, and then I brush and style it while it‚Äôs wet and let it air-dry. In the summer, I dunk my head in the shower a couple/few times a day to get it sopping wet again. 

So I don‚Äôt get what people mean when they talk about wash days and how long it takes, and how they have to schedule it in! It takes me a few minutes in the shower and then another few minutes to brush it and that‚Äôs it."

PinkNGreenFluoride,nzdonw,"As an air-dryer, I feel this.  So much.    


I live in a 120 year old Frankenouse with decades of DIY alterations and additions, where I don't plug anything in in the bathroom.  When we moved in, the bathroom had a single, wreathed-out, slightly singed socket *in the ceiling*.  In our poorly ventilated bathroom.  What a horror show.  When we had a kitchen outlet fail and need replaced, I made a point to show it to the electrician.  Yeah, he was happy to remove that.  Air drying takes like 8 hours (and that's without using a gel), but in order to diffuse in this house I'd pretty much have to install a mirror in the kitchen, which seems silly."

Soockamasook,nzdobt,I also want to know. Except that my hair are more straight than I am
abi533,nzdobt,any product recommendations for my hair? it always gets frizzy and tangles up so much especially after i sleep&&&&&&my routine is using this shea moisture hydrate # repair mask before washing. I then rinse that and use function of beauty shampoo and conditioner for wavy hair.
KindFuzzybee,nzdmyz,"Im so confused with my hair please help. Low porosity but better looking results with protein & Moisture making my hair frizzier?! (Check comments)&&&&&&Okay sorry this is going to be long. 
My hair is low perosity, wavy with a few curls. I've been working on my natural hair for a year now as before that i used to just brush it out everyday/twice a day. 

The firts picture is my hair on mostly moisturizing products. This is after a really good wash day. My hair is somehow frizzy but felt soft and healthy. 
Routine: - shea moisture wavy hair shampoo
- garnier mask (either moisture or nurishing)
- shea moisture moisture wavy hair conditioner (moisturizing)
- curl activation cream by shea moisture
Then i style with a curly gel with lots of water, denman brush and diffuse. 

I wasnt happy with my hair as it was very frizzy, it would loose its curls on the second day and the ends were very stringy. 

The second picture is my hair on protein products. I decided to try them out even with low porosity hair just to see what it gave but still encluded moisture products.
Routine:
- same shampoo (moisture)
- imbue curl restoring protein hair mask
- mix of shea moisture moisturzing wave conditons and shea moisture curly hair protein conditioner (ration 3/1)
- same styling & curl cream


I noticed my hair is a lot less frizzy and the curls actually last until my next wash day ( i even mamaged a whole week with them). However, my hair breaks super easily. I noticed when taking out silk scrunchies A LOT of hair comes out compared to normal. 

And now im just confused. I checked my hair porosity again today and its still low. Which explains the breakage but why do i get better results. I dont know what to do. I want my hair to look how it does in the second picture but hate how much its breaking. Any recommendations?"
SerialKnitter2222,nzdmyz,"Listen to your hair ‚ò∫Ô∏è If your hair responds to protein, then give it some protein.  Low porosity hair still needs protein.  Aphogee is great like the previous poster said.

Just an FYI your hair will feel like straw until you condition it.  Don‚Äôt freak out (I freaked out üòÇ)

I always follow a protein treatment with a deep moisturizing treatment to balance it out. YMMV"
SoAnon4thisslp,nzdmyz,"Hi‚Äîyour wash routine looks like you are using a lot of heavy oils and butters, in my opinion, more suited to tight dry curls  than on your relatively fine hair with a lovely loose curl/ wave pattern.

These can build up and can cause ‚Äú frizz‚Äù.

I have a similar texture. 

I wash and condition OR use a hair mask, not both.

Any curl cream I use ( infrequently) doesn‚Äôt have very much, if any, oil or butters.

I‚Äôm a 2 gel gal: I use theOuidad advanced climate control ‚Äòhard hold‚Äù it‚Äôs a liquid, it has great slip, and the ingredients make it a double-duty heat protectant and anti frizz. It‚Äôs really more of a medium to soft hold; I layer a true hard hold gel on top of that.

That hard-hold might not work for your hair length.

You might want to hold off on the Denman styling to reduce breakage. That‚Äôs a lot of mechanical stress on your hair, especially given how long it is.

If you want a real protein treatment, I use the Aphogee 2 -step.  The other protein masks can‚Äôt compare. 

You may not need protein; in your shoes I would clarify and then use much lighter products‚Äî moisturizers without lots of butter/oil, curI creams that use protein or polymers instead of oils as the ingredients that activate curls.

I have found that most of us with loose curls/waves just can‚Äôt get good results with routines and products that are great for tight curls. Those routines don‚Äôt give us tight healthy curls‚Äî for me, I ended up with a heavy, frizzy mess."
WeAreStarless,nzdmyz,">Low porosity but better looking results with protein

it seems you're under the impression that high porosity means your hair loves protein, and low porosity means your hair hates protein. that is not the case! it's a common, persistent myth, but porosity and protein are completely unrelated and exist independently of one another"
ScarilyCheerful,nzdgq6,I had really good luck with the Miss Jessie's Multicultural Curls cream.
concerneddogmom,nzdgq6,"if you could recommend only ONE styling product for 2C/3A low porosity hair, what would it be?&&&my shower and skin care routine is already long enough, and it‚Äôs too hot where I live to fuss around with my hair, so I‚Äôd love a quick and minimal routine. I‚Äôve accepted my frizz and have actually come to like the look, but I‚Äôd like to embrace my volume and enhance my definition. outside of shampoo and conditioner, I‚Äôd really only like to use one styling product. what do you recommend?

- location: southern California
- curl type: 2C if I shower in the day and air dry, 3A if I shower at night and plop with a satin bonnet while I sleep or if I use cream and/or gel. also 2C in the under layers, 3A closer to the top of my head
- porosity: most likely low, but not 100% sure. water forms droplets on my hair, takes a long time to dry, and oil seems to just sit on top of my strands
- length: below my shoulder blades, close to mid-back
- oily/dry spectrum: mostly dry, roots are frizzy and don‚Äôt get oily quickly and lengths are dry 
- coarseness: medium
- density: medium but it feels like a lot
- wash day frequency: every 2-4 days, depending on if I was sweaty
- other: no dye or textural treatments
- preferred styling: no heat stylers, ideally no diffuser if I can help it (it‚Äôs just too hot where I live!), and only one styling product - I want it to take less than 15mins outside of the shower, not including dry time
- what I‚Äôve tried: As I Am cowash did the job but didn‚Äôt give me much definition. used devacurl and liked the definition, but stopped after all the controversy. I really liked the briogeo curl charisma line and used the shampoo, conditioner, gel, AND cream before knowing that protein overload was a thing, whoops! now I‚Äôm using custom shampoo + conditioner from Prose (sulfate free, not silicone free) and am still working on a formula that I like. I also clarify every other week with ACV.

edited to add that I also completely understand that a minimal routine won‚Äôt necessarily provide perfect results. my expectations are sufficiently managed, don‚Äôt worry!"

_uni_corn__,nzc0ao,"I have no idea what happened to my hair&&&Hello everyone! 

This is my first post so if I‚Äôm missing something or did something wrong please let me know.

Recently my hair has been shrinking an excessive amount. I know shrinkage is considered good however in my case I don‚Äôt think so. In fact I believe my shrinkage might be due to my hair being unusually dry and frizzy. I can add pictures if need be but for reference all through 2020 my hair when dried and ‚Äústyled‚Äù was roughly shoulder length maybe slightly longer. Now after my hair has been dried and styled within an hour my hair shrinks to about chin length. 

In addition to the shrinkage, my hair gets very dry and frizzy the next day. I‚Äôve always only washed my hair once a week and it‚Äôs rare for me to wash it more than once in a week. Last year my hair could last about 4-5 days before I had to put it up. Now I barely get a day before I have to put it up. 

While the wiki is helpful I don‚Äôt exactly know what to look for so any tips would help. 

Some more information that may or may not be useful. I don‚Äôt know my exact curl type. If I had to guess it‚Äôs about a 2c/3a. I‚Äôve had this problem with my hair since approximately February/March. I use the sulfate-free Cantu Cleansing Cream Shampoo and it‚Äôs respective conditioner and the Kinky-Curly knot today leave-in conditioner. I‚Äôve used these products for years and while I‚Äôve tried others over the years I have not tried anything recently that would make my hair the way it currently is. I do use a satin bonnet to sleep in at night and always use a wet brush to brush my hair. I have not had a recent hair cut and actually haven‚Äôt been to a hair salon in at least 2 years (I lived in a remote place then COVID happened). 

I look forward to any advice and I‚Äôm sorry this is so long."
