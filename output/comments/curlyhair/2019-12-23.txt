grimalkinlake,ehgxli,"First time trying some of the things I've learned here plus LUS curly products&&&&&&Routine:
I wash about twice a week with the LUS shampoo, then condition mostly the ends with the matching conditioner. First time trying the squish technique! I leave it in for a few minutes while I shower, then detangle with a wide tooth comb. Rinse most of it out except for the ends. 

(I've seen some reports of the LUS shampoo drying out hair, but so far I'm happy with it since I use it pretty sparingly and my hair tends to need a strong cleanser anyway or it gets kind of gummy.)

Next is the all in one. I found the key to the LUS leave-in really is using it on SOAKED hair and that I can use a lot less of it that way, which is nice because I'm used to going through a ton of leave-in. (Helps that I shaved the sides a few months ago too, lol) Comb with a wide tooth comb, shaping any errant curls. Air dry or use a diffuser on cool for a couple minutes if I need it to dry quicker.

The leave-in dries clear. It can leave a bit of crunch, but that goes away after an hour or two of having it down.

All in all, I'm really happy with the LUS products. I used to swear by Alaffia Beautiful Curls, but they discontinued it for good, so I was scrambling for a replacement that gave me the kind of look and feel I liked. I hadn't found anything that worked until now. A nice plus is that althought the Alaffia made my hair look great, the buildup on my scalp was insane. So far my skin has been happy with the LUS products, which is really rare for me."
b00bpunch,ehguf6,"Suggestions for increasing definition without too much product?&&&&&&Thank you for the suggestions! I thought protein would be a bad idea for me due to the low porosity, but honestly I haven't tried it so might as well. I just bought 2 liters of GVP conditioning balm (contains glycerin) because they had a sale :( I guess I'll start with the protein first and then try a different conditioner a little later. I've avoided glycerin before, but willing to try it again.&&&Current routine:
Wash with RenPure Lemon Tea Tree Sage shampoo, then condition with GVP Conditioning balm. At the end of my shower, I flip my head down and squish in Curls Blueberry Bliss Repairative Leave In Conditioner and Aussie Instant Freeze gel. Just yesterday I did a deep condition with Cantu Deep Treatment Masque.

Then I scrunch out excess water with a Turbie Twist and usually plop or pineapple a few minutes. Today I diffused but not always. It feels like it need lots more moisture, but I have issues with my hair getting sticky and weighed down if I use too much product or products too heavy for my hair (such as Carol's Daughter Hair Milk). I believe my hair is low porosity. I also live in a very humid climate."
trevorishy,ehguf6,"Add protein into your routine(products with protein or DIY gelatin and rice water rinse), keep using the strong hold gel, and use products that are lightweight and glycerin free because humid air would make your hair limp or frizzes with the excess moisture, making it to loose curl definition."

paradaart,ehgfnc,Washed hair- Dried after wash and 2nd day after wash with a trim.&&&&&&Awwww thank you! I stopped straightening my hair for more than 3 years and I‚Äôve never dyed it.... That made a big difference.&&&Routine: I wash with shampoo every 3 days but condition almost every day. I comb throughly with my fingers. I apply Garnier Curly smoothie while damped through out the hair and let it air dry. My hair stay good for two days.

Question: Curls seem okay, but the conditioner bar seemed hard to use with my hair and felt rough on my curls during application? I know there is a learning curve, but is there any recommendations and or tips/tricks for using the conditioner bar and getting an even coating?

In the hour since I've seen the movie, I've checked out the pr featurettes and interviews on YTub... She seems to have naturally straight hair, but he is full on naturally wavy. My gosh, he is so gorgeous.

FractiousPhoebe,ehfyi6,Its possible. I had a childhood friend who's hair was straight until puberty then it went to a 3c. I had the lightest wave in my hair before I had my son then hormones decided that my hair is now 2c/3a.
JustASadBubble,ehfyi6,"Idk if you want to get into genetics, but 
 Curly hair is dominant, so they could still both have the straight (recessive) allele, potentially giving you both recessive alleles making your hair straight

Tresemme botanique nourish and replenish coconut and aloe vera conditioner does not contain propylene glycol, so I will probably use that for cowashing. But, I am having trouble finding a good clarifying shampoo and a good gel without propylene glycol that is also a CG approved product. Can anyone help me out?"
AdderallNaps,ehfbgv,"I've had similar situations, and my theory is that it's the refresh that helps things bounce up. If you continually used that sulfate filled shampoo, your hair would get really dry, but when it's been healthy and moisturized for a good while then you scrub all that build up out, it's so bouncy!"

emmalump,ehfbgv,"I was freaking out about forgetting my toiletries and having to use hotel shampoo/conditioner the day of a wedding. Ended up having one of the best hair days since starting CG&&&&&&Oh no!! That‚Äôs how it usually goes for me so I was fully expecting a hot mess today and brought lots of bobby pins and hair ties in my purse&&&Routine:
Like I mentioned, I‚Äôm on an overnight trip for a wedding and had timed wash day so that it would be day of so I would have the best chance with my curls. I realized after I checked into the hotel and didn‚Äôt have time to run to the store so I prayed to all the hair gods and washed with the shampoo and conditioner they provided (no idea what they are, they‚Äôre hotel branded). 

After I got out of the shower I followed my normal routine: Liberally spray with Redken One United multi-benefit spray with head upside down, tousle near the roots to break up clumps and scrunch product into hair. Squish excess water out with t shirt 
Mix fructis garnier all clean gel with Pantene curl affair cream (a few pea-size blobs of each) and then scrunch in upside down. Air dry scrunching periodically (not sure this helps, I just can‚Äôt help touching my hair) then tousle again at the roots for volume!

Edit: I can‚Äôt believe I forgot to mention that it was an outdoor ceremony and it RAINED so this was my hair after getting soaked and redrying!&&&Believe it or not it‚Äôs a wide leg jumpsuit made by Romwe and was $20 on amazon!!

I‚Äôm actually TERRIBLE with eyeliner so I just load mascara on at the base of my lashes&&&Absolutely!! I just did some sleuthing this morning and it turns out the shampoo and conditioner are shockingly GC friendly! The bottle said ‚Äúorganic‚Äù on it so I was trying to convince myself that meant it wouldn‚Äôt have crap in it but at the time I thought I was just telling myself that"
farmerbrit,ehfbgv,Yes! Sometimes your hair just needs to breathe. I'm a firm believer in that.
hatarnardethander,ehfbgv,"My best hair is when I do the least with it - shower, get the excess water out, brush it into place or use my fingers to comb it, and just leave to airdry.

When I start using shampoo, conditioner, leave ins, styling products thats when I want to just shave it all off. Also for the fact that Ive never found a styling product that works for me (mousse, gel, wax, saltwater, beewax, pomade, you name it Ive tried it) so I just got used to leaving it to airdry."

neutralsky,ehfbgv,"Honestly, one day I gave up on always reading ingredients and having to go to a special store just to get shampoo and spending 10 years drying my hair on the cool setting. So I started being more relaxed about CG. I still have a routine that I stick to and certain rules I never break, but honestly there's no noticeable difference. I have good hair days and bad hair days, just like before, only now my life is a lot easier. I even bleached and dyed my hair the other day! It still looks and feels great."
r2_me2,ehfbgv,"Not to be the bearer of bad news but... the pantene cream you're using isn't CG, it has silicones in it. Your curls look great with it though, so who cares, I'd keep using it."
ravenclawster,ehfbgv,"Not getting married but I went through something similar yesterday. I had taken the hotel's little samples of conditioner and body lotion into my shower instead of shampoo. I've heard of co washing before, so tried to drench my hair in conditioner and leave it up to that. Best decision. My hair was looking so good, so glossy and somewhat frizz less."
rochellep504,ehfbgv,I never put product just wash and condition and let dry. I often dont even scrunch and if pieces aren't curled good all I have to do is spray those pieces with just water then scrunch that piece and my hair normally works out good for me. That's with my bleached hair and dove shampoo and conditioner. So nothing special or expensive or even time consuming.

stopmakinghumans,ehfbgv,"You should try Redken Curvaceous full swirl. It‚Äôs the gel and cream in one! I don‚Äôt have curly hair, but my clients that do, love it! Unfortunately the one product probably costs the same as the other two combined. (But you can get points at Ulta?!? üòä)"

No, I'm having issues with gels. Everything I've tried has caused me to have serious break-outs and/or rashes. So far I've tried:
Deva Curl B'Leavin
LA Looks
Kinky Curl
Herbal Essences

I would really love for some suggestions on products that are good for others with sensitive skin because I'm getting close to giving up.&&&Thanks for the suggestion!

- at night I have a night cap , I wet my hair and usually mix in the leave in conditioner mixed chicks and wear my night cap when I‚Äôm sleeping.

So I have a Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie and devacurl moisture lock finishing spray, devacurl scalp and curl revitalization, and devacurl coconut curl styler I have no idea how to incorporate into my regimen.

I also like using this product callled not your mother‚Äôs beach babe texturizing sea salt spray. My hair seems to really like salt water"
