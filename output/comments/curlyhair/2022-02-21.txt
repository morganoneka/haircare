bigbruhmoments420,t37a2r,"is there tension in your hair strands? What I do is to shake my head and run my fingers gently, squeezing the painful spots gently."
emonte13,t37a2r,"My hair follicles hurt if I switch styles between washes. Please help.&&&This isn‚Äôt anything new, it‚Äôs been happening as long as I can remember. It‚Äôs actually one of the reason I cut off almost all of my hair a few years ago. I have curly and thick hair. I‚Äôve been trying to get better at taking care of it because no one taught me how to when I was younger. 

For as long as I can remember, if I switch styles my hair follicles will hurt. For example, if I do my curl routine and let my hair dry down and then I put it up, even if it‚Äôs up for a like ten minutes to shower and stuff, my hair follicles hurt. Alternatively, if I‚Äôm lazy and throw it up in a messy bun when it‚Äôs wet and put it down after it dry or worse if I braid it after it‚Äôs dry my hair follicles hurt. 

It‚Äôs not like an irritating I can ignore it hurt. It‚Äôs like if I don‚Äôt wash my hair and massage the heck out of my scalp I won‚Äôt be able to relax or sleep. 

This just happened to me. Yesterday was wash day and I was feeling sick so I didn‚Äôt do my usual routine I threw my hair in a messy bun and let it dry that way (I know it‚Äôs bad but I was not feeling well and could barely stand) well today I decide to do two French braids and just leave them in for a few days until wash day.

I literally couldn‚Äôt fall asleep my hair follicles hurt so bad. I had it I wash my hair and massage my scalp for a few minutes to try and get relief and I‚Äôm still uncomfortable. It‚Äôs definitely more tolerable but I don‚Äôt understand why this happens. 

Is this normal? Can I do anything to prevent it? I like to be able to wear my hair down during the day but I put it up to shower and go to the gym and then it just hurts. I‚Äôm not putting it up too tight. It‚Äôs only if I‚Äôm essentially over directing the hair. Like if I twist it and just clip it I‚Äôm fine but if I actually pull it up into a mid or high ponytail or bun it‚Äôs unbearable. 

It‚Äôs genuinely making me want to cut all my hair off again."
piqv,t37a2r,I experience the same issue and it‚Äôs because the scalp is dry I heard so definitely find some moisturizing products for the scalp and not hair and also clarifying once a month or once a week helped me I haven‚Äôt experienced any itching or painful scalp

Environmental-Gap-63,t36lb5,19M. Can you please rate the below hairstyles on me. 1st hair straight out the shower. The 2 before the last is my hair when it‚Äôs a bit shorter (the curls tighten). Which do you think is best for me or is there another style you think would suit me better. TIA! PS. know I need to clean my mirror&&&&&&My current hair routine is just washing my hair with water and using nizroal shampoo (i suffered with dandruff which has now gone but just finishing off the bottle haha). Any routine advise would also be appreciated :)

pepsters3,t36lb5,I think the ‚Äúhair shorter‚Äù pic is by far the best look for you. It also looks healthier in that pic
iced_rose_tea,t365ob,"Adding product really weighs down my hair & curls: Help!&&&Hello!! First post here and very new to taking care of my hair in general. I have wavy to curly hair in a wolfcut-esqe cut (so pretty short!) and honestly the only things I have for my hair atm are shampoo, conditioner, and a leave in conditioner; I don't know the brands off the top of my head. I usually don't use the leave in conditioner though because when I put it in, at first my hair will look really good but after it air dries my curls completely deflate and just feel super heavy and greasy. I still have some little frizzy flyaways though, which makes me think I still need more moisture even though adding moisture just makes it look like a complete mess? I don't know if I'm just using too much or if I should be using a different product or anything, any help would be greatly appreciated!&&&How/where can I find these? Again, I'm REALLY new to any kind of hair care haha"
piqv,t365ob,It could also depend on the products you‚Äôre using as well because there‚Äôs lightweight products and there‚Äôs also heavy products I know 2 brands that are semi heavy which is Shae moisture and Cant√π

moonlightwolf52,t35kte,"For my birthday I recieved a hair victory!&&&&&&Thank you! Yes it is! It has really been starting to grey over the last few years but it does wonders for naturally highlighting my dark brown hair XD&&&I‚Äôm still experimenting a lot because the top of my hair is flat and in general very inconsistent on overall look- so suggestions are always welcome!

For this look:

shea moisture curl & shine hair mask for 5 min.

Conditioned with shea moisture curl & shine conditioner let it sit 5 min. Before lightly rinsing

Squished excess water out

Styling (squishing):

Applied Bumble & Bumble Primer

Applied Bumble & Bumble conditioning mousse

Applied All About Curls Bouncy Cream

Applied All ABout Curls High Definition Gel

Applied Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Heat & Humidity Gel

Put duck clips in front sections of my hair diagonally towards the scalp

Lightly/ gently squished with microfiber towel

Air dried about 80%

Hover diffused about when about 80% dried

Scrunched the crunch

Any suggestions (especially for keeping volume at the top of my head) welcome!"

CalypsoRaine,t336ra,"Whats a good straightening tool for 3c AA hair?&&&Hi I'm new. I have 3c AA hair and I'm looking for a good straightening tool to straighten my hair. When I was a kid, my mom used the old stove comb that you put on the burner that straighten my hair. But that's just too much heat.

I have used a few different flat irons gdp, hot tools, babyliss pro, not hot enough to straighten my hair. I have used a couple of straightening brushes, its meh but my roots are still curly and not straight. Tools at the salon straighten my hair just fine.

I'm thinking of buying those hot brushes to brush and straighten the hair before I actually straighten it ya know? Idk what are some good affordable pressing comb to really straighten 3c hair?&&&I've seen that product before ill have to check it out again&&&Chase method, yep, hate it 2 much work and I just suck at it. I do have a blow dryer. I probably would struggle with a round brush lol"
clpolk,t336ra,That looks really interesting. I must figure out where to buy one.
ethnicallyabiguous,t336ra,[This is what I like to use.](https://youtu.be/5ZDHO3PXQQw) setting 4. Then I follow with a traditional flat iron to get the roots.
sade-inthe90s,t336ra,"If you have a blow dryer, you can get either a comb attachment or use a nozzle concentrator and round brush to straighten. The round brush method is a lot of work though, and depending on your skills, you'll probably still have to go over with a flat iron. The blow dry brushes are unnecessary if you already have a blow dryer IMO. 


When using a flat iron, have you tried the chase method?"

playdough422,t309fa,"Hair styling troubleshooting&&&My hair is doing weird things and I‚Äôm not sure how to fix it. It‚Äôs about 2c (sometimes) and I think has quite low porosity.

Two months ago I chopped off a ton of hair (now shoulder length) and began the CGM. I use sulfate/silicone free shampoo and conditioner from Pacifica (with the exception of clarifying shampoo days), follow up by either brushing through or scrunching in Not Your Mother‚Äôs curl mousse, and then scrunch in Not Your Mother‚Äôs curl gel. After it dries, I scrunch out the crunch either with clean hands or a tiny bit of argon oil. 

For the first few hours post sotc, it looks pretty good. Not as curly as I‚Äôd like, but overall it‚Äôs okay. But afterwards it begins to look limp and flat, with no curls and only some waves at the ends. If I twist/braid it and leave it for a few hours, it holds the shape when I undo it, but again, only for a short period of time. I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is, because I‚Äôve tried using more and less product, but that hasn‚Äôt helped. Any ideas?"
