ClevelandAir,9o9b1j,"Curly hair routine since my last haircut = results!&&&&&&My routine has been pretty simple! I cut out all sulfates and shampoo
I cowash every day with Giovanni 50:50 hydrating calming conditioner and afterwards I use some He’s a 10 hair gel. I’m looking for a good leave in conditioner for some days though!"
fauxfoucault,9o9b1j,"Your hair has great texture and shape! That gel mist really jive with your hair type.

My favorite leave-in type products are Kinky Curly Knot Today Natural Leave In/Detangler and Ren Pure Curls Line Leave-In Conditioner. The Kinky Curly product is amazing for detangling, de frizzing, and adding slip to the hair. The Ren Pure is great for overall nourishment. (I like the gel and cowash from that line, too.) You can also use a little bit of standard conditioner as a leave-in. 

For reference, my curls are longer and 3a if that makes a difference for product recs. "

sickassfool,9o96s3,"Hi all!! Why do i have minimal waves/curls when i dont have product in my hair?&&&I've noticed that I have really nice defined waves/curls when I have product in my hair and when I plop. But if I let me hair air dry without product then I have a slight wave but that's about it, the rest is a frizzy straight-ish mess. Do I even have real waves/curls or is it all the scrunch that is making my hair look good with product? For reference, I have been using the curly girl method for almost 2 months. &&&Thank you! I felt like a fake curly girl lol this makes sense!&&&Thank you! I needed this!&&&Thank you! I was feeling like a fake curly girl! Lol! I also was thinking maybe I need to wait till all the damaged hair is grown out and cut off. I will keep calm and curly girl on :) "
smithsara627,9o96s3,I’ve had curly hair my entire life. Sure it’s curly without product but it’s a fluffy frizz ball. You definitely have wavy/curly hair it’s just natural hair needs a little help and encouragement from products to keep it looking it’s best. 
starry-ice,9o96s3,The short answer is that this is normal. It sounds like you do have natural wave or curl to your hair. The product and scrunch just encourages it to stay curlier and more defined. I know I have to have some kind of leave-in conditioner at the very least for my hair to not be a frizzy mess. Don't be discouraged! 
Naiveatheart99,9o87me,"Natural Clarifying products/DIY for those who don’t want to use sulfates&&&So, I’ve heard about about apple cider vinegar and lemon juice rinses. Has anyone tried these
Or others out? What’s your experience? Feedback? 
&&&Goal: To stay as natural as possible and to help other Curly Sisters our. &&&Thank you!"
nemicolopterus,9o87me,"Apple cider vinegar is very popular! Dilute it 50:50 w/ water and don't do it daily.

Lemon juice is not recommended: it's very to acidic and you can get a chemical burn on your skin."
Mk_it_so,9o7pko,"Great start! Love your color. 

Try kinky curly curling custard gel. It doesn’t have the wet look when scrunched out and is very natural and CG friendly! It’s sold everywhere too. Walgreens, Target, etc. "
akamegs,9o7pko,looks great!!! 😚
yikessplash,9o7pko,I didn’t know this was even possible?!&&&
LipstickDipstick86,9o7gku,"Wow very pretty! I’d love to see the finished look and how you wore it for the ceremony...I’m trying to figure out what to do with mine re: veil, head piece etc. Thank you for sharing and congrats again 😍"
TroiDeanna,9o7gku,"Beautiful, and congratulations!!"
alnono,9o7gku,My hair was very similar on my wedding day! So exciting when it cooperates! Also an exciting day - congrats! 
blkmrsfrizzle,9o7gku,"My wedding day curls behaved so nicely&&&&&&Routine:
Aussie 3 min miracle (moist) applied in shower with pray rake method

Catwalk Curl Amplifier applies immediately after shower with pray hands method

Air dry (3 - 5 hours)

Scrunch curls to break up product
Done! 🙌🏽

Edit: formatting&&&I’ll have to send something this evening but I think I have a selfie. Basically I just took the little bits in the front that are in my face on the right (aka my bangs) and twisted them together then pinked it back. My vail didn’t budge and I just threw it close to the crown of my head and called it a day. Full look with make up took about an hour minus dry time. My suggestion is to practice the look your going for so it becomes muscle memory and the day will go so much smoother 

Edit: wanted to add additional photos, hope it helps https://imgur.com/a/TtzxkZR&&&Thank you thank you. It’s always a gamble going natural on such a big day 🙈 "

That being said I just ordered the SheaMoisture low-porosity line from Target and for some reason the 13 oz. shampoo is labeled $5.69 regular price which was a nice surprise. "
Lazylioness17,9o5u8z,"Do you mix the leave-in, curl activator and gel together and the apply or do each as their own step? Your hair is goals 😍 "
fauxfoucault,9o5u8z,Hey! Check out the sidebar and community info page. There is tons of info there. Good luck! A little research goes a long way.
kwheaton11,9o5u8z,"Hey, I'm new to CG myself, but I can tell you the basics! The Curly Girl method was originally a book (which I hear is still relavent). The premise is how to treat curly hair. Here's a link! https://curlyhairlounge.com/the-curly-girl-method-explained 

Good luck! "

👏rake hair upside down and squish to condish, rinse it all out

👏scrunch out any excess moisture (I like to keep it pretty wet so I don’t break up the clumps) 
👏 plop with T-shirt for 5 to 10 minutes 
👏take out plop and very gently make sure the roots of my hair don’t look too crazy 
👏DONT TOUCH WHILE IT AIR DRIES
