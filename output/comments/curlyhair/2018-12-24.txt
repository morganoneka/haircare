Herbal essences bio renew shampoo the argan oil one
Occasionally uses morrocanoil curl cream (I know it has silicones but it's the only one she likes... teens! Lol)"
rainbowfarts4,ab3gw0,"An exciting start&&&&&&About two weeks ago I started ‚Äúlazy curly girl methods‚Äù‚Äîif you will. Leave in conditioner..have always slept with my hair a bun, ditched the brush and continued finger brushing my hair in the shower. 

The top set of pictures is before I did any of that. I considered those good hair days. I just washed and conditioned with Tresemme Luxurious Moisture, terry cloth towel drying..brush and Tresemme Curl Locking spray and air dry.

The bottom set of pictures is about 2 weeks into my lazy curly girl method and an 2 days with a stricter regimen. Finally went sulfate and silicone free. I‚Äôve started with OKAY Black Jamaican Castor Oil Coconut Curls Shampoo and Tresemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner.  Gently palming excess water after my shower and in a cotton/microfiber towel for a few minutes before product distribution. üòè

Flipping my head over and starting with Renpure Coconut Whipped Creme Leave-In Conditioner (palm cupping style) and Tresemme Curl locking spray. (I know technically it contains a derived version of a no no, Alcohol SB, SB-40 buttt technically so does dry shampoo..seeing what works best for my hair)  Finishing with an overnight plopp.

I‚Äôm just beginning so I know my routine will evolve but so far I‚Äôm happy and look forward to more progress. üòäüñ§&&&Thank you so much! Working on it üñ§"
rebeliousswag,ab3gw0,Wow your hair is beautiful!! 
cosmikd3bris,ab316d,"OP, this makes me sooooo happy to see!!!! I wish my parents had taking the time/effort to learn about my hair and help me manage it at a young age. The most help I ever got was with cutting brushes out of my hair lmao! Seriously great work here. You should be so proud! Your daughter is a lucky lady.

Also the comment about alcohols and fussing with products is just ridiculous. Maybe less is more for that comment-er, but that doesn't mean the same is true for your kid! People always forget that curly hair is a vast spectrum. No two heads of hair are exactly alike or will respond the same to products!

Also, a tip for lift at the root (if it didn't improve on day 2): I like to gently push my fingers into my hair flush to the scalp and gently shake/tousle (never rake, obvi). It helps de-crunch my gel and floof me up a bit."
whit1and,ab316d,"Trying out gel for the first time&&&&&&This is the first time I‚Äôve tried gel in my four year old‚Äôs hair. 

Routine: cleanse with Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Conditioner and detangle with wide tooth comb. Rinse most of it out upside down while scrunching and squishing upward. Tie up with old t-shirt. Section hair and put Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie and Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Scrunching Gel into each section and distribute with Denman brush. Scrunched out most of the excess water/products with t-shirt then let air dry. Once dry, scrunched out the crunch with coconut oil and fluffed a little.

Before pic is during drying with the gel in and after pic is at the very end. 

I think there will be more lift at the root by tomorrow after refreshing. &&&Thank you very much. That‚Äôs EXACTLY what I did on day 2 for more root lift. We‚Äôve had better luck since then. Thanks again. "
Gigglescream,ab2ke0,Help! 2 year old has curly/wavy hair with major frizz in back.&&&My daughters hair is a hot mess. I'm not sure what products I can use. I've been using baby shampoo but it seems to dry her hair out. The front has soft curls but the back is a dry frizzy mess. Does anyone have products I can use on her that is tear free?
fotomachen48,ab2ke0,I started using a satin pillow and my hair is less frizzy in the back! I have find curls so s little leave in milk or after conditioning works great!
ThoroughEgg,ab2ew9,"I just co wash on the days I workout!

I have 3B normal porosity hair. I was my hair on Sundays (shampoo, mask and the full routine) and work out every weekday. On Monday and Tuesday nights I usually just wet my hair in the shower and re-gel (it‚Äôs still smooth from Sunday‚Äôs wash and usually doesn‚Äôt need more conditioner yet). Around Wednesday or Thursday I start conditioning. So I do wet my hair every time I work out, I just don‚Äôt always condition or shampoo it. I hope this helps!"
a9m3g7,ab2ew9,"I also usually cowash on the days I work out. I have long, 2b/c wavy curly hair and it has to go up in an invisibobble. Sometimes I can get away with a loose ponytail and the beachy look happens, but mostly I have to re-wet and cowash. When my hair was shorter I always had to re-wet and cowash because the ponytail had to be tighter for my hair to not fall out. "
mississabella,ab2ew9,Not helpful but i find after a day or so the sweat gives me that beach look lol. I also want to know!

OwnLiterature,ab2523,"Holiday Help! How to travel & deal with salt water.&&&This is kind of two-fold.

1. How do you transport your CG products when holiday? Obviously, the big bottle isn't going into the case that'd weigh too much. Any ideas would be good? My biggest problems are how to take conditioner and my gel.
2. How do you deal with protecting your hair against salt water? Specifically long exposure, not just a day at the beach. Preferably simple products and routines. It isn't for me but a dear Uncle that spends about 8 months of the year at sea. He's older as well. So having a luxurious amount of time isn't an option, is there anything simple you'd suggest for it? He's got tight 3B curls, partially going grey. He's complained it gets very coarse, dry, brittle and tangled. His water quality varies from what's on his ship, washing with salt water, fresh water streams from time to time. He's a pretty salt of the earth guy, isn't vain, he doesn't need it styled immaculately or looking for curl definition, just something to help to keep it manageable with a busy life on a boat."
TheAnimas,ab2523,"It is NOT cgm approved but I apply serum to my hair before surfing. I surf 1-2x/week and my ends were getting ruined. My stylist suggested a thick serum and it totally works! I do a wash right after and a deep condition mask 1x week. Believe me, I am aslow maintenance as they get, so your uncle could give it a try. I just keep some in my car and apply it at the same time as my SPF. "
Francheska3709,ab22t2,"6 month CGM anniversary&&&&&&I started this journey last June. I was actually heat free for two years, thinking my curls would come back that way. My curls went away for about a year or so when I turned twenty, but they eventually came back on their own. As I entered my mid twenties to now, they hadn't come back. I figured that was it for me, but thank God for the curly community that I thought of giving my hair another go. 

I wash my hair twice a week, once with shampoo and the other day I co wash:

1. Shampoo with Shea moisture Jamaican Castor Oil/Deva Curl Lo Poo Delight 
1a. Cowash with Curlsmith Curl Quenching Conditional Wash 
2. Squish to Condition with Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus/ Hask Manoi Coconut Oil
3. Praying hands method : Cantu Leave in conditioning 
4. Praying hands: two dime size of Curlsmith Hold Me Softly Style Balm
5. Wet plop for 20-30 min
6. Praying hands: Curlsmith Curl Defining Souffl√©
7. Diffuse alternating medium heat and cold until 90% dry. Then I scrunch out the crunch with Righteous Roots oil
- deep condition once a week with Shea Moisture Manuka honey & Mafura Oil or Curlsmith Intense Treatment Serum and use my Thermal heat cap

- I've been trying the Apple Cider Vinegar rinse every other week for a month now. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. 

I find that I get the best results when I cowash. Unfortunately, my hair didn't do its thing today ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èbut it is what is

I've got so much more to learn, I'm sure you can tell by my routine. I am very open to advice/constructive criticism. 

(If anyone knows how to get the roots to also curl, please help this sister out)

HaveCourageToExist,ab1wky,"If you have low porosity hair, the Tresemme Botanique might be too heavy, I've seen a lot of people having this problem lately and it turned out that they all had low porosity hair and the conditioner is just sitting on top and making the products weird."
Padthaiprincesse,ab1wky,what‚Äôs your routine? 
TheAnimas,ab1wky,"Fellow wavy here. All the products you are using would be way to heavy and rich for my hair! Gives it that greasy/wet look. 
I tried jessicurl, nym blue line, and the cgm starter products and they made my hair look wet all day.
Also, my hair HATES gel, coconut and leave-ins. I swear by Fruit of the Earth aloe very gel. 
My favorite shampoo is Seaweed Bath Company's balancing eucalyptus. 
I also do a lot of masks. "
bisousbisous99,ab1wky,"Any wavies have an issue where your hair looks wet even after its fully dry? I've had this happen with multiple products.&&&&&&Interesting! I will definitely try another conditioner.  I hadn't considered that!&&&Commented my routine in a separate comment. &&&I actually used shampoo today too. I sp it every 3 or 4 days.  I'll keep that in mind for the future though.  &&&My routine is to use the tressame botanique conditioner and co-wash then condition and brush out. Every 3 days I use the deva curl lo-poo. I get the same results with the la looks gel, the garnier fructis pure clean styling gel, and this latest one is the cantu coconut ceiling cream (got a sample size for christmas, so this is the first time I've tried it.). I have tried scrunching out after, but it doesnt really do a whole lot. I dont really get that much of a crunch. In the end I feel that it just ends with my waves/ curls getting separated. &&&[This is my hair just following the basic routine of the tressame conditioner and the occasional low poo.

mrgrinchisameansong,ab1wky,Only if I‚Äôm not using shampoo often enough
valentina__,ab1wky,"Yup this happens to my wavy low porosity hair with lots of products I've tried...anything that's a curl cream, co wash, anything super Moisturizing. Wavy hair is usually not as dry as curly hair unless quite damaged from heat or bleach so we don't need to use thick products or worry about drying out our hair with shampoo as much. Sulfate free shampoos work the best for me, and rinsing out the conditioner. I used the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus curl cream whatever it is and my hair didn't dry for over 24 hours at which point I just had to wash it all over again "

WanderingSkitty,ab1qxd,Miku mermaid is an excellent name. Great colour!
habbae,ab1qxd,"New color...I call this the miku mermaid&&&&&&Thank you! :D&&&Wash day routine: shampoo with nym kale/coconut, condition with suave essentials green apple, style with la looks gel. Plop, air dry, SOTC. 

The color is punky colour lagoon blue. It‚Äôs more of a true blue on platinum hair but my hair was a brassy yellow with my natural roots. Colored over the whole thing and I like how it looks, even though some bits are uneven. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø i blame the bleach job from months ago.

For anyone curious, punky colour has no CGM disapproved ingredients and I‚Äôve had great luck with it. It rinses out easily and doesn‚Äôt transfer all over my shit like manic panic does. It also comes off of skin pretty easily without a color remover. I recommend it!"
Lordoftermites,ab1lky,HELP!! What type of hair do I have and how do I stop it from being a fro. Thx&&&
BeaWhy,ab1a6r,"To wash or not to wash...&&&&&&I am a CG newbie so still trying to figure product, routines, etc.  Currently, I am using Love Ur Curls shampoo, conditioner and styling cream daily and L‚ÄôOr√©al Elvive Rebalancing Shampoo once a week. I just wash, condition, style (I also have to spritz with hairspray that front bit that refuses to curl) and diffuse to blow dry. I do use a microfiber towel to scrunch excess water. Sometimes I leave in a little conditioner.

In these pics, my hair is washed, conditioned and only has a bit of argon oil in it. It‚Äôs air dried.  Being Sunday, that‚Äôs all I managed. Lazy day. 

So this is my big question, my curl/hair doesn‚Äôt survive the night. I‚Äôve even tried silk/satin pillow cases and my hair still goes rogue. This means I have to wet it and use styling cream every day. I don‚Äôt wash daily because I worry that‚Äôll dry it out yet just rinsing and styling could cause product build up. I just want soft, defined curls that don‚Äôt look sticky or like product has been used. Does that make sense.

I have no idea what my curl type is or how to figure that out. In the pics you‚Äôll see the back of my head is super curly. The crown is a different texture than the rest. It‚Äôs a little more coarse and kinky. Looking at the front, I have a cowlick right up top which is straight and falls over my forehead. I hate that bit or hair in my face so that‚Äôs what I spray back. I also tuck hair behind my ears so those pieces have basically been pulled straight over time. 

My last hair cut was in October thus the 90¬∞ angle top and back. I‚Äôve found a Deva Curl stylist in town with whom I‚Äôm hoping to get an appointment. I‚Äôd like a nice shape rather than a box head and am contemplating growing it to a curly bob length.

So, what are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts? I‚Äôm open to all suggestions.....  (Sorry, I rambled a bit.)&&&I think I‚Äôd last about 2 minutes wearing a bonnet. A little claustrophobic here... The spray bottle might be the way to go. Such a good thought!! Thank you. "
generallyintoit,ab1a6r,"Your curls look really great. It's understandable that second day hair is harder because of the short length. If you decide to grow out a bob, you might still have issues with sleeping on it and crushing the curls. I do know what you mean about not wanting a product-y look. You might have luck with lightly wetting the hair without doing a full wash and new products. I use a regular spray bottle of water but I've seen recommendations for some fancy bottles from beauty supply stores for a finer mist. I've also heard of people using both a satin pillowcase AND a satin bonnet, but I've never tried that. If you had such a great hair day with minimal products, maybe you could try a different product for refresh days, like a mousse."
