Acierblade,7wy2gb,"Jeez, lots of curl type posts today. It doesn't matter what your curl pattern is. You need to help your hair become healthy, and curl type has very little bearing on that. You need to determine your porosity."
TheDoctorandDipper,7wy2gb,"Could anyone help give me an idea of my hair type?&&&&&&That's what I was thinking, but it's hard for me to tell because all the guides I saw showed fairly long haired girls. There are certain products that matter depending on your hairtype, right?&&&Routine: In the Shower, 7 times a week:

Head and shoulders dry scalp shampoo scrub into scalp and rinse

Any other random shampoo I happen to grab in the shower after rinsing the Head and Shoulders,add, wash from roots to tips, rinse.

Sauve Professional Conditioner, Wash in hair root to tips, leave in for a minute or two, rinse.

get out and pat/ rub hair dry (or leave damp and let air dry over night) comb in the morning to try and get rid of bed head. No products or anything else like that.&&&I said hair type, I meant curl type. My bad.&&&The test on the side bar said normal porosity"
nemicolopterus,7wy2gb,Wow..in some of those it's barely wavy and in some it's thick bouncy ringlets...I think it's hard to tell until you've gotten them in a healthier place! But maybe 2C?
twentysomething218,7wy2gb,"From someone who doesn't have much money or time to spend on my curls (I've got fine hair, but there's a lot of it). I stick to Maui Moisture, John Frieda Frizz Ease, OGX, and Marc Anthony. Any drug store sells these brands. 
Ditch the comb. Never comb. If you have a brush, burn it. Use your fingers as a comb in the shower with conditioner in.
Hot water on your hair is death to your curls. I turn it as cold as I can stand when rinsing my hair. 
Look up Squish-to-condish. This will save you before you even turn the shower off. Continue to ""squish"" while it dries. 
Use a good leave in conditioner. I use a curl lotion on top of this as my hair never seems to get enough. 
Plop (look it up) if you have time.
I like Garnier Fructis Style Curl Shape Defining Spray Gel. I spray it in my hands and ""squish"" it in. 
Nothing listed here should cost you more than $10 a pop. Also, nothing here is a guarantee as all hair is different and I chose accounting over cosmetology. 
Hope this helps!"
Curly_Edi,7wy08q,"If co washing in between shampoos works for you then that's great.

Shea moisture is a bit heavy for me, you could try other products. 

Also - is there a chance that there could be residual silicone in your hair? Did you use a sulfate free shampoo to transition? Have you used someone else's hair spray/ hotel conditioner/ an old product that contains silicone by accident?"
car_car_lee,7wy08q,"Serious question&&&So I just started dipping and diving into the Curly Girl product world.  I have 3a/b fine blonde hair. I’ve found some products that I LOVE & make my hair look great. My only problem is that after I sleep on it my hair gets frizzy, the curls fall out, and my hair looks so oily. I keep reading to try going a few days between washes, which I’ve tried, but I feel SO dirty and I can’t stand my hair looking greasy. Even if my hair didn’t look greasy, my curls do not look good unless I “reset” it by taking a shower. I shampoo every 3-4 days and cowash everyday in between. I’m trying to ween myself out of the habit of washing it everyday. 

How do you make your hair look fresh & bouncy between wash days? I need to know the secrets

 &&&Yes I did.... I made the transition going on three months now.&&&I feel like the problem may be my shampoo or too much heavy product. My shampoo claims to be sulfate free, but I’m pretty sure there are hidden ones in there. I’m still learning the ingredients to avoid as there is so many. 
Is there a shampoo you would recommend? If Shea Moisture is too heavy for you, we may have similar hair types. "
nakedpastry,7wy08q,Try a silk night cap or silk pillow case to help keep your hair from looking too frizzy. You may be using too much product if you’re getting greasy. Look up how to make your hair into a “pineapple” (look up curly hair pineapple method).
undivcosmia,7wy08q,Did you use a sulfate clarifying shampoo before switching to CG? And how long has it been since you started? :-)
SleepyHipster,7wxstv,"Good curl day&&&&&&After realizing that I had wavy hair I tried to let it takeover, this is after I woke up the next day.

I shower every night, apply shampoo and rinse out as well as I can. Then, I apply my conditioner and let it sit for about 2 minutes, washing it out until it is slightly slick. I then let my hair dry without interrupting it to much. After that I apply [curl activator](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/luster's-s-curl-hair-wave-jel-activator/ID=prod8261-product) and then squeeze my hair to induce some curling, afterwards I leave it alone until dry and brush it lightly.

I know my hair isn't very curly but I've had it straight most of my life so its a suprise."
nemicolopterus,7wxstv,"I'ts hard to tell but mmmmmmmmm you look just like my ""before"" pictures! It took me 3 months and finding the right products (no more shampoo (TRESemme Botanique conditioner only as a co-wash, Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in and Kinky Curly Curling Custard as a gel) but now I have straightup ringlets!

Keep going!!!!"
AnneKaffeekanne,7wxeop,"I live in a dry and windy climate as well and it really dries out my hair. I only just started the CG method and had some success today by using a lot of conditioner, combing through with a wide tooth comb while conditioner was still in, rinsing with luke warm water, and then only squeezing the water out with my hands a few times, laying a t-shirt over my shoulders and letting the hair air dry, making sure not to touch it. I ended up with individual ringlets like you have on your third photo. My hair is a little bit more curly and dry than yours, but it's worth a shot. The key was not to mess with the wet hair. "
bbblsmarie,7wxeop,"I need them curls!&&&&&&Finger curl thing as in wrap hair around my finger? Lol what is this magic you speak of?&&&I normally wash every two or three days with garnier fructis and use a leave in conditioner after the shower by the same brand. I do not normally brush my hair until it is dry unless I need to tame the beast to go somewhere. I live in an extremely dry and windy climate and I do dye my hair blonde (obviously). I normally have it up in a ponytail/pin/clip because I work in the medical field and will occasionally straighten or curl it. The first two pictures is what it normally looks like (If I don't brush it out) but when I go to a much higher elevation and moisture area, it looks like the picture on the end, which is my ultimate goal for it to always look like. I do not like to use products that make my hair feel crunchy or stale, so I usually do not use mousse or gel. Some suggestions on light weight products to help define my waves/curls please!?"
littlecakebaker,7wxeop,"I didn’t figure out that my hair was actually curly until I did the finger curl thing right after I got out of the shower. If I don’t do that my hair looks like I’m a vagrant, if I do I wind up with perfect ringlets. "
G0nbabyG0n,7wwld6,"Untangling&&&I wanted to know when to untangle my hair (before, during, or after washing), how, and how often
Thanks in advance :)&&&Thank you! Will do :)"
munda1011,7wwld6,"Use a spray conditioner and I brush it with a finger brush, best thing everrrrrr."
thunderfierce,7wwld6,"Brush your hair with a wide tooth comb when it’s wet with conditioner, have a look at squish to condish and plopping :) &&&The last two 2 methods have been a life changer! Put some leave in conditioner and plop, depends on how long you like to do it for, but it makes a huge difference!"
Curliness,7wwi9d,"It looks great! Once, I tried clarifying my hair with a sulfate shampoo after having some trouble with buildup, and then followed up with a moisturizing shampoo. It left my hair so tangled that I had to use palm fulls of conditioner in order to get the knots out. Afterwards, it wouldn't even hold a scrunch. I thought for sure I had just ruined my hair and was mentally preparing for the worst hair day of my life.

It dried into the best hair day I had ever had.

I have absolutely no idea how that was even possible, and I've never been able to recreate it again :(

Just goes to show that curly hair is super unpredictable."
jewleek44,7wwi9d,"a quick wash in the sink today and my hair looks the best it has maybe ever???&&&&&&I don't have much of a routine. Even after having these curls my entire life I don't really know the proper way to take care of them.
Any moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, wash with ice cold water, and Marc Anthony defrizzing coconut curl smoothie cream is my absolute BFF."
big_blue_beast,7wwfxs,"Finally grew out my pixie but my curls have disappeared&&&I’ve had a pixie on and off for years. The few times I’ve grown it out long enough to curl, I’ve had nice ringlets, probably 2c or 3a, I’m not sure. I was missing my curls so I grew it out again but while growing it out, I spent two summers working outdoors in high elevation, high intensity sun (I was hoping to get highlights so I didn’t wear a hat, which I very much regret now). Now my hair is very straight and I have tons of flyaways around my hairline from breakages. My question is, do I have to chop it all off again in order to get my curls back? I’ve been getting trims every few months, started using Shea Moisture Strengthen & Grow Leave-In Conditioner and Shea Moisture moisture retention shampoo and conditioner. My hair is still straight, only slightly wavy after I wash it and let it air dry. I like pixie cuts so I won’t mind chopping it off again but I’d really hate to have to start over again growing it out."
blacktieaffair,7wwfxs,"This is anecdotal experience, but I grew out a pixie with hair that was bleached a couple of times and dyed neon colors several times. So, needless to say, the hair was pretty damaged. I started wearing it curly around then and while my routine wasn't as good then, the curls just never fully formed. They were always very thin and strawlike. The second time I grew out virgin hair and the difference was night and day. Some of the very ends were still dyed and they were a bit difficult to work with.

You might get some mileage out of deep conditioning, hot oil treatments etc. Not too sure how much that will revitalize the hair. 

However, you should start to see some improvement as you get more trims and more of the hair is replaced over time. So I think the cost-benefit analysis is keeping your hair long and slightly damaged for a looong time as the hair is replaced vs cutting it all off and taking the time to grow it out again."
nemicolopterus,7wwcew,"It's likely because that OGX has silicones:

http://isitcg.herokuapp.com/Home/Results/9YyLGb9gEirKWK7nUrwZA

And none of your other products have sulfates to wash them out, so your hair is probably coated in silicone and unable to get any benefit from the conditioner.

My first suggestion would be to switch to CG!
"
ughpierson,7wwcew,"frizzy hair even though i condition?&&&my hair is between 2c-3b, the longer part being wavelike while the tapered part is 3b, but my hair is usually very frizzy. i alternate conditioning with either shea moisture jamaican black castor oil or ogx hydrating tea tree oil conditioner every night since i don't have time to wash my hair before school. 

after showering, i use a towel and pat dry my hair and part my hair. i also use not your mother's beach babe sea salt spray and cantu pomade to hold my hair in place. any advice on what to do?"
Deeyer,7ww3d7,Wow. Hair goals!
ItsMe_RhettJames,7ww3d7,"2 years and ~4.5 months. Last trim was back in May 2017. I’m headed to 3 years at least.&&&&&&Lately, I’ve been lightly rinsing my hair everyday then pulling it back. Every three days or so I’ll wash with shampoo and let it down. I’ll condition my hair every week or so.

Today, I rinsed my hair in hot water. I generously applied Dove Absolute Curls Shampoo. From the roots to the ends. I could probably sculpt a masterpiece with my hair. There was more shampoo than I probably needed. Haha! I rinsed it all out while combing through it with a Double Detangler Comb.

Next, I generously applied DevaCurl Conditioner. Started from the roots and combed it through to the ends with my fingers after flinging my hair forward and letting it hang upside down. Got it in nice and flipped my hair back. I let it set in my hair while I washed the rest of myself. After, I turned the water nice and cold. Rinsed out the conditioner while combing through with the Double Detangler Comb again.

After the shower, I put my hair up in a microfiber towel nice and tight while I brushed my teeth and such. Let it down and moved strands of hair in place. I usually add a mousse or gel, but not today.

That’s all! I wouldn’t have any idea what to do with this hair if it wasn’t for discovering this sub way back when. Thanks to all of you!"

tralevite,7wvz8u,"2nd day curl help! (Routine in comments)&&&Hello everyone! I'm fairly new to reddit, but I've been lurking this reddit for the last year. It's helped me so much care for my curls and get them healthy again. So thank you so much for providing me with the the information I needed to get my hair looking it's best!

So my big problem now is second day curls. I have the definition and volume in the length of my hair, but I'm struggling to get rid of the frizz and gain volume at my root after wash day. I'm a 2c/3a in curls so there's some waves and some goldilocks curl in there. 

Routine: 
Once a week I use Shea Moisture Curl and Shine shampoo. I follow up and also cowash every other day with Shea's Low Porosity Conditioner. I scrunch out a little water to avoid dripping and apply my product upside down. I start with SM Milk and scrunch into my ends and upwards, following with two pumps of Deva's Volumizing Frizz Free Foam. And I top it off with scrunching in my own flaxseed gel. I then diffuse until nearly dry and then sotc with my hands and shake my roots out.

I sleep on a silk pillowcase (never tried pineappleing since my hair is an asymmetrical cut with the length varying between below my chin and just at my jaw). And this is where I've tried rewetting my hair in the morning with a spray bottle, applying a small amount of fsg. It just gets flat and wiry looking. The soft curls I had yesterday are lost and it just doesn't look full. 

So there's my dilemma. Is there a different way I can apply morning product to fix this? Thank you for any tips you might have!"

Shampoo once a week with DevaCurl No Poo. Daily I use SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner. After thoroughly soaking my hair with water I apply conditioner upside down, gently raking my fingers through my hair to detangle. I twist the hair on the top of my head and finish my shower. To rinse, I squish to condish upside down until my hair is no longer dripping too much water. Out of the shower, I run SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Style Milk through my hair upside down, squish again then plop for 15 min+. I generally diffuse upside down until 90% or more dry. "
