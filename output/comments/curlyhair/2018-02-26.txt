hashtagmollyno,822ljy,"Tips for color treated hair??&&&I’ve been looking for a community like this for a LONG time! I’m hoping to start trying the curly girl method but my question is are there any products or tips for keeping my color treated hair curly? I don’t like my natural color and color it fairly bright unnatural colors every two months or so, with semipermanent touch ups throughout. "
nemicolopterus,822ljy,"Yeah check out my history for a looooong post about color-treated curly hair. We're lucky since CG-safe stuff is also color-safe!

If you have questions let me know - I'd like to add it to the wiki but want some feedback from someone else before I do that :)"
SpokenShepherd,822132,"Seems like everyone is giving you great links, but just wanted to let you know that I was in the same boat as you. My hair suddenly curled after 17 years into springy tight curls (2a/3c) and I was freaked! No one in my family has long curly hair or any kind of routine. 
In the end, YouTube, this sub and a lot of panicking and anxiety were my saving grace. It's overwhelming, but I promise it gets much easier once you realize that there isn't a 'right' way! You do you, and rock your curls!"
boonslinger,822132,"the sidebar has a lot of great resources for beginners, especially when it comes to picking products and starting a routine"
burnt-pie,822132,"Help!!! Only person in family with curly hair, never learned what to do with it. I need advice.&&&I have 3a/3b curly hair and grew up treating it like straight hair (washing/conditioning with whatever I found at the drugstore, etc.) as of two months ago I started using devacurl and I'm starting to see results BUT:
 I alway find myself feeling a little out of the loop when it comes to the methods lots of girls use (wash&go vs wash days, how often people actually wash their hair with no-poo/shampoo vs just using water, etc.) Do any of y'all have good resources on the very basic knowledge of how to take care of curly hair that seems like it just gets passed down generation to generation?

TLDR: Never had any curly hair ""knowledge"" passed down to me and I'm feeling a bit lost. Got any good resources?&&&thanks so much for the link! I was asking more about things that seem to be common knowledge as opposed to different techniques (plopping, CG, LOC, etc). For example I had no clue wash days were a thing until about three weeks ago, but it seems like everyone has just grown up with it via their parents teaching them if that makes any sense? I find it hard to find info on those things that are like casually mentioned ex: When I first heard someone say ""here's my wash day routine"" I was SO CONFUSED? It feels a bit isolating because it seems as if everyone has this common vocab that I'm missing out on idk :( "
minniesnowtah,822132,"I had straight/""poofy"" hair as a preteen and then bam, all the sudden a hair dresser told 13-year-old me that I actually had curly hair and had no clue what to do. We happened to be walking around Barnes & Noble later that week and ran into [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Curly-Girl-Handbook-Michele-Bender/dp/076115678X) which was an absolute GODSEND.

So no, I never really had any curly hair knowledge passed down, but I really don't think this knowledge is the default. Until the last decade or so, it seems like tactics to ""deal with"" curly hair have been the default and so many of us grew up clueless. But trust us, you can learn ;)"

MeezStephanie,82163i,"I've heard other people say they put a tiny bit on under a hard gel. Tha's what I'm planning to try tomorrow! And hey, your hair looks great!"
NasIsIllmatic,82163i,"Kinky Curly Knot Today too heavy?&&&So I have a mixture of 3b and 3c curls, normal to low porosity. They are pretty short up top (about 2 inches) and I keep the sides/back faded. I really liked the kinky curly come clean shampoo, so I decided to try knot today. I used it as a rinse out conditioner, and it left my hair super soft, but flat and lifeless. Is it possible that I just used too much, even though I rinsed it all out?
&&&Before that I was using Maple Holistics Silk 18 conditioner&&&The weird thing is I used it as a leave-in and though it didn't flatten my curls, they did feel harder the next day (again, maybe I'm using too much for how much hair I actually have). However this time, when used in the shower, it was almost like a relaxer. It is also very frizzy and straw-like.&&&So today I washed with come clean after the gym, conditioned with silk 18 and applied knot today (wanted to give it another shot) to my soaking wet hair. I then applied some LA looks nutracurl gel and let air dry. This is my hair now, fully dried https://imgur.com/a/XoKeO

Shine is nice, but the curls are much looser than they usually are and there's a good bit of frizz. Almost seems like my hair is always curlier the day after. "
duckorrabbit69,82163i,"3a low porosity here. I really like knot today, but I picked it because I was trying to cut out protein and I think my hair is protein sensitive. 

Knot today doesn't contain any protein and maybe you need some? What conditioner did you use before? "

tinybac0n,82163i,I was using Come Clean and Knot Today together for a long time and couldn’t figure out why my hair was limp. I swapped out the Knot Today for As I Am Leave-in and I am loving the results. Now I only use Knot Today as a detangler when my hair gets super knotted. 
Ratchetist,820wl9,Looks like a 3A
Summersmum,820wl9,Looks like you will be a 3a.
Yoliwankenobi12,820wl9,"Day one on this method, need help figuring out my curl type. Hair is about 80% air dried.&&&&&&Current routine: I used a sulfate free shampoo, haven't tried cutting this out yet. Using pureology (I know it's not CG friendly but it's what I've got atm) I detangle using my fingers while working the conditioner in, and rinse. I work in some more conditioner plus gel while my hair is still soaking wet then use a t-shirt to scrunch. Ive tried plopping overnight before but I found that it flattened my curls and I lost a lot of definition. No diffuser used. Thanks! I'm so happy to have found this subreddit. 

Edit: thought I should add that before I decided to go natural, I would wash and straighten my hair once a week, so it's fairly damaged. I'm not happy with my length, so if you've got any tips on styling short curls I'd be so happy!
&&&Thank you! I kept going back and forth between 2C and 3A."
BPWonderWoman,820s51,"Yeah, girl!  I just recently made and fell in love with FSG too!  I absolutely love it.  It does take time to make, and has a bit of a funky texture, but the results are soooo worth it!!!!  "
nemicolopterus,820s51,Looks great! How much gel did you use?
vampyrotoothus,820s51,"Flax seed gel is where it’s at!&&&&&&Today wasn’t a wash day, but I did re-condition my hair with Deva Curl One Condition, so there’s that. (Squish to condish method)

I made my own flaxseed gel using 1/4 cup flax seeds, rinsed before boiling in a cup of distilled water. 

After painstakingly making the gel, I added a dash of vitamin e oil for preservation and a few drops of grapefruit essential oil so I don’t smell like a flax seed. 

My hair is still slightly damp in this photo but I loveee this gel!&&&It’s such a pain, but it totally pays off! And so much cheaper than deva curl gel which makes my hair pretty frizzy tbh. "
amylarsen111,820kmj,Diffusing upside down and clipping your roots both help!
fartheadfarts,820kmj,"Hello everyone! You have beautiful hair! Any advice on how to get crown volume? I’m trying to grow out my hair and it sometimes falls flat from my crown. I have low porosity, 3a/3b curls. Thank you!!!&&&&&&Thank you! I’m going to order them right now!&&&Thank you!"
vampyrotoothus,820kmj,Get those little silver hair clips from deva curl! I pin my hair up while I’m driving an hour to work and it really helps :) plus it dries my roots a bit faster. 
Dyanuh143,820f97,They've done that with a few of their products. Wish they'd let us know they changed their formula!
Lady_diana,820f97,"A lot of the time when I buy this brand, the consistency varies. Every time it works wonders though. I think because it’s a natural product, it’s not going to be exact every time - but same results"
bluethreads,820f97,"As someone else said, the texture of the product does vary.  One time I purchased it, the product was very thin, almost soupy.  I returned it and exchanged it for a new one which had a more normal consistency.  "
envydub,820f97,"has anyone who also uses this noticed the new texture/smell??&&&&&&this is my main product, so I’m a little worried. I opened this new tub and I noticed it didn’t seem as thick, the texture is similar to yogurt now. and it smells less coconutty than it has in the past. has anyone seen anything about a new recipe? is it just me?&&&I definitely believe that, this would just be my first experience with a different consistency of this particular product after like... three years of use so I was really worried! I don’t like change!"

gettingfiscal,81zzjg,How long since starting the routine did you notice curls? I constantly flat iron my hair because my hair is so dry and lifeless but I want to get my curls back. 
heroineoftime01,81zzjg,"A much needed haircut brought my curls back to life&&&&&&ROUTINE:
Wash every other day with Garnier Sleek N’ Shine (the paraben free version), condition with the Sleek N’ Shine conditioner. Then I’ve recently started using Not Your Mother’s Kinky Moves curl cream and I’m really loving it! 

I spent years flat ironing my hair, and it would just leave it dead and my curls suffered, which made me want to flat iron more. I’m taking the steps to take care of my hair now and kick the straightener! &&&I only cut my hair about 2 weeks ago! Cutting off the dead ends and staying away from my flat iron almost immediately made a difference. "
sleepyinseattle95,81zi2o,"Haircut place in Seattle&&&I’m in the Seattle area, and I was wondering how “Zero Zero Hair” is for cut and color.

splattermatters,81zi2o,Sensa Salon = curly girl Mecca! I've heard mixed about Zero Zero. 
TheCastleDash,81zh41,I follow a stylist on instagram that is in Spark I think? Is that near you? It's called Desert Curls Studio or @desertcurlsstudio on IG. 
amateursexoffender,81zh41,Devacurls website has a way to search for devacurl certified stylists near you. 
catsandcappuccinos,81zh41,"Looking for a curly hair stylist!&&&Hi all!

I hope I’m posting this in the right place, if I’m not I’ll gladly remove it and post it where it’s more appropriate! I just moved to Las Vegas and I’m in need of a haircut. I’m willing to shell out a pretty penny as I only get my hair cut once every 6 months. Does anyone have any ideas where I can find a curly hair stylist?"
Conehead43,81z16w,Somebody posted this in menshairasvice. Does anybody known how he gets his curls to look this. What products do you think he’s using?&&&
fntastk,81z16w,"Honestly this looks just like my brothers hair. And my brother literally only uses water and some sort of redken leave in. Occasionally he uses Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls (we both love this) but he only needs water basically and his hair looks like this, dare I say even curlier/springier?

I think it all boils down to hair type at shorter lengths. "
grief_is_tedious,81z16w,"Looks gross to me. I think this guy has 3c hair and either has a few day's worth of product buildup, or maybe natural oil/dirt buildup. Likely some combo of the two.

No doubt there are some weird products that are designed to look like this, but I'm sure they're expensive and full of all kinds of nasty ingredients."
killedthespy,81yvub,"Yes! I have a spritz bottle that’s 1 part LA Looks Spiked gel to 2 parts water, and I added a few drops of lavender/sandalwood avocado oil into it to help provide moisture. I spray it all over,, then rub some between my hands and smooth down around my head before scrunching a bit. I let it air dry and then scrunch the crunch out. 

Sleeping with a silk pillow case was a game changer for my second day hair. I use a super loose hair tie and do a high pony tail. In the AM I take it out, spritz and I’m good!"
marsglow,81yvub,You can get your hair wet every morning- just don’t use shampoo on it.  I use Shea Moisture cowash .  It’s great.  Use like a conditioner but don’t use shampoo first.
reese-pieces,81yvub,"Advice of Second Day Hair&&&Hello all, I need some advice on trying to tame my second day hair. Right now I’ve been washing my hair every day because sleep pretty much ruins the structure of my curls... the only way I can get them to look good is to get them wet again. However, me being a college student, styling my hair sometimes isn’t an option, due to late night studying and early morning classes. I need help: what’s the best way to make your second day curls look as good as the first? (Preferably as affordable as possible!)

Edit: forgot to mention my routine. As I am a college student, I really just use whatever shampoo and conditioner I have to use up. Right now it’s an old set of Biologe shampoo and conditioner. After that I wring out my hair and finger comb the curls before applying SheaMoisture curls smoothie cream and a sample of It’s a 10 leave-in product. If my hair is feeling particularly unruly I use Moroccanoil to tame the flyaways. I also use hairspray to keep the curls from falling apart by the end of the day. &&&One thing I am worried about is product build up. Do you think this causes your curls to look too “crunchy”, for lack of a better word?"
what_the_whatever,81yvub,"College student on a budget here! I bought a spray bottle and made a mixture of 3 or 4 parts water and 1 part a mixture of conditioner or shea moisture curl milk and a little gel. You want it to be basically water with a little slime/sticky to it. Shake it up or use a whisk or a fork and then spray it all over your hair until it's damp. I have 2b/3a curls and after I spray all over I smooth my hair down and use my fingers to make the curls clump and then I use my diffuser for maybe 30 seconds on each section and then don't touch it. When I get to school it's usually completely dry so I flip my head over and shake at the roots and scrunch my hair.

It takes me probably 5-7 minutes in the morning. I can do it even when I don't want to get out of bed for my stupid 7:30 am class."
