coolerkid9090,tj2dbt,"Broken hair regrowing&&&I get a lot of hair that breaks or falls out. When it grows back it‚Äôs a lot shorter than the rest of my hair and forms these short, little curls on the front of my head and then other individual hairs just stick up, making it looks very frizzy. I usually have to wear a cap to flatten those hairs in the morning, which works for a while, but eventually those short curls will stick up again. By the time those short hairs grow long enough to blend in with the rest of the hair and not stick out, there will be all new short hairs that grew back and are sticking up. What can I do about the existing hair? And what can I do to keep my hair from breaking/falling out so much?"
MostIndependent386,tj2biw,"Help, is this unhealthy?&&&I have really really coily, tight, thin strains of hair. Over the past 2 days my hair has been falling out like crazy after I shower and comb, like I could pull on it with a little force and a couple of strands come out. I have to admit though that prior to this I only washed and combed my hair once a month, due to reasons I don't feel comfortable disclosing. Is this just the months of dead hair falling off or is this a serious medical issue? I am not diagnosed with any physical diseases as far as I am aware.  
Edit: I am 17 years old&&&I'm a little overweight, but nothing out of control. I try to workout every day, and I eat relatively well. I have no documented physical diseases, but I do have some mental ones.Also a side note on the hair thing, it doesn't seem to be coming off from directly on my scalp, at least it doesn't feel so... It seems to be just hair that is just there trapped under all of my curls, but then again I wouldn't know. I'll try seeing a doctor regardless."
vanitythr0waway101,tj2biw,"It doesn't seem normal to have hair come out if you pull on it a bit. Definitely try to see a doctor.

How's your overall health?"
AdventurousDoubt1115,tj1wdb,You have awesome hair!
Automatic_Ad112,tj1wdb,Pretty hair and it suits you. You‚Äôre cute
No-Collection-6982,tj1wdb,I like 1 pic . Big volume

jigguta,tj1wdb,"I love your little fangs! Also your faces aren‚Äôt dumb, you‚Äôre very adorable. At your texture, you‚Äôd probably do fine with either a wet or dry cut!"
rylandarnett,tj1wdb,"hi!! do you think that my curls/waves would benefit from a dry cut / curly cut when the time comes? (pics from most recent (last night) to least recent (december))&&&&&&thanks! it's been a journey to get it this far but i'm excited to see what it grows into :)&&&please excuse my dumb faces, good hair days make me too happy to look normal!

my routine is different for almost all of these pics, but mostly scrunch w/ cream and gel and diffuse (pixie) method. 

i don't really type, but i believe the types of curls i have range from 2a-3a, mainly in the 2b/c category. 

i have been told that i should stick to wet cuts since my texture doesn't hold very well when wet, and since i have very few spirals. i feel like wet cuts don't do well for my hair, and i'd much prefer a dry, no-products-other-than-mine cut to a wet, product heavy cut. is thid something feasible or should i stick to straight hair salons?

+you can see how the cgm has improved my pattern and definition! the first are last night and the last is December.&&&thank you so much! i have a strange habit of blinking in selfies, but i try my best :p. i haven't ever had a dry cut (asked for one once, stylist ended up heat curling my hair instead -> twas weird) but i'm open to trying everything."
themessynmafia,tj1wdb,"It looks like you‚Äôre  getting great cuts already -  your hair is beautiful! so, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to make much difference. I think it‚Äôs a great experience for anyone on their curly journey to do one time IF, and ONLY if it fits your budget. If you have a great stylist already, you can skip it. For me, it was nice to see and feel the techniques of cleansing, conditioning, and styling  in person. I was able to see what I was doing right, and what what I could  do differently. Surprisingly, the curl specialist that I went to, didn‚Äôt use all the ‚Äòby the book‚Äô products. It was an interesting experience and one where I learned to know what I will and will not pay for, and tolerate after all the time and energy I put into improving my hair. Enjoy your lovely curls, and your own journey however it best suits your life!"

Super-Ad-9059,tj1job,I‚Äôve been growing my hair for a while should I cut it off soon?&&&
Vulturette,tj1job,You have beautiful curls!  If i were you id let it grow!  But if you shaved the sides and back and left the top curly like a pompadour type look i think thst would cool too.  But seriously i vote that you grow it out!  Best of luck!
Alert_Run9118,tj18ab,"Hair has stopped growing properly.&&&Hi, 

This is my first reddit post. I am having a really awful time with my hair lately and I thought making a post might be therapeutic.

Essentially, I used to have beautiful curly hair. So much so that people would compliment me and ask if i was using a curling iron. 

In 2020, I began to have problems with what I thought at the time was frizz. I cut off my bust length hair at the end of 2021 hoping to alleviate the issue. Instead the frizz became unbearable. Initially I put it down to products, and spent a month delving into the curly girl method and testing more organic products. 

It was during this time I began inspecting my hair and began to notice that the ""frizz"" was actually hair that seem deformed. These strands of hair are kinky, thick and wirey. When I feel these hairs, the hair shafts feel twisted. 

They are completely alien to the rest of my hair. It seems like the entire outer body of the hair is made up of them. I have looked up pili torti and the hairs seem similar to the examples. I have actively avoided researching this further because it sends me into an anxiety spiral. 

I will be going to a tricologist tomorrow, which i have been desperatly waiting for, and I will post an update. 

I would be very greatful for any encouragement or positive anecdotes as I am feeling very hopless. 

Thank you"
fackshat,tj18ab,I just came across your post and was wondering if you have any updates on this? I've been dealing with something similar and was wondering if it might be deficiencies (I'm working on bringing my iron and vitamin D up). Sorry I don't really have anything helpful to add. I hope everything turns out to be okay/manageable.
DephosieDracaenae,tj13je,Pantene as a rule is awful for hair. I wouldn't suggest anyone use anything of theirs

annabelle6784,tj10s8,"I use the Bumble and Bumble Sunday shampoo. It is chelating as well as clarifying since I live in an area with  hard water. A bottle of this stuff lasts forever.

Vulturette,tj0zud,You have beautiful hair first of all.  Second i recommend the curly girl method.  Cmg for short.  I also recommend a trim and a good leave in like infusium.
kittycatlady22,tj0zud,"Do I need more gel or something else?&&&&&&Routine:

Usually I use HiBar solid shampoo & conditioner (moisturizing kind). This time I just did the shampoo and used kinky curly knot today - rinsed out most in the shower even though it‚Äôs a leave in.

ETA: my other problem is that I have crazy curls underneath the top layer of wavy to straight hair. I‚Äôm hoping this will eventually change‚Ä¶ but it might just be what I‚Äôm stuck with."
inv_dore,tj0dlv,"Can‚Äôt see why not 

Funnily enough, build up, dandruff, dry scalp, and Seborrheic dermatitis are unfortunately common issues for people to start having after starting CGM or their own version of it.

I personally use head & shoulders shampoo and a clarifying shampoo while practicing a very loose version of CGM. I also use tea tee oil to prevent dry scalp from occurring. It‚Äôs caused no issues for me personally.

mrsGutterButter,tizsp6,"Hair suddenly curling/waving? Pls help&&&Okay so after 28 years, my hair decided it‚Äôs going to start getting wavy. All new growth coming in is curling/wavy so I have a wavy mess on top and soft waves/straight hair on the bottom. My friend said I might have curly/wavy hair since it‚Äôs so dry all the time and poofs/frizzes like crazy any time I brushed it. 

I stopped blow drying it and straightening it for a bit and the waves started so I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs right lol 

I want my curly/wavy hair to look as nice as possible so I‚Äôve been trying to look into the curly girl method and have started the following:

-stopped brushing. Only use wide tooth comb in shower 

-washing hair once a week with shea moisture curl coconut and hibiscus shampoo/conditioner and leave in milk (all Shea moisture curl coconut and hibiscus) 

-trying ‚Äòsquish to condish‚Äô but idk if I‚Äôm doing it right. Practice is perfect I suppose :\

-plopping after shower with leave in milk for about 20-30 minutes then air dry. 

I live in the desert where there‚Äôs hard water so I got some Ion hard water clarifier and use it once every 4 weeks and then I just bought JessiCurl to deep condition after. It won‚Äôt be here until Wednesday so I‚Äôm not sure how that will work after the clarifier but hopefully it‚Äôll be good. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do or where to start. Can you please recommend me products or videos or anything. 

My hair is a frizzy mess and the curls on top where the growth is looks like a tangled mess (it‚Äôs not tangled, just looks like it) and I want beautiful waves/curls like everyone one here <3

EquivalentCommon5,tizblj,"As many have said - Pls go to a doctor, I was losing my hair by fist fulls‚Ä¶ it was my thyroid but there are other causes."
Head_Reference_9704,tizblj,First it‚Äôs time to cut it. All that breakage is just going to keeping going up and cause everything to be worse. I know studies have shown that rosemary water or oil (I can never remember which one) has decreased hair loss  in people. I say give it a try!
Informal-Value-5817,tizblj,my hair was falling really badly as well until i stopped washing it every day. i also use a homemade rosemary oil and water (jusy boil rosemarry in your preferred oil and it‚Äôs the same step for the water just replace oil for water). apply that on your head after you shower but don‚Äôt rinse it off.
Ms_ChiChi_Elegante,tizblj,See if u can get ur vitamin d levels checked‚Äîthat helped a lot of people I know‚Äîincluding me!
O2B2gether,tizblj,"Be careful with coconut oil, for some it can cause breakage.

Over the years what used to be full is now how it‚Äôs pictured and has been falling out. I‚Äôve tried different products but I‚Äôm not sure what else to do since these products don‚Äôt seem to be working. I‚Äôve tried bounce curl but it was too heave for my hair. I‚Äôve also tried Innersense but didn‚Äôt really notice a difference. My hair is really fine. Right now I‚Äôm using Carol‚Äôs daughter Goddess Strength shampoo and conditioner.

Any tips on I can get my hair to get thick again?&&&Thanks you so much everyone! Very helpful. I will get my appointments in order and come back for an update as soon as I have one!"
Successful_Worry6593,tizblj,Could be stress from Covid. It‚Äôs a real thing. Maybe cut it with layers. Could be just phase but idk.
avianak01,tizblj,"I would definitely recommend going to the doctors like people are saying, but as a temporary option I recommend rosemary and peppermint castor oil!! I have a small bald spot due to stress and a bad habit of pulling out my hair and I noticed a big difference after using them. I mix a few drops of each into my shampoo and conditioner and continue my curl routine as usual. It really helped me a lot, the hair in that bald spot grew a ton around a month or so. Good luck to you on your efforts and I hope everything goes well with the doctor!"
honey_biscuits108,tizblj,"First step is blood work to see if you have any major nutrient deficiencies or underlying thyroid/ endocrine issues.  Start taking a quality women‚Äôs multivitamin if you don‚Äôt already. 
I‚Äôd trim a few inches off or even go much shorter to keep it looking fuller. 
Don‚Äôt over wash, go light on product for a while and stay away of coconut oil. It will make your hair more brittle and prevent it from absorbing the humectants in your hair care products. 
Look into high frequency wands. You can purchase one on Amazon that has attachments for skin and scalp. They help bring blood and circulation to the scalp to encourage hair growth. I use one on my clients for hair loss all the time. It has a little rake attachment and feels great."
mattressfortress,tizblj,"Yup, def see your doctor or a dermatologist. There‚Äôs many different things that can cause hair issues, from vitamin D deficiency, thyroid issues, PCOS (androgenic alopecia), long-term anxiety, and about a hundred other things.

If you try and figure this out on your own, each treatment will take months to start seeing genuine regrowth. Since you have already lost a significant amount of hair, skip the time and cost and work with a medical professional to see what‚Äôs goin‚Äô on! 

Anecdote: I have PCOS and lose hair because I have too much testosterone. There aren‚Äôt any good over-the-counter treatments to fully address my exact situation so I take meds ($5/month with insurance) that help balance my hormones to the way I want and have lots of new hair growth. A blood test confirmed that my other levels are fine, but trying products for my thyroid or random vitamins would‚Äôve taken years!"
originalpickle13,tizblj,You should really go see a doctor. Significant hair loss is often a symptom of other underlying problems.
shreya044,tizblj,"It is important for you to get your thyroid checked as that will help you eliminate it as a cause for hair fall. Second thing is it could be due to stress in which case it would be temporary but what I think could help you is making sure you eat sufficient protein, using coconut oil before washing would prevent the hair from drying and falling out. I had tried a combination of coconut oil, protein and yoga for stress reduction. You can even include a collagen tablet. If there‚Äôs an underlying cause then just externally using products would not help solve your problem. Lastly, shorten your hair length so that it would be more manageable for you to care for it at-least till the time your hair fall reduces"
tanyamothertucker,tizblj,Hair fall can be a sign that your thyroid levels are off. It  may be good to check in with your primary care provider.
