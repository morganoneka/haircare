Emerducks,frjnco,"I‚Äôm going to call him Bob.&&&&&&I‚Äôve been lax with my routine recently due to not leaving the house, but this is what I‚Äôve been doing

-Wash scalp and roots of hair with Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs baby moisture wash

-slick mid lengths to ends with TREsemm√© Botanique coconut aloe conditioner (the basic CG method recommended one)

-Comb gently through conditioned hair

-Squish to condish, then do the rest of my shower routine, leaving the conditioner in

-rinse out conditioner, more squishing to condishing

-step out of shower, gently squeeze hair with t-shirt to dry

-be a goddess"
iambob-6,frjnco,I will always be with you
musicalgeek123,frjnco,Hi Bob! Looks great :)
TigerLady-TX,frjigw,Great curls!
jael73,frjigw,"It looks great!! Here are some tips I have to offer:
Depending on how thick your hair is try shampooing every 2 to 4 washes or however often works for your hair.
Depending on your porosity, find a good leave in conditioner. It takes 2 seconds to put on. I have high porosity hair and I find that the Kalahari Smoothie Leave in from Curls Dynasty is like a holy grail for me!! The first time I used it my hair was so ridiculously different... Smoother, shinier, softer, everything good! The ingredients work well for high porosity hair. 
Finally, this is completely optional depending on how much you care about styling/frizz/definition, but try using a gel to scrunch out with. I like LA Looks Extreme Sport *alcohol free* gel. (blue) A lot of curlies seem to favor this gel and it's cheap, too!
Best of luck and I hope this helped üòä"
petulent_sweatpotato,frjigw,that‚Äôs it????? also the pic in the background looks nice (from what i can see of it)
thebeardedbean,frjigw,"One of my better curl days, but could use some work. If anybody has tips let me know.&&&&&&Thanks&&&Thanks all the info is very helpful. I‚Äôll give it a try&&&Routine: 1. Used Pantene conditioner, no shampoo. 2. Washed it out then got a towel and patted it dry, and squeezed the water on the ends of my hair. 3. Sometimes I brush my hair when I‚Äôm not lazy. 4. Let it air dry."
Runemist34,frjgsd,I am bamboozled by your hair just... bouncing back like that! Amazing!
Scribblr,frjgsd,"I mean, yeah warn them and make sure they know what they‚Äôre in for, but she shouldn‚Äôt refuse a service that someone is asking for.."
becka92189,frjgsd,Might just be your curl pattern. Probably nothing wrong with your hair
bubbalooski,frjgsd,Bouncy!!!!
curvyandcurly,frjgsd,"Right? I have healthy virgin hair and there's no way it would come back from brushing it. Frizz is forever (well until wetting my hair next).&&&I always wanted lighter hair, but I really don't want to go for it for this exact reason. Maybe I'll invest in a wig one day lol."
eggy635,frjgsd,Bleached hair looks great but at what price&&&&&&It‚Äôs not mine! She‚Äôs @bumbunniii on tiktok
fives8,frjgsd,"I have bleached hair and honestly I think if people know the risks and want it anyways, why not go for it! I knew it might relax my waves and I was ok with it. I do more deep conditioning now. LOVE my platinum blonde!

It‚Äôs ok to have bleached hair if you want it. Hair grows back."
helen790,frjgsd,"I never bleached my hair but if I run a brush like that through my curls they will react more like the bleached ones, what does this mean?"
jtlibra92,frjgsd,Lmfao! I almost died when she said ‚Äúow‚Äù at the end hahaha relatable as hell when you combing through expecting no knots or tangles
katieknj,frjgsd,My hairdresser almost refuses to bleach curlies because of this. She says it‚Äôs way too hard to get the natural pattern back and almost never worth it.
lanatlas,frjgsd,Bleached hair five times. Can confirm.
mo_unhas,frjgsd,Now I know what‚Äôs wrong with my curl pattern...
myfriendsfoundme-1tm,frjgsd,Lol looks like someone is getting real bored in quarantine
aitch83,frjd26,"I need (a lot of) help with diffusers and my sister‚Äôs routine!&&&My sister‚Äôs a curly haired gal (3a/3b) who just started taking care of her curls better. She‚Äôs using sulfate free shampoo and conditioner (Garnier Fructis Curl Nourish) and something called Miss Jessie‚Äôs Multicultural Curls (is this a gel? A leave in conditioner? I‚Äôm not really sure and I just want to make sure she‚Äôs using it right). Is there anything else she should be using? There‚Äôs this video going around (from TikTok) where the girl uses a leave in conditioner, a gel, and some sort of oil in her hair after washing it. Should she use an oil too? What sort of oil? What sort of gel?

I‚Äôd also like to buy her a diffuser but I don‚Äôt know where to begin. Are all blow dryers created equal? How do you know what diffuser to get for your hair dryer? I‚Äôve also seen different types (the DevaCurl hand shaped one vs the flat and round ones) ‚Äî does one have an advantage over the other? Is it damaging to use her diffuser every time she washes her hair? Does she need to redo her routine every time she washes her hair regardless of whether or not she shampooed it? 

I‚Äôm sorry if these are stupid/basic questions ‚Äî I‚Äôve scoured the Internet for answers but I can‚Äôt figure this stuff out. She struggles with some stuff but she‚Äôs very excited to have a curly girl hair routine, and I‚Äôd really like to encourage that, so if there‚Äôs anything else we/I should know, please leave it down below as well! Thank you!"
curlyspirals,frjd26,"[Start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fpb715/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is), really read the link to the CG guidebook."
PurpleFishDontExist,frix4c,"I have super thick and fine 2b curls, and have been struggling with an itchy, rash-y, sensitive scalp my whole life. 

The only thing which seems to really cure/control it is Jamaican black castor oil. I picked [this](https://www.jamaicanblackcastoroil.com/sunny-isle-jamaican-black-castor-oil-root-repair-4oz) up at Tjmaxx. JBCO is anti-fungal, which keeps whatever causes the itching under control. It also moisturizes the scalp and roots, helping prevent dryness. From what I‚Äôve read, and my limited experience using it‚Äîbought it a couple months ago‚Äîit seems to encourage rapid and healthy hair growth. 

JBCO is very heavy and doesn‚Äôt wash out easily, so I‚Äôll wet my scalp and massage the oil in, then leave it overnight so my scalp and roots can absorb most of it. In the morning I use a shampoo (Currently [Ursa Major Go Easy Shampoo](https://www.ursamajorvt.com/products/go-easy-daily-shampoo), but this works great with my clarifying routine too!) Then I follow with a deep condition. I‚Äôll rotate this routine with my cowash and low-poo, which takes me about 1.5 to 2 weeks. If I remember right, JBCO should only be used up to twice a week, so this works great for me."
curlyspirals,frix4c,Read the section on [scalp conditions](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vSvGm-p4tvrstjT-XEo6pTHZSYeEON7xF5lPSnNv-3Kc2lCrdnkjXhFbdHt4pF3HUetWZ1j9dgfBBkS/pub#h.gftsz0mcevko) in the CG guide. If a product is causing burning then stop using it. You might need to see a dermatologist to see if you have seborrheic dermatitis or something else.
maddenm2,frix4c,"Cleansing Routine/Scalp Help!&&&Hey pals! I have 2b/c curls and i‚Äôm really struggling! I can‚Äôt seem to find a scalp cleansing routine that works for me!

Washed hair with Kinky Curly Come Clean Moisturizing Shampoo

Parted hair into 4 sections and applied Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave-in and combed through each section starting at the ends. (Apply all products to ends first and work way up)

Afterwards applied Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Style Mix. I flipped my hair and just applied to all sections of my hair and scrunched it. 

Then I let it air dry. My hair took like 4 hours to air dry and even in the photo it wasn‚Äôt 100% completely dry but I was getting tired of waiting lol. Afterwards scrunched and done lol."
BrightBluePajamas,friqj5,Best silver lining I‚Äôve heard so far.

CoconutCrepe,frhoxo,Are you combing your hair after it dries?
puppiesrmyweakness17,frhoxo,"My hair is so freaking frizzy... Nothing seems to help. Any suggestions?&&&&&&My hair routine goes as followed: Wash my hair twice a week using WOW Apple Cider Vinegar shampoo and conditioner and sometimes if it feels really dry then I will do only conditioner (something like Pantene or similar). I dry my hair with a frizz reducing hair wrap. Comb my hair out and apply oil, frizz control gel, mousse, and leave in conditioner..... I have to work with my hair up so I usually braid my hair and wrap it in a bun and then when I get home and take it out and take care of it, I wake up the next morning and it is extremely frizzy and there‚Äôs no controlling it.&&&No"
WeAreStarless,frhluf,try a rice water rinse! that's a boost of protein without having to buy a whole new product
jillyhumes1,frhluf,"Light protein product&&&Looking for recommendations for products that have slight amounts of protein. I have 2C/3A high porosity hair. Lately, my curls feel almost too moisturized so I was thinking trying protein might help balance it out. I‚Äôve never done protein on my hair so I‚Äôm a little worried. Thanks!&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you so much!"
scarlethands,frhluf,"Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-in conditioner has protein and is still pretty moisturizing. It's a good place to start when trying out products with protein in them. Also, the Giovanni 50/50 line has protein, but I'd be careful about adding Too many protein products at once. Try with one, then add more if you need them."
LOLARISX,frhj07,I think it looks amazing! Would love to hear that SM shampoo. My hair is so frizzy (yours is not at all) but I cannot not wash my hair any longer than 3 days. Co-wash was disastrous for my scalp.
flowerpowerlex,frhj07,"A ""good wave day"" before vs. my first (reset) day of CGM. I've always wished my hair was wavy like my mom's, turns out it is!&&&&&&Today's¬†routine:

1. Shampooed with v05 Extra Body shampoo (found it on sale and it fit the reset shampoo bill).

2. Flipped my head over and conditioned with a handful of Tresemme Botanique Nourish & Replenish conditioner, then finger combed through it once slimy.¬†Squished palmfuls of¬†water into my hair to get the extra conditioner out, but made sure to leave some in. I may have needed to leave the conditioner at the slimy stage for longer since I suspect I have high porosity. I'm not sure when to start squishing.

3. Put a golf ball-sized amount of LA Looks Extreme Sport into my hair (this part was intimidating) and tried to squish¬†excess water out of my hair in the process.

4. Plopped for 20-30 minutes with¬†a t-shirt.

5. I don't have a diffuser attachment, so I diffused a little bit on low/cool by scrunching handfuls of hair up to my roots and letting the air hit it for a few seconds.

6. Scrunched out the crunch once it felt dry.


I definitely think I started scrunching a little too early, which led to some lost waves and added frizz. Also still figuring out how/when to part my hair without separating the waves. Bought a mini Wet Brush to use in the shower while my hair is still full of conditioner, I may try to part it then. Picked up Shea Moisture Hi-Slip Detangling Shampoo since my hair gets oily really quickly and¬†tangles like headphone cords. I usually wash my hair every other day so I'll stick with that for now, but I'm hoping to wash less as time goes on. Feel free to tell me if I need to tweak or try anything, I'm still learning!&&&Thank you! I'll let you know how it works out for me! My hair has frizzed up significantly today after sleeping on it so I'm gonna see if I can plop with a silk scarf tonight. If it's wearable in the morning I'll roll with it, if not I'll wash it with the SM and start all over!&&&Aw, thank you! I caught these pics on good hair days, but hopefully CGM will give me more of those!"

astralcat214,frgx6k,"I've been playing around with my routine, and I can finally have nice Day 2 hair.&&&&&&
Hair type: very, very fine, a little thin, normal/slightly oily, low porosity, 2B-3A curl type mixture.

Products used: 
Garnier Fructis: Pure Clean gel
Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle
Shea Moisture Frizz-Free Mousse
Not Your Mother's Curl Shampoo
Shea Moisture Curl and Shine conditioner

My routine: 
I wash about every 3 days. I shower in probably way too hot of water, but it helps with shampooing low porosity hair. I use the Not Your Mother's Curl Shampoo most of the time but will sometimes use a sulfate shampoo. I apply Shea Moisture Curl and Shine conditioner, finger comb/wide tooth comb my hair, and clip it up. At the end of my shower, I let down hair and rinse out the conditioner. I then gently rake Shea Moisture Frizz-Free Mousse through my hair. I flip my hair to either side to apply the product. I take a bit of the Shea Moisture Curling Gel Souffle and scrunch that in all over, flipping hair to each side and finally all the way over. I top it off with a bit of Garnier Fructis Pure Clean gel scrunched all over. All of this done on super wet hair, slowly scrunching out the water. After all that is done, I get out of the shower with my hair still flipped and scrunch out the rest of the water with a silk cap. Flip it back over finally and fix the part and twirl any pieces. Air dry until ~50% and add a little more Pure Clean gel. Air dry completely, and scrunch out the crunch with a tiny bit of the same gel."
