cafeum,ss17on,"i‚Äôm a male and i cut the sides of my hair so my curls don‚Äôt hang off the sides like those tik tok kids. i still have curly hair covering my forehead that sits above my eyebrows though. it doesn‚Äôt look like those tik tok kids as much, but there‚Äôs only so much you can do. also, i cut my hair shorter so it doesn‚Äôt look like a mushroom or anything. if u have a big forehead i would rock the curls in the front imo. growing a light stubble or a beard will make you look older as well."
yeoxd09,ss17on,"Hairstyle ideas for me? (male)&&&So I'm kinda struggling right now, I have curly hair and a very big forehead.   
My concern rn is that I look wayyy too young with the typical curly hair covering my forehead (i guess similar to the tiktok kids).  
Pulling my hair back makes me look more of my age but at the same time my forehead looks too big.   
Any curly hair ideas for men that make you look older?&&&How many inches long is your hair in the front? (forehead)"

genovianpearfarmer,srzd1f,"Fellow half Asian here and YES! It's honestly the biggest area of bicultural/biracial/whathaveyou miscommunication between my mom and I.

But she has zero appreciation for my new lifestyle of not brushing my hair, even though I try to convince her that brushing was the source of the poofiness.

I've tried explaining CGM multiple times and her response is, ""if you want curly hair why don't you just put it in curlers?"" (Ironically, she's a woman of the 80s so she and her friends spent YEARS with their own hair permed to high heaven. So I guess I can't blame her for going straight to the curling iron lol.)"

Busy_Huckleberry_134,srz813,"New to curly/wavy haircare, would love some routine help!&&&&&&Thank you so muchü•∞&&&Hey all! I‚Äôm new to Reddit haha so please bear with me, but I‚Äôm 17 and recently figured out that I have wavy/curly hair and have been trying to figure out how to care for it. 

I wash my hair every other day/every two days
-Wash with Head and Shoulders (I have scalp psoriasis and my derm told me to use it)
-Condition with Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner

After showering, I comb and then apply the following while wet by raking through and scrunching:
-Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie
-Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly

Then I diffuse my hair (I don‚Äôt really have my diffusing technique down yet haha but I‚Äôm working on it!) to about 85% dry and then air dry the rest. I shower at night bcs I‚Äôm a student and my school starts early, and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf before bed. 

When my hair is diffused and mostly dry, I really love the way my waves/curls look and how defined they are. When I wake up, though, it‚Äôs lost most of its curl and then as the day progresses my hair straightens out until it‚Äôs pretty much just voluminous and straight and I put it up because I‚Äôm tired of looking at it. My roots also tend to look greasy and gross even the morning after wash day and have very little volume. Overall, my hair feels pretty dry and coarse. I‚Äôd love some help with my routine/tips on how to get it more moisturized + healthy and to better hold a curl. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks :)"
Floor_number13,srz813, In the same boat as you. Just wanted to say your hair color is very pretty. üòä
DiaPanquecito,srz72j,"I tried 2 new things today&&&&&&Soooo,I tried 2 new things in my routine today! (also,I fluffed my hair for this picture, it has volume but not as much)

I washed my hair with my always now, the head and shoulders with caffeine and the girls with curls conditioner.

For styling I used the 2 new products, the Cantu curl activator and the behairful brush; I thought it would look different, but honestly it probably was my ""first time user error"" (I normally use the girls with curls cream, or the argan oil herbal essences, and of course the denman brush)

Cantu cream: I'm amazed of how it activates! I used it with really wet hair (because it has a lot of oils and my hair is medium/low porosity, so I normally damp style), also I think I used way to much (because my hair was really wet). I feel it a bit weighed down, but like I said, I think I used way to much. I need to try it with damp hair, and want to try it with the denman, and other time just scrunching.

Behairful brush: I sectioned my hair in top and bottom, upright styling and brushing from below and away. I don't have that much hair (my hair strands are thick, that's why I don't look bald), and this brush creates more tension than my d3 with full rows...alsoI tried it first without any product first,and it did clumped my hair way more than the denman. I want to try it with my everyday creams to see what it does (specially with the girls with curls, because I feel that my hair outgrew that cream)

Lastly, I used the girls with curls gelee and dry it with a diffuser...I want to try the cantu cream by itself and airdrying to see how it works&&&If you're talking about thr chart, I don't know. I don't type my hair becase I feel that is wavy and curly and that the typing chart doesn't give me any useful info (I usually say that my hair is between tight waves and loose curls). In the characteristics, my hair is medium density, but my strands are thick (and it's why it looks full), and is medium to low porosity"

ADogNamedPen239,srytdv,"Mine takes all day and it‚Äôs an endless source of frustration for me. Part of that is because I‚Äôm disabled though, it takes me longer to do some things than it does other people. I shower in the morning, apply products and microplop, then I have to rest for a bit because just that takes a lot out of me. Next I start diffusing, but my hair is REALLY thick so even with my dyson it takes a while and I usually don‚Äôt have the energy to do it completely. So I‚Äôll get it as far as I can and then spend the rest of the day air drying it, and end up SOTC around 6 or 7. So I get to enjoy about 3-4 hours of my washday glory. I hate that I can‚Äôt have washday hair on the same day I see people besides my husband, but such is life. I settle for day 2 refresh hair being my standard look, and that‚Äôs ok! It‚Äôs better than exhausting myself and being in agonizing pain trying to rush my routine to go out to do something after the whole process"
SpudsMcStingie,srytdv,"How long does your curly hair routine take? Morning or night routine?&&&As with many of the curl routines here, it is mentioned that you let your hair dry completely before scrunch the crunch. How long does this process take? Do you do it in the morning or the evening? My hair takes literally hours to dry. I can't imagine getting up early enough to make it happen as I already get up at 5am. And not sure how I'd do it at night seeing that I'm a morning shower person and have no desire to shower twice a day just so I can do my hair.&&&I'm the opposite. I find skipping even one day of washing my hair to be the worst. Its super uncomfortable for me, so I wash my hair everyday day. After the was I put in curl cream and put it up in a tshirt towel wrap. It will stay in the wrap from the next 25-30mins while I get dressed and make breakfast before heading to work. As I'm walking out I take the wrap off and then simply hope for the best.  I'd love to try the gel process, but can't imagine fitting it into my schedule with how time consuming it seems.&&&I've tried the route of defusing, but it causes issues with my neck and back and even after 30-40 minutes its still not dry. And being one that washes my hair daily, even your process wouldn't work for me unfortunately. I've never really gotten to try gel as an option for this reason. I've been a cream user for years and have just given up on going to work without have wet hair. Curly hair is a process for sure."
gg135,srytdv,"I usually only style my hair on weekends. my hair down just bothers me while I‚Äôm doing my work and I‚Äôll end up putting it halfup for most of the week, and by the weekend when I have something to do I‚Äôll want to wash it again. now I just part it in the middle and slick it back to a bun and that is so much easier (another plus to this is that my products last longer)"
kateyes67,srytdv,I only wash my hair once a week and it's always when I'm off work. So on work days I only need to touch it up.
sugarpenchant,srytdv,"I try to save hair wash day for a day off or day working from home, but if I can‚Äôt swing it then I wash the night before and go to bed with wet hair and regret everything by morning lmao a good refresh in the morning can take 5-20 minutes depending on how much needs to be done and how much I care about it.

constantrem,sry9w0,"I began wearing satin night caps instead of my usual bun to reduce hair breakage during sleep- my 'baby' hairs are getting long now! Been about 2 months.&&&&&&Routine. It is very basic and I am trying to cut down on breakage/split ends. Cut off a few inches to get healthy ends and I am trying to keep my hair as split end free as possible in order to grow it longer. 

2in1 aussie moist shampoo/conditioner. Not every shower.

SHOWER FILTER FOR VERY HARD WATER

Leave in aussie conditioner after shower that I do not rinse

B&B super gro extra strength coconut oil hair balm stuff before bed and when wet (a fingertip-full is the perfect amount for my hair)

Typically air dry it in a braid or ponytail with a satin hair tie (do not like wet hair touching me and I prefer to wear my hair up out of my face anyway)

Sleep with a satin nightcap low on my forehead and nape of my neck with a beanie on to help keep it on my head. I have breakage around my face and edges of my hair, as well as a ring of breakage from ponytails with regular ties. I now tie my hair in a bun/braid with no hair tie or satin hair tie.

The satin stuff I am using is probably not true satin as it was sorta cheap off Amazon just to try out but I LOVE the difference in my hair enough that I am going to shell out for a higher quality set of caps and ties from real satin or silk. Sanitize them pretty regularly due to just straight hygeine/acne since I want it on my forehead. Not really sure how to care for them honestly-need to look it up. Right now every so often I soak in hot water/oxiclean and run em with just hot water in a short cycle in my washer and air dry them. Also a 30 dollar shower filter has absolutely been worth every cent for my hair texture and dry skin. I have crazy hard water. Should have done this months ago. Been doing this entire routine about 2 months total.&&&Good to know, haha"
Psychological_Bad175,sry5c4,"How do I keep my hair from getting messed up while the day goes on?&&&My hair is to my shoulder blades and I‚Äôm pretty sure is 2C.

Later on in the day my hair always loses its volume and becomes extremely undefined. Is there a way I can prevent this and make my hair hold my curls better throughout the day?

(All the products I use are from ouidad) My routine is:

1. Shampoo and conditioner
2. Put my head down and  Rake leave in conditioner through soaking wet hair
3. Scrunch it in a lot of times
4. With my hair still down over my face, scrunch in gel 
5. Put hair back into place and scrunch some more 
6. Put clips in the front strands of my hair to prevent weird shape
7. Let air dry"
JestersDead77,sry4pt,"I normally give my hair one last pass with the de-tangling comb after product goes in, then part it and scrunch. I think as long as the comb is gliding through your hair with no resistance, you don't have to worry about breaking strands, etc."

Born_Ad_4826,srx4ic,"Human to human, I say- try cutting it!
Less hair = less work less product less styling.
(It also means less weight so you might get more volume but probably less frizz?)

Your hair looks like mine and my curls LOVE a good cut. They bounce when some of that extra weight & hair is removed.

So if you have a curly hairdresser you like, I say GO FOR IT."
Bubbly_Tackle_5768,srx4ic,Noon! Don't cut it all off! It's beautiful you just need to learn to tame it!!!
FlightyFaerieHeart,srx4ic,Do what makes you happy. Though I personally love big wild curly hair.
HonestlyRespectful,srx4ic,"I think it's beautiful. Going shorter will make it even bigger. I think you're being too hard on yourself. It looks good to me. Have you tried paring back?

Of hellish experimentation after chemical straightening, trying to rejuvenate my curls. A den man brush, curling cream, diffuser, and curly cut later, my curls are still frizzy and it feels and looks like a rats nest even on wash days. I don‚Äôt even notice a difference on wash days. My hair is low porosity and I have so much wet frizz even in baths. The moment I slide the den man brush through my soaking wet hair, it bounces into these broken-frizzy damp curls. This is upside down. Then, I  scrunch in a water based curling cream. Finally, I diffuse my hair upside down. When this routine is done, my hair is a frizzy mess with mildly discernible curls at the ends. I have tried protein masks. I have tried a no protein routine. I have tried no sulfates and silicones, and the opposite. NOTHING WORKS TO QUELL THIS FRIZZ. I‚Äôm at my three years long wits end. I am at a loss of how to define my curls. If I don‚Äôt handle my hair to a satisfactory degree by the end of 2022, I WILL GO BALD. I AM SO SICK OF THIS RATS NEST. I AM SO SICK OF BEING THOUGHT OF AS UNRULY AND DISGUSTING BECAUSE OF MY HAIR.

StringOfLights,srx4ic,"Your hair is amazing, but I can also understand why it would be frustrating. I‚Äôm really sorry anyone ever judged you for your hair texture, that should never happen. 

It sounds like you‚Äôve been trying just about everything. Protein/moisture balance is my usual advice and you‚Äôve checked that! 

If you‚Äôve done a lot of chemical straightening and you think your hair might still have some damage, have you tried Olaplex? It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs a bond builder and I‚Äôve had it help my curl pattern before. It won‚Äôt fix breakage, obviously, but it does help. 

Also, do you live somewhere with hard water? I‚Äôve realized recently that that is messing with my curl pattern. I stayed with a friend for a few days and had amazing curl definition. Came back home, lost the definition. Sure enough, [I‚Äôm not alone](https://www.maneobjective.com/2018/10/how-to-fix-hard-water-problems-with-natural-curly-hair.html). It‚Äôs worth looking into, it made more of a difference than I expected. 

You probably have already, but have you tried squish to condish? Does it help any curl clumps form?"
Vulpixii,srx4ic,I think your hair is beautiful but if you really feel frustrated and want to try something new you‚Äôd look super cute with a curly pixie cut! Maybe something like this? [example pic](https://i.imgur.com/2zO0KD1.jpg)
aj120390,srx4ic,"Do it. It‚Äôll grow back, and will be so much easier to maintain at a length you‚Äôre happy with

I was in a similar situation. My hair sat at about my mid back, and was in such bad condition it got to the point of taking 30+ minutes just to detangle, even when full of conditioner. I had it cut to ‚Äústill long enough to tie up‚Äù (I worked in a kitchen) and noticed an immmediate difference. Now it‚Äôs at jaw length, I use so much less product, so much less time to maintain, and looks better than it ever did. 

If you‚Äôre not ready to go fully bald, maybe just speak to a stylist about shorter styles. You can always change your mind and shave it later"

flovvey,srx4ic,"Your hair looks literally so much like mine did!! Maybe mine was slightly more frizzy and more weighed down (it was very long). I was like you too, I tried everything to like it and make it healthy. But I still hated it. I finally had enough and thought ""why am I still clinging to my hair? I've always hated it. I don't want to keep fighting myself everyday"". And it clicked. I went to the salon and shaved it off! Lemme tell you, the literal and emotional weight that lifted off me in that moment was insane. The more she shaved I couldn't stop smiling!! I was crying I was so happy and for the first time did not hate how I looked in the mirror!! 
And my curls I could never tame? After a shower they just curled right up! Perfect curls I always dreamed of. Effortlessly!! 

If you are unhappy with your hair and want to cut it, DO IT!!! You already want to, so think about how happy you will be once you finally do!! This is your sign!!


Look up some short curly styles ( I looked at men's curly fohawks) and book that salon appointment!

Good luck!!"

Sometimes simplicity works best. Good luck"
marlonbrandoisalive,srx4ic,"Wow, it‚Äôs beautiful!!

I totally wouldn‚Äôt cut but of course if that‚Äôs what you really want go for it.

Have you tried oil based products? Like argan oil and coconut oil."
meowtimegang,srx4ic,"Have you tried deep conditioning with heat? I have coarse, low porosity hair and it‚Äôs very hard to moisturize. I bought a portable dryer hood for my blow dryer and after washing with Malibu hard water shampoo, I conditioned with Jessicurl deep conditioner. I put a shower cap over it then used the dryer hood for 15 minutes, then let it sit for 30. My hair felt much softer afterwards. I had to cut out protein, coconut, polyquats, glycerin, heavy creams and oils.It‚Äôs takes very little to develop build up, then it looks frizzy and dry. The Science-y Hair blog is a good resource for information about this."
mistermughlai,srx4ic,I'm curious about your method for putting your product in? Especially your gel. I'm always super deliberate about putting product in in sections and kinda forming the curls as I go. also I know you said you had a curly cut but.. maybe a better one? Lol that feels dumb to say but I feel like a good shaping could do wonders
moth_6684,srx4ic,"Apologies if this has been suggested, but when you use gel do you let it dry completely and then scrunch out the crunch? I usually scrunch with a little bit of argan oil and it does help a lot‚Äîbut as other commenters have said, not everyone can get the same kind of definition. For what it‚Äôs worth I also think your hair looks awesome as is, and simultaneously I feel the frustration. Good luck!"
puppypooper15,srx4ic,"Have you watched Manes by Mell on YouTube? Her videos were really helpful for me in figuring out what products to use and how to style my hair

When you got your curly cut did you like how the stylist styled your hair? Do you know what products they used?"
rbkc12345,srx4ic,"I like it how it is, but it does look like a lot of work.  Shorter might be easier to deal with.  Not all curl types are defined chunks, your hair is PRETTY!  Voluminous and airy.  

If you are really craving definition, find a curl stylist, someone who specializes in curly hair and can cut in layers that help it to self organize more.  


But if your hair type is fluffy, can you just love it?  It doesn't look bad at all in this picture. Maybe set it on rollers or in twists sometimes for the defined look?"
renegade_kitty,srx4ic,"I think your hair is gorgeous! Straight up jealous of your curls. Check out the curly hair line by Lush. The leave in (Super Milk) and curl cream (Curl Power) is really quite nice for slicking back the flyaways and frizz. Warning, the leave in smells like cotton candy. This is a good thing or a bad thing, no in between. In terms of brushes, check out the Felicia Leatherwood Brush. Don‚Äôt get the knock off. And if you want to cut your hair, cut it. A good cut to take care of the ends can really help in defining your curls!!! 

Just know your curls are enviable and fabulous!!!"
sakura94,srx4ic,"Personally I love big mood hair, but I get your frustration. 

I know you've tried many methods, but the above description of brushing with the denman BEFORE scrunching in product might be part of the issue. It is possible all strands are not being evenly coated, especially on your mid-lengths as you get closer to the root (notice how your ends are more defined/styled than the rest of your hair). I always use the denman AFTER I have added my styler. Hair glides along the curved rubber base allowing for an even distribution, smoothing the strand in one direction (less frizz) and encouraging waves/spirals to form based on your curl pattern (tension effect). If you are only scrunching styler into hair that is already in frizzy clumps from using the denman on wet hair without product, it won't change the shape of the clumps or restyle them (stylers don't make your curl shape), and you could be applying product mainly to the ends by only scrunching, which is why they look more defined.

Try applying your styler in sections first and brushing each section with the denman to form the clumps. Personally I use only flaxseed gel, so I can go pretty close to the root while styling without having scalp issues. If using a cream styler, I try to avoid brushing too close to the root to avoid product build up at the scalp (a real concern for us low po curlies!)"
sdjackie8,srx4ic,Have you tried gel?
tapdance00,srx4ic,"Have you tried getting a cut that removes/thins out some of the volume lower down? Personally, this is a must for my hair given the volume. May be worth trying if you haven't already."
thorifonly333,srx4ic,"I think your being hard on yourself. I know we can all be guilty of looking in the mirror and only seeing what we don‚Äôt like. I think your hair is bloody awesome if that helps. Seriously, looks incredible."
tinyjacks,srx4ic,"When are you applying products after you wash? If my hair is not sectioned into 6 and completely saturated before I apply a heavy cream/leave in conditioner, my hair gets frizzy immediately. Add some water from a spray bottle again on top of the cream and then go in with some gel. I prefer ecostyler or xtreme wetline gel. 

For whatever reason, my hair doesn't cooperate with being diffused so maybe you can also try airdrying. Since you said your hair is low porosity like mine, it'll take a long time but almost no frizz for the first 3 days.

Also most places where you can get a curly cut can give you a consultation on what will work best for your hair. 

Your hair is absolutely gorgeous but it's totally up to you want to want to do with it."
seisen67,srwrp6,"First, look at your stylist social media.  If they don‚Äôt have curly haired clients- cancel!   Second, take pictures of what you do want and what you do not want
Third, do not worry about their feelings.  You are paying, maybe a lot, for this service.   The whole wet dry thing is IMO overrated but TALK to the stylist about it.  Ask why wet over dry, etc.  ask her not to take much off, that you‚Äôd rather her do a second pass if it‚Äôs too long.  Ask about a return touch up policy"
