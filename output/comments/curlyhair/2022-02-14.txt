1MoreTiredTeacher,sxkhao,Oooh they look so flexible! Beautiful!
Sherlockiana,sxkhao,"Pineapple is looking niiiiice tonight!&&&&&&Fantastic compliment! I love it, thank you!&&&Routine: Wash 3 times a week with Love Beauty Planet shampoo (I rotate scents) and then S2C with LBP conditioner. Gently squeeze with a T-shirt to remove most water, then apply equal parts Biolage Styling gel and Cantu Curling Cream with praying hands. Scrunch, then plop in old T for 20-45 mins. Let air dry then SOTC (scrunch out the crunch). 

To preserve overnight, pineapple as shown. Sometimes the pineapple looks cool."
bgmshmr,sxkhao,You look like the adorable protagonist of a Jane Austin film !
egg_sandwich,sxkhao,I think nice is an understatement! You have beautiful curls!!
resistjellyfish,sxkhao,Lovely hair!
ADinosaurNamedBex,sxkcwc,"Have you tried a scalp scrubber? You can get them on Amazon and I definitely see a difference when I don‚Äôt use mine. 

I have something similar and my hair dresser wonders if it‚Äôs build up as my doctor said it didn‚Äôt look like dandruff or psoriasis."
Minerva_Moon,sxkcwc,"I wonder if it's anything like infant cradle cap. Try putting olive oil or baby oil on your scalp and letting it sit before doing a normal hair wash. Also, maybe change hair brands. Sometimes, I  think my hair just has enough of a brand and will refuse to work with me until I switch it up on it."
curvyswag,sxkcwc,Sounds like it might be residue from your products. Are you completely rinsing out shampoo and conditioner.  What stylers are you using and do they mix well together?
fairlyegotistical,sxkcwc,"dry scalp&&&so my scalp... i thought it got better when i started using a dandruff shampoo but it didn‚Äôt.. there‚Äôs a bunch of white little stuff and it‚Äôs making me rlly insecure :( my sister has a bunch too. i‚Äôve tried clarifying shampoo and and dandruff shampoo, but it doesn‚Äôt completely get rid of it. pls help!&&&ive tried a scalp massager from curl smith... is it‚Äôs like white stuff that after u wash ur hair don‚Äôt there but when it dries appears near the areas ur scalp is visible? also pls link the scalpbscrubber :)&&&sorry for my grammar and spelling, i was writing that at 3 am&&&i did, but sadly didn‚Äôt do anything :(&&&can u link one of the oils anywhere on amazon?&&&how do i pre poo lol"
jkflipflop2212,sxkcwc,I had this problem until I just ditched shampoo all together and started cowashing. My scalp gets dry really easy apparently. You could try a cowash.
moosiemoop,sxkcwc,"Have you tried pre-pooing? I know some people use conditioners/deep conditioners but I‚Äôve found that oil works well too! I have low porosity hair so I use a light oil like sweet almond oil, but there are a ton of options! I leave mine in for at least 30 mins and then shampoo and conditioner as normal. I‚Äôve noticed a HUGE difference in how itchy my scalp is and haven‚Äôt had as many flakes (at least not until after a few days when I need to shampoo again)."
vwjetta2017,sxkcwc,I agree. Used a brand for months and my scalp said no thank you. Also try tea tree oil!
nxnabae,sxjt1d,"I need help finding if my hair is curly&&&hi guys i need help finding if my hair is curly, When i come out of the shower my hair is curly and for 3 or 4 days after a shower my hair still has some curls and it fades away after 5 days or so and turns back into being wavy/straight. Do I have curly hair?&&&thank you I'll try doing that"
pluto_has_plans,sxjt1d,"Sounds like! Some of us don't go that quite long between washes, so maybe try at least wetting and styling your hair on the forth day and wee what happens. Good luck!"

ceiling_fan_on_high,sxj24x,L'Bri! I love how soft it makes my hair and tames the frizz.
ximeni,sxj24x,I‚Äôm really liking Curlsmith‚Äôs Bond Curl Rehab Salve.
WeAreStarless,sxiewn,"seconding what the other commenter said. you can't ""thicken"" hair with products -- the l'oreÃÅal and the other brands are just preying on your insecurities to get you to buy their products, they won't actually do anything"
anxi111,sxiewn,"Help: PCOS/Anxiety/Stress = hair thinning&&&My hair has been thinning for over a year now. I‚Äôve tried switching shampoos (shea butter, garnier whole blends now using a L‚ÄôOr√©al thickening shampoo) but haven‚Äôt seen significant results. I have also tried the fable and mane hair roots oil and am now on the ordinary‚Äôs hair oil. I feel like the ordinary hair oil is the only one that showed some results‚Ä¶ 

 I don‚Äôt use much heat either - maybe once a month, with heat protectant.

I don‚Äôt want to use medicines or minoxidil just because it‚Äôs a forever thing - once you start if you stop you go back to where you were.

Any recommendations ? I have low porosity 3A/B hair‚Ä¶"
citygirl03x,sxiewn,"Also dealing with the same for many years so I feel you. I'm trying to balance my hormones because that's the root cause. I have high androgens with high DHEA and testosterone, and also high cortisol. Also have insulin resistance so working on that. So I take a few supplements to correct all this along with zinc, vit d, and b12. Have you got your bloodwork done? 

I also use topical products though because I feel the need to still do something without using minoxidil. I also use the Ordinary hair oil (and have seen it work in the past), Bondi Boost intensive hair spray and procapil hair tonic, and Virtue flourish hair density booster all the night before I shower. Yes it's a lot but I'm desperate. Do not use Olaplex - there's recently been a lot of stylists claiming it is causing hair loss for a lot and Europe actually banned certain products. Apart from this I use some oils occasionally but only AFTER I put the above because oils alone will dry your hair contrary to all the hype out there. My hair stylist also got me using a leave in conditioner spray after washing my hair to prevent further breakage. I've been wanting to use a homemade fenugreek spray but just haven't gotten around to making it. Hope this helps."
lavender_and_teal,sxiewn,"With PCOS, you really have to get the hormones under control. OTC treatments won‚Äôt really help. I suggest you try to lower the androgens through diet, exercise, and speak to your doctor about spironolactone/ other treatment options."
katichichori,sxhtr8,What products are you using ?
savvyington,sxhtr8,"advice for my hair? (details in the comments)&&&&&&Kristen Ess Moisture Rich Curl Shampoo, Not Your Mother‚Äôs Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter Curl Defining Conditioner (or the As I Am Classic Leave-in Conditioner), apothecaryBLVD Thickening Biotin Leave-In Spray, Urban Therapy Twisted Sista Curl Perfection Cr√©me Gel&&&hi there! i‚Äôm growing my hair out from a buzz cut and it‚Äôs at my shoulders now. growing up my mom ruined what curls i had by straightening my hair super often, and i didn‚Äôt have any products targeted towards curly hair so i never even knew my hair could be this wavy/curly. 

my hair now looks better naturally than it ever has at this length or longer, but i still have NO idea what i‚Äôm doing. one of my biggest problems is that though my hair will be nice and curly after washing it & using curl cream/gel, it loses its hold a lot over the day and ESPECIALLY if i sleep on it. like i wake up in the morning looking like a mess after going to bed with relatively neat and defined curls...

nothing i‚Äôve tried so far has worked and i feel pretty lost because of it! another issue is that because i‚Äôm growing my hair out, some parts are weird lengths, so i have annoying bangs that don‚Äôt curl as well as the rest of my hair and makes my hair look messier (in my opinion). 

my current hair routine and the products i use are: 
(every couple/few days i wash my hair)
-wash with Kristen Ess Moisture Rich Curl Shampoo & Not Your Mother‚Äôs Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter Curl Defining Conditioner
-if i don‚Äôt condition in the shower, i use the As I Am Classic Leave-in Conditioner
-i use the apothecaryBLVD thickening biotin leave-in spray
-i use the urban therapy twisted sista curl perfection cr√©me gel
-i use a microfiber towel/head wrap while it‚Äôs drying but i don‚Äôt think this does much for style as much as it does to hold product in.
-i have a silk(?) pillowcase but i always forget to use it.

my questions: what products/brands/techniques do you recommend? can you identify anything i‚Äôm currently doing wrong? would you recommend i sleep with a bonnet or something similar?"
katichichori,sxhe81,"Hair feels sticky?&&&Hi guys! So I‚Äôm a newbie taking care of my 2C-3A wavy hair. I have had success previously when I used L‚ÄôOr√©al Tecni ART spiral splendour and Schwarzkopf Taft curl mouse. Hair stayed curly for good 2-3 days, but looked and felt dry.  

I‚Äôm trying different products and used Toni and guy wave memorising balm and Toni and guy creative stick it up gum and felt my hair curls didn‚Äôt stay up as much as they used to. 

This wash day, I used muk extra hold curl amplifier, toni and guy stick it up gum and Schwarzkopf Taft curl mouse. Although my hair looks really shiny and not dry (like they used to before) now I feel my hair feels sticky, heavy and the curls died down sooner. 

Is it the Toni and guy stick it up gum? Too many products? Just want my curls to stay and not look so dry :("

goodnightmoira,sxgjtc,I have very similar hair! I‚Äôm just a few weeks into this myself but the Not Your Mother‚Äôs Curl Talk cream is my favorite styling product so far.

ikrakenmyselfup,sxgjtc,"Thoughts on Not Your Mothers products? Beginners advice please!&&&&&&Thank you! That‚Äôs good advice. Makes sense to start cheap before investing in a bunch of stuff that might not work!&&&Thank you very much!&&&I am just starting my ""curly hair journey"". I have been experimenting with some different styling techniques to bring out my natural curls. I don't have much of a routine YET, but here's what I do currently:

Shampoo/conditioner is Joico Kpak reconstruct. I wash every other day to every 2 days ago. I'm in the market for some products from the holy grail list, but need help deciding what to get.

In these pictures I had brushed while it was wet with the wet brush and then scrunched it with some gel. I then tried plopping for a half hour. It was still soaked. I waited another hour or so and it was still wet, so then I let it air dry. I've made progress, but as you cans see in the pictures, the results have not been great! Whenever I use gel or mouse, it looks like I don't even have anything in my hair once it dries and it gets frizzy. Maybe I'm not using enough? I'm using a blob about the size of a half dollar, maybe a bit more. 

Here is what I'd like to know:

1. What is my hair type? I was thinking 2a? 2b?
2. I want to switch over to the products recommended in the holy grail list. I am looking particularly at the Not Your Mother's Curl Talk products. Just wondering if this is a good start, or if anyone with similar hair types had good/bad experiences?
3. I just don't know where to start! There's so many good recommendations in this sub, but I'm having a tough time picking the right products and routine.
4. Do I have the type of hair that would benefit from styling with a dryer/diffuser? Plop? Pineapple?

Other info:

\-My hair has been bleached/lightened. I had a lot of blonde in it, but have since had it colored back to my natural.

\-Growing up, my hair was always VERY thick, but it has thinned significantly over the last few years (I'm in my early thirties). It's also going grey pretty quick, especially in the crown area.

\-My hair is typically pretty coarse, but my scalp/hair get greasy after a day of not washing.

\-I have layers, and the outer most layers seem have less texture then the underneath. Not super surprising, just putting it out there.

\-I'm also getting a haircut Friday. I am trying to grow out my length, but am getting just a time. I'm open to haircut tips/suggestions!

I'll add more if I think of anything!

THANK YOU for any advice!!

TLDR; What products would work well for my hair? Not your mothers curl talk? Other suggestions? What is my hair type? Should I change up my haircut? Send help!&&&Thank you! I did do squish to condish this time, but it was the first time I tried it and I don‚Äôt think I did it long enough or used enough product. Definitely need practice!

vvictoriasauruss,sxgcoa,"How it started (2019) vs how it‚Äôs going (2022). All thanks to this sub!&&&&&&All I need is three bears and I‚Äôm all set! Thank you :)&&&Current Routine: wash 1-2x weekly with Shea Moisture shampoo and Tresemm√© Bontaique (the coconut one is silicone free!). After washing and detangling I apply one of either She Moisture Curl Gel Souffl√© of Herbal Essences Set Me Up gel  and‚Äîa recent addition thanks to a gift from my husband‚Äîthe Denman brush! I‚Äôve only used it once or twice but I‚Äôm loving the definition it gives me‚Ä¶ but also still trying to figure it out. 

This curly hair journey takes patience and a little bit of faith. It all comes in time. Even four years and it‚Äôs still a work in progress. I can‚Äôt even tell you how many compliments and questions I‚Äôve gotten about my hair since I started doing CG. Thank you all for sharing your routines and inspirational curls!&&&Trust the process! There‚Äôs almost 4 years between these pictures so it takes time which I think is important to emphasize. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to try new techniques and new products. I‚Äôve found YouTube and Instagram have also been great curly resources to see what other people are doing. I wouldn‚Äôt spend too much money on products either‚Äîall the stuff I use is from the drugstore or Walmart! Fancy products are all over the place but I‚Äôve personally found that cost effective options work great too. 

And the last piece of advice I have is don‚Äôt compare your curls to others! Your curls are uniquely yours and your journey to getting those luscious curly babies you want is uniquely yours. Products and techniques that works for other people might not work for you (hence why you gotta explore your options!) like for me, curl creams really make my hair greasy and limp‚Äîso I‚Äôve stuck to gels which I‚Äôve found helps my hair hold moisture and keep that definition I want.

Remember when you go online and see beautiful curls everywhere, people (me included) are sharing their hair on its best days‚Äîmy hair definitely does not always look like this. 

Best of luck on your journey, friend :)&&&Thank you so much!!&&&Thank you so much! They‚Äôre from Eye Buy Direct! I believe the style is called Peninsula.&&&Okay I‚Äôve also struggled with this! Getting curly volume at the top is hard! And mine when it‚Äôs freshly dried and I haven‚Äôt moved it at all isn‚Äôt super curly at the top either. 

How I go about parting changes day to day. I usually part down the middle which sounds like I could end up looking like a little lad (sometimes I do)‚Äîbut after my curls dry I can sort of flip my hair over and sort of gives me the curls at the root of that makes sense? Essentially I‚Äôm hiding the flat roots by flipping my hair over üòÇ&&&Thank you so much for your kind comment!!&&&Thank you!!! Every good hair day is a good day&&&OMG NO but now I feel like I NEED THAT. I didn‚Äôt  even know that was an option?! What the heck&&&Oh my goodness you are so kind! I so appreciate your comment. I am very proud of how far my hair has come this far!&&&I think I answered your first question in a previous comment!

I think if I did my current routine back then I would have definitely gotten better results but not what I have now. I think my hair is a lot healthier now since I‚Äôm not using any heat tools (aside from a drier every once in a while) and actually getting regular haircuts which I think makes a huge difference. 

I think cutting out sulfates for a long period has had a good impact on my current hair‚Äîjust removing those ingredients that will strip hair of its natural moisture has helped! 

So the long and short I think my old hair could have benefitted from my new routine but it probably wouldn‚Äôt be exactly the same. My hair has gone through many iterations before I got where I am today!&&&Thank you so much! You are so kind ü•∫&&&Thank you kindly! The purple-y red is from Aerie and the green guy is from Old Navy&&&Thank you so much for your kindness!

I hope you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a creep but I just looked at your most recent post on this sub and your hair is the most beautiful chocolate brown!

Your routine actually sounds great from your comment on that post. I live in a super cold climate too‚Äîtrust that after I go outside in the minus 20¬∞C that my hair also gets a little  dehydrated, less defined, and frizzy. The struggle is real and it is hard to avoid. Now this sounds simple but a game changer for me has been getting a misting spray bottle for my hair for those second and third day hair refreshes. I use it to mist my hair and give it that moisture it craves before applying product on non-wash days. Certainly helps me with the frizzies when the cold has wrecked my hair.&&&Of course everyone‚Äôs preferences are different and like their hair in different ways. That‚Äôs the beauty of curls‚Äîdifferent strokes for different folks! Thank you üòä&&&It is natural! I actually haven‚Äôt dyed my hair before!"

htraos,sxfga8,"Curly ends and getting a haircut&&&My hair is a mix of straight at the base, wavy in the middle, and curly at the ends. If I get a haircut to trim the ends, will the curls form again after a few days at most?"
Bratty-Switch2221,sxeukn,"Why would you want your 13/14 yr old to look ‚Äúmore mature‚Äù? Weird.

A reset cut does sound like a good idea since there‚Äôs so many different types of processing damage AND a bad devacut"
No-Collection-6982,sxeukn,I think your hair still beautiful
awcurlz,sxeukn,"It definitely sounds like you need a protein or bond repair treatment, something like olaplex or that curlsmith bond rehab treatment. If you want to try cheaper treatments, Sally beauty should have a few protein fillers or you can try any drugstore deep treatment that has protein in the name.

Ultimately you are still growing out chemical and heat damage. Your ends probably need high protein sting products and your roots may need something very different. Jeep in mind that hormones and environmental factors (weather, hard or soft water, etc) have huge impacts on hair texture as well."
i_eatbabies_64,sxeukn,"I hate my hair right now. (info in comments)&&&&&&So, where do I begin. I had luscious curls for the whole of my childhood (up until I started straightening aged 11). My routine (according to my mum) was to scrunch in some Boots Curl Creme and some John Frieda mousse and then I would air-dry and my curls would look fantastic, for reference they were 3B and mid-back length. Aged 10 (2018), for some reason I became obsessed with wearing my hair in this really high bun thing. Super tight, this also messed up my hairline but that's another topic. Anyways I would wash my hair and put it into a tight bun and I did this for about a year and a half. 

Once I turned 11 (2019), I started straightening my hair after getting pressured by some people (not gonna name and shame) and I ultimately got a Kerastraight treatment at an esteemed salon which claimed that the relaxer would wash out after 6 months (we all know that's a lie). So I straightened my hair for a year, then got another one of those relaxers in 2020. I then kept straightening my hair up until June 2021, when I went on holiday and wore my hair curly for the first time in 3 years, I fell in love with it and wanted to go back curly straight away (at this point it wasn't that damaged tbf) but my mum said that I looked more mature with straight hair.

 So I came back and I got an at-home relaxer (this messed up my hair) and finally in August 2021 I started wearing my hair curly again. It was a slow process but I got to grips with it and loved wearing my hair curly. As you can tell by the first photo that was my results 3 months into the CGM, stunning results and I beg for my hair to look like that again. For that washday I used Shea Moisture Curling Cream, I finger coiled and I used Eco Gel, then diffused on high heat and speed. After that, everything started going downhill, it went from 3/4 of my wash days turning out great to just 1/4 in November 2021. 

After that basically everything just failed I now have 0 wearable washdays and as you can tell by the second picture my curls are so soft and won't hold a shape. The flash shows up a lot of frizz, it actually isn't frizzy just really soft and not defined. My roots are growing out a completely different texture to the bottom and look so puffy and frizzy. I get no definition and it breaks my heart spending so much time on my hair just for it to look absolutely horrible.

 I had a horrible visit at a '5 star salon' which gave me a wonky Deva cut, forced me to buy ¬£200+ of products which didn't even work, and ridiculed my damage. I'm hating my hair right now. I just don't know what to do. My current routine is the same as before, but I added a deep conditioner into it. My roots are low porosity and my lengths are high porosity. 

Please help, do I need protein or K18 or Olaplex or do I just need to chop all my hair off and start again? I'm only 14 but I'm willing to take the risk if at least in the future I could have good hair.&&&How short would I have to go? My new growth is at about eyebrow level so far."
meg7997,sxeukn,Which shampoo and conditioners are you using? Are you still using the SM and Eco to style? When was your last trim? What's the weather like where you live? Do you have hard water? How often do you clarify?
katichichori,sxent3,"Feels like a similar problem to mine. Did you often use a straightener to really straighten out the front pieces? I used to do that, in order to make my hair look sleeker, especially the front ones. 

Ive started my curly hair journey recently as well and my front pieces still look comparatively  straighter than the rest. 

I think the key is patience. I wouldn‚Äôt want to cut my hair but I feel like from the heat damage, that would be the only solution. Instead I‚Äôm just doing my normal routine, and on the days when I feel my front pieces are looking quite straight again, I‚Äôll pin them on the sides. This makes them look like I still have good curly hair hahah. 

Hope this helps! I‚Äôm still a newbie so take this all with a grain of salt lol."
skoj8354,sxent3,"Different textures&&&I'm sorry if this has been asked before but I'm a newbie to Reddit and am ready to quit my cgh journey if I don't get help soon. 
My problem is the back of my hair is always 2b/2c while the front strands are more 1b/1c. I feel like I always look weird having the back of my hair wavy and the front practically straight. What can I do to fix the front strands?"
JSLP2019,sxeht8,"Curly hair products and acne-prone skin.&&&Hi, everyone! 

I am trying to leave my hair down more often. I love how my hair looks when I style with the right products. However, I‚Äôve come to find that the products that work well with my hair also cause me to break out (neck, chest, upper back). For instance, I recently started using got2b Be Twisted curly cream, which was a miracle for my hair‚Ä¶.until it led to breakouts. ü•≤ I‚Äôm in a dilemma between my curly hair needs and my sensitive skin. Does anyone have any recommendations for styling products that are better for acne prone skin?"

thecanarymode,sxeht8,Hey if you check out my profile comments I've shared what worked for me a couple times :)
Anxious-Custard6208,sxdy9o,I honestly just chopped it off and did an undercut. It grew back a lot healthier and doesn‚Äôt tangle anymore
akitty247,sxdy9o,"How to stop underside of hair from tangling&&&Hi all. 

Not sure if this can even be fixed. I have found the underside of my hair (the hair that basically touches my clothes when it‚Äôs down) get soooo dried out and tangled but the middle section of my curls and the top look okay. I think it‚Äôs because of the constant friction and contact with my clothes. Is there any way to prevent this atleast?"
macetheace4,sxdy9o,I‚Äôve had long curly hair my whole life and this has always happened to me. I think it‚Äôs just the heat/sweat off your body mixed with friction from your clothes. I‚Äôve never found a way to prevent it
