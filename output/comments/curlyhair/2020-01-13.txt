Shadowfox22187,er7v1a,Very beautiful
TrockyNocky,er7v1a,"Wow, gorgeous results!  Your hair is so shiny and healthy looking."
themoonsaidyes,er7v1a,Yooo your hair looks awesome!!
bewarethebaer,er7sww,You and your curls (but mainly you) are very pretty😱
funwith-mygun,er7sww,Seems I’ll fit right in with this sub&&&&&&Thank you!! Everyone says that I’m to pretty too be a guy but I enjoy my masculinity very much!&&&My routine is to wash with light shampoo and heavy conditioner both without sulfates! Keep my hair in a hood (or a Bennie preferably a hood) till dry then brush lightly it’s always poofy for the first day but by day 3 I got rocking head of curly hair! Btw I am a guy!( sometimes that gets confused)
Chloebird29,er7ayq,"Canola oil any good for hair??&&&Hey, I was going to try to make some diy deep conditioner with my regular conditioner mixed with extra virgin olive oil as I am all out of deep conditioner, however I don’t have any olive oil on me and there’s currently a state of emergency on where I live so no businesses are open and we cant drive on the roads anyways.  I have lots of canola oil on hand though but couldn’t find anything about that.  I have some coconut oil as well.  Would either of these be okay as a substitute?? TIA!! :)&&&Okay thank you so much!! I think I only have off brand miracle whip atm, I’m guessing that wouldn’t be as good as mayo right??&&&Thank you so much!! I did end up using both and it turned out great 😊😊"
The_Indian_Rose,er7ayq,"I'd add both as they are both good, thickening, strengthening hair oils. Canola oil contains lots of beneficial proteins. Here I wrote a few canola oil hair recipes: [https://www.theindianrose.com/how-to-use-canola-oil-for-hair-growth/](https://www.theindianrose.com/how-to-use-canola-oil-for-hair-growth/)"
bluepisces1980,er7ayq,"I’d choose coconut personally... also mayo or an egg can also work as a deep conditioner you can rinse out.

No state of emergency here but lotsa lotsa snow and bitter temps! Stay warm!"
bristly_hedgehog,er766o,"How do you handle your bangs? I’ve just started and my bangs are ridiculous looking. If I plop, they’re all gnarled and facing the wrong way. I try to dig them out of the plop so they just dry on my forehead, but then they’re flattened."
garneteosecos,er766o,"Mixing up the routine a bit. Night 1 results seem promising&&&&&&Current routine: 

1) Shampoo with ogx thick & full biotin and collagen shampoo

2) (New) Condition with Not Your mother's tahitian Gardenia flower & mango conditioner. Apply with praying hands and then Scrunch into hair. Let sit for 5-10 minutes and then detangle with wide tooth comb. Scrunch while rinsing with cool water
Scrunch out excess water. 

3) Add leave-in: it's a 10 miracle leave in plus keratin.

4) (New) Spray on not your mothers tahitian Gardenia flower & mango butter curl defining detangler. Comb through with wide tooth comb. 

5) (New) apply not your mothers curl talk sculpting gel with praying hands. Lightly scrunch. 

6) Plop in tshirt for 20ish minutes. 

7)Air dry for another 20-30 min.

8) (New) Diffuse excess water out, head flipped over until lightly damp - like 80-90% dry

9) Let air dry the rest of the way&&&My bangs dry the quickest so I'll comb my fingers through them as they dry. I do a mix of brushing my fingers downwards, upwards and side to side if that makes any sense?"
BookBiscuit,er75dz,"Stay strong, the transition phase is horrid. It was 5 weeks before I really got to grips with cgm and stopped feeling like a mess. Don't give up! ☺ 
I have learned from the great people on this sub that my fine hair is better without heavy creams. I find that leaving lots of conditioner in for too long makes it heavy (particularly coconut conditioner), I rinse it out now before I leave the shower. Gels and mousses seem to work best for my fine waves, some of the Shea moisture products were too thick and weighed down my hair."
garneteosecos,er75dz,Just out of curiousity: How frequently are you washing your hair?
jetpack_whit,er75dz,"I need help! In transformation stage and I have no clue what I’m doing! I think Im 2c/3a medium porosity, thin strands, between med/ low density. Whn I straitened my hair its soft and smooth but drying it naturally it feels like straw at the ends but it shows the signs of over moisture base off pics&&&&&&@katie no, the very first time and once after that due to lots of buildup. I wash with the co wash&&&I’ve been doing the curly girl method for the entire month of January and have tried multiple products so far. I’ve watched hundreds of YouTube’s and read multiple strands of blogs/ comments. This is how I (think) I know my hair type. From research I think I need protein AND moisture. Protein because I have thin strands (normally low in protein) and need moisture because of medium porosity and because my hair feels like straw... (but could be too much protein) see, I have no clue what I’m doing! 

Here are my products/ routine . 

-I clarified (the first time) my hair with Suave essentials daily clarifying shampoo.  &have used it one other time due to build up

-I wash my hair after with co-wash As I Am coconut co wash 

-I deep condition with Shea moisture reap treatment masque.leave 30 min

-I have used Shea moisture intense moisture leave in milk (but it was too heavy) and made my hair feel gunky/ gummy. 

- I am now using cream of nature with Argan oil from Morocco strength and shine leave in conditioner using praying hands

-LA looks extreme sports gel using praying hands

I’ve defused and I’ve air dried. 

Any advice would be appreciated!&&&Every 3 days I wash my hair. I just get too much buildup and my day 2 and 3 are in a pony tail cause it looks awful! (And feels awful!)"
katiepaulson,er75dz,Are you saying that you use the clarifying shampoo each time you wash your hair?
CryptidSamoyed,er6n9a,"Getting the hang of it!&&&&&&I cowash with VO5 right now followed by a palm full of IT Naturals 12 in 1 Leave in Treatment and Dirty by Lush. Went to cleansing washes biweekly cause Dirty has all natural waxes in it (ie Candelilla wax).

I try to cowash every other day when working cause I work at a factory and I get sweaty as hell lol

Working on growing my hair out too and getting it finally cut how I want as well."
sadandexhausted,er6n9a,So cute! Love your piercing too!
CommanderBly12925,er63u2,"My hairs a disaster, any tips are greatly appreciated&&&&&&My routine is loose and very amateurish, I just use Devacurl condishiner and shampoo in the shower and air dry, that’s about it, if I feeling funky I’ll use a Devacurl Gel after the shower and plop with gel then was after"
agentscully1013,er63u2,Try using a mask like Melt into Moisture or Heaven in Hair- both by Deva- once a week. Leave it on overnight.
bershellegray1,er63u2,Literally any leave in antifrizz cream
breanababe,er63u2,"Stop shampooing in every shower, try once or twice a week and make sure you have a sulfate free shampoo."
seubuceta,er63u2,You should read the curly girl book
Kitten7383,er63dc,Do your products contain protein?
missanticrowd,er63dc,"Probably too much protein, I’d try a protein free deep conditioner"
thatcakeismine,er63dc,"How do I avoid knots? Are my products failing me?&&&Hello curly friends!
I think my products may be failing me.

Routine : wash my hair every third day with serene scalp shampoo by a bit hippy ( low point). Then six condition and quiet to condish with Garnier hair foods ( papaya) and then use flax seed gel normally but I didn’t make a fresh batch this time so used herbal essence tousle me softly mousse. 
When I started out my curls were soft and I hardly had any knots. Now I feel like after my hair is almost dry, I can feel really bad knots that I can’t even get rid of my by simply running my hair through them. 
And I lose quite a lot of hair while I’m brushing my hair in the shower even though I use butt load of conditioner.

I used to use Goji berries hair foods and changed to papaya after my first tub was done. Is it that, that’s made a difference?

My hair is naturally wavy and the curly girl method has helped some of my waves turn to curls. I also think I have normal porosity but I got  some purple balayage done two months ago and since then my hair is drier than normal 
:(

Please help me figure out what changes I should make to my routine."
katiepaulson,er5w9y,"Check out the kids guide for product suggestions, but she can use ""adult"" products too. I would just stick with something very simple though and not a fancy routine!

Yes, you can co-wash! In fact it is best if she isn't washing her hair daily anyway. 

I highly suggest getting her a couple of satin pillow cases. They are easiest to find online in my experience (Amazon). It will help tremendously with morning tangles! Also, wearing braids to bed can help.

One more tip- never brush her hair when it is dry. Only when wet and when it has lots of conditioner in it!"
lablackey27,er5w9y,"Advice for my curly-haired child?&&&My 9 year old daughter has very curly hair.  We didn't know that for several years because I didn't let her grow her hair out because I was already chasing down the other daughter after baths to get her hair combed out.  Then she got a little older and wow she is curly.  We've had some trials, and have gotten to a decent place with a wet brush (the cut out kind that flexes) and Cantu coconut oil curling cream, but we have a long way to go.   I am trying to talk her into getting it cut to shoulder length while we work to get where she can handle post-shower comb out herself   It gives me no joy to cause her pain trying to get out the knots and rats that form on the back of her head overnight.  I feel terrible that she hates her beautiful hair.  I'm definitely going to read all the docs in the 'start here' post, but already I'm wondering (A) what's the best products for her age group, (B) can we try co-washing even she doesn't shower/bathe every day just yet?  Thank you in advance for your replies.  I've been showing her the folks in this sub and showing her that her curls can be wonderful."
MisterAmericana,er5rr7,"Not sure if you know him, but you kinda look like Joshua Weissman.

He's a chef that makes YouTube videos, by the way."
unarolaenusa,er5rr7," first of all, your hair looks great. I'm thinking maybe get a holding gel and layer it over the curl cream?  Don't touch it until it dries and then scrunch to break the cast."
yeah_its_slade,er5rr7,"Frizzed out need help&&&&&&Did not but I do now&&&What's a good gel? Rn I have all three of the Eco style gels&&&Routine: Cantu conditioner and shampoo then I apply Cantu moisturizing curl activator cream then let drip dry.

Edit: Spelling"
Axilllla,er5m2b,I want your hair!!
Lisaisaname,er5m2b,"Deep condition victory, best wash day yet!&&&&&&Clarify wash, deep condition with shower cap and heat for about 15 minutes, rinse, tiny amount of leave in and tiny amount of gel via plump method, diffuse. Voila! I never realized the dry winter weather was affecting my hair, my scalp is usually so greasy that I don't notice how parched my ends are. Now to maintain this delicate protein-moisture balance in my low porosity hair!&&&Thank you so much!!
I used Camille Rose algae renew deep conditioner, put my hair in a high bun under a shower cap, then stuck the end of my blow dryer up under the cap... The first attempt blew the cap off lol, but I figured out a good angle. I used the dryer only for about 3 minutes then just let my hair sit in the cap the rest of the time before rinsing.&&&Thank you so much!!! It's been an almost 2 year process of figuring out a routine that works!&&&Thank youuuuu!!!"
essywatwyn,er5m2b,"What products, please?"
niceandmeanboth,er5m2b,Thick and beautiful!
whatsdone_isdone,er5m2b,"You hair is gorgeous! Love your haircut 😍

What do you use to deep condition? And how do you keep heat on your hair while deep conditioning?"
penelopewonton,er5ltb,"Cute little springs coming out of my 🍍&&&&&&Hey yall! Decently new to CG. I've had shirley temple ringlets my whole life, and just recently started to embrace/love them.

Current routine: wash every 2 or 3 days with head and shoulders shampoo, condition with one of three things depending on what my hair needs (head and shoulders conditioner, herbal essences hello moisture conditioner. Aussie 3 min miracle deep conditioner). I workout quite alot, and if my hair gets very sweaty on a non wash day, I will co wash with the head and shoulders conditioner. I s2c, scrunch out extra water with a t shirt, get out of the shower, flip upside down and brush with the goody straight talk brush (similar to denman). Apply a few globs of LA looks blue gel with praying hands, brush it through, then scrunch it just a little, and then plop for anywhere from 10 to 30 mins with an evolve head wrap. Then diffuse (sometimes) and once dry, scrunch out the crunch. I sleep on satin pillowcase and pineapple at night with satin scrunchies! 😇"
delkattty4193,er53zk,"Curl cream suggestions&&&I'm currently using the beginner routine and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for creams that work well with Tresemme Botanique and the LA looks sport gel. Would like to get more definition and also use it during refresh routine.&&&Current routine:

* Co-wash with Tresemme Botanique
* Condition with same conditioner
* Detangle with fingers, then comb conditioner through to form clumps and S2C
* Apply palmful of gel, scrunch in
* Plop for 5 minutes to get dressed*
* Apply another quarter-sized dollop of gel, open-palm scrunch (no squeezing)*
* Clip roots, air dry until 85-90% dry*
* Diffuse 15-20 minutes*
