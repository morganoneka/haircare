I found one in the city on google, but all the clients are black. Would it be acceptable/ appropriate for me to try to make an appointment there?

WeAreStarless,prki16,">how to get my hair like this?

that really depends on where you're coming from; it's impossible to advise you without knowing what your hair is like. however, keep in mind that your curl type cannot be changed, so if your curl type is different than this person's, there is nothing you can do with products and technique to ""achieve"" this curl type"

Haven,prkbs3,"We have the same hair!  I never thought I would see someone else with my same curl pattern, as well as the soft baby fine texture!  I can never seem to get mine past my shoulders, as it ALWAYS ends up breaking so I just trim instead.  I think the only difference is my hair is more dirty blond/brown and sprinkled with silver now :)  I'm going to give your routine a try, thank you!"

Ghostytoast90,prk6gx,Have you tried using protein building products? I do a protein hair mask every month or so. Too much moisture can cause it to be too soft.
Pineapples_29,prk6gx,"Products best for 2C-3A hair???&&&My hair has been a struggle forever. Lately I‚Äôve been trying to wear it down instead of tying it up all the time and I‚Äôm having huge issues. 
I‚Äôve tried everything it seems. Twisting it before bed, plopping, letting it dry naturally, defusing, braiding it and letting it dry that way.. and a butt load of products. After a couple hours it looks the same. Undefined, frizzy and all stretched out and poofy. I have nice curls directly after they dry but then they just go POOF. I‚Äôve tried gel, mousse, cream, mixtures of those. And I moisturize and use hair oils too. I‚Äôve been doing the LOC method for years and I still feel like my hair just doesn‚Äôt stay very defined like pictures I see of other curly girls and guys on here. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I‚Äôm even a hairdresser!!! Lol&&&Well I would take little gobs of it and section out my hair. And then smooth it over the wet sections trying my best to comb it through with my fingers. Then I would encourage clumping by squishing and scrunching and then just leave it alone and let it dry. It would look good when it was still damp and then POOF. Probably not enough gel&&&I have a protein mask I use about once a month as well. I do notice my curls really bounce after that but after a day or so they just kinda go back to meh."
WeAreStarless,prk6gx,how much gel were you using? i found that my hair needs so much more gel than i'd think it would

1. LUS brand shampoo in Curly
2. LUS brand conditioner in Curly (leave for a few minutes while I soap him up).
3. Towel dry a little, then apply LUS brand all-in-one in Curly all over his hair while I brush all the tangles out. I add a smidge of it on the ends when I‚Äôm done.

Jaded-Ride7607,prj03f,"Any amazing products that thicken fine hair?&&&Idk if any yall have tried a egg or onion juice hair mask ( i know)  but the results are amazing! Thick, soft, and shiny but only lasts like a day or two. But im looking for products that replicate that thick, soft, shiny. I have fine hair with a oily scalp and dry hair. Everytime i use a luxurious conditioner my hair gets disgustingly over moist. Flat and all. I usually fix this by using head and shoulders shampoo everyday ( i know, not the best shampoo but its been working for NOW).

Im looking to thicken my hair while also not over moisturizing it. My best bet are the egg and onion juice hair masks."
WeAreStarless,prj03f,"you can't thicken hair. your strand thickness is determined by your genetics, and you can't change the way it grows out of your hair follicle in your scalp. you can apply things on top of it that maybe makes it feel thicker (like the egg or onion juice hair mask), but unfortunately, there's nothing you can do to actually make the strand itself thicker"

asoboyo,prijjc,Hair gets dry while styling&&&
badgalneyney,prijjc,"I would try searching on YouTube for black/mixed folks getting haircuts in Japan to try to find a stylist there. And to see what curly hair friendly styling products they‚Äôre using over there.&&&Some links:

Haircut: https://youtu.be/9wAack9AmX4

froggybirch,prijjc,"I hate to break it to you but it looks like your half of your hair is extremely damaged and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much you can do about that except for cutting it off and starting anew. You can tell that your healthier hair ends where it starts going straight.

I would recommend going to find a stylist that knows how to handle curly hair and going in for a big chop if you want your hair to be as healthy as can be."
skelevesence,prihsp,"Can I cowash more often than shampoo?&&&My current schedule has been shampooing once a week, detangling, styling, etc and then about 2x in between shampoos I cowash if my hair looks like it's getting a little meh and greasy and might need a little pick me up. It really makes my hair feel clean (not in the way shampoo does, which is why I could never ditch shampoo, but good enough!) 

However, is cowashing 2x a week just as bad as shampooing too much? Or am I in the clear?"
Groundbreaking_Tea_3,pri4n0,"Dyed hair, now have damaged my curls&&&I say curls but its actually around 2B wave pattern. Its not super curly but i love my waves especially since my hair is short they really curl.

But i box dyed my hair (yes i know thats bad but my friend dyes his hair a lot so knows how to do it in such a way that my hair doesn‚Äôt get fried) and now my waves have kind of disappeared as i know they are dried out and is just now kind of frizzy.

I‚Äôve never had this problem before as i never dye my hair but lately i have had a lot of strands turn chock white and im 25 so i was getting self conscious of the greys and my hairs dark so everyone could see it and people were commenting on it, so they had to go.

How do i fix this dryness? What are the best products (that are natural ingredients) to help put the moisture back in? Ive tried coconut oil but o must not be doing it correctly as its done nothing to help.

Hair care routines and products welcome, i‚Äôll take any advice (i have googled but theres so many different products id rather actually get the review of said products from someone who actually uses it and not a blog or something as for all i know, they got paid to say it)"
OutlandishnessFew424,pri4n0,Id try maybe getting a trim and deep conditioning. Olaplaex can help with some of the damage of dyeing your hair. Really though no matter how it‚Äôs done box dye is going to damage your hair.
WeAreStarless,pri4n0,"i don't have any advice, but

>but my friend dyes his hair a lot so knows how to do it in such a way that my hair doesn‚Äôt get fried

unfortunately, whether your hair gets fried or not doesn't really have an awful lot to do with the technique. box dye fries your hair because it contains ingredients like ammonia and hydrogen peroxide, which strip your hair to lift the colour"
l_a_e_n,pri4n0,"Hi, unfortunately I do not have any advice on how to get your curls back.
I would like to weigh in on the self conscious part about the greying though. I see a lot of people struggling with it, people of all ages really. Apparently it does not get easier when you 'only' start greying at 60. Who knew.
And honestly I'd love to somehow give you and everyone else who struggles the power to embrace their grey hairs. They are lovely! I don't know anyone who looks bad or particularly old with them. You know, you have a young looking face still if the aging aspect really bothers you. But even then I feel like we should embrace the aging as well. Every year we age we get closer to another experience we don't even know about yet.

So to sum it up, I guess just be you, because that's the most beautiful."
