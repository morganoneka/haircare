ChauntyRu,hhsvdv,The most beautiful ringlets and color!! Love!
StarsDownLow,hhsvdv,"Quickly put my hair in a ponytail this morning after my shower. Before bed I took it down and had no clue it had air dried so nice! This may have to be my new method&&&&&&Thank you:) and I definitely have! I tried being really strict about silicones and such for a while but I've slowly fallen out of the routine. I do normally try to plop my hair cause I like taking showers at night but I may have to switch to morning washes cause it really air dried much better than it ever has overnight!&&&I don't have much of a routine, I wash and condition maybe once a week or so with Pantene or sometimes Tressemme. And this time I applied some Tressemme flawless curls moose and just put it up in a ponytail all day. Normally air drying makes my hair super frizzy because it rubs against my shirt and back. But I guess the high ponytail helped!"
aerosmithangel,hhsvdv,OMG. Your hair is beautiful!!
rosielombo00,hhsvdv,Omg your hair is beautiful ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
square_pulse,hhsvdv,Beautiful hair. I am obsessed. You have a big pretty and awesome mane going on there! Like a lioness ‚ô•Ô∏è I guess you‚Äôve probably stumbled across the Curly Girl Method already ;)
memorises03,hhso2a,"Just washed and conditioned my hair and I'm feeling my curls!&&&&&&Routine

1) washed hair with shampoo and tea tree oil and use a scalp scrub

2) conditioned with Pantene curl perfection 

3) dried hair with an old high school t-shirt (GO ROUGHRIDERS!) 

4) brushed out hair

5) Cantu for the leave-in conditioner"
Chappedstick,hhsjb3,"When I first started, I loaded up on a bunch of moisturizing products because my hair was absolutely parched. After a while I started losing my curl definition again- my hair was so overmoisturized, it couldn't hold the pattern anymore! I don't know much about the love and beauty products, but maybe you're not getting enough protein?
Maybe try an apple cider vinegar clarifying rinse so it doesn't strip the color, and a rice water rinse or some type of protein product? I like Shea's manuka honey and yogurt mask personally- it really helped me."
literalbarofsoap,hhsjb3,here‚Äôs my first day curly girl (left) vs one month (right) i feel like my progress has gone backwards?&&&&&&the thing is i color my hair so i don‚Äôt want all the color to be stripped out :(&&&routine: wash with love beauty and planet 2-3 times a week. love beauty and planet conditioner and kinky curly knot today leave in. i do prayer method curl junkie curls in a bottle and then prayer method garnier curl control gel. plop for 1 hour and let air dry
xoxoabir,hhsjb3,I think you might need to clarify. It could be product buildup?
Poppybiscuit,hhshsr,"Anyone know the science of the pros/cons for flaxseed gel?&&&I've been seeing a lot of victory posts here and YouTube videos touting the miracle of flaxseed gel. Looks great, I'd love to try it, and I happen to have a ton of flaxseed in my cupboard right now! 

However, I can't find any legit, science oriented sources that talk about it, only YouTube videos, blogs, and anecdotal posts. We all know (I hope!) that just because something is natural doesn't mean it's safe or will do what you want, particularly in the long term, and when things like this get traction they can take off regardless of whether they're actually a good idea. Anyone remember the trend of using [yeast infection cream](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/monistat-hair-growth_b_3383192) on the scalp? Or [citrus oils](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/beauty/a25890566/essential-oils-all-natural-but-are-they-actually-good-for-your-skin/) on the skin? Or, that one brand we've all at least thought about trying that's now [being sued for hair loss](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/15/806366035/devacurl-faces-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-hair-loss)? Flaxseed certainly seems safe. I sprinkle it on my cereal and I've been considering adding a bit to my old lady Saint Bernard's food (once I talk to her vet), whose beautiful fur is starting to show her age. It does contain cyanide, but most sources I found state it's safe to consume even in large amounts, and boiling (as you would to make the gel) [removes measurable amounts of cyanide](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7589716/). 

Like all of you I only want to use things that I feel reasonably confident aren't going to ultimately fry my hair, make it fall out, or change its color, like rosemary (darkens), or lemon (lightens). I'm not a true curly girl, my hair is barely wavy, but I've been growing it out for years after multiple mishaps and cavalier, idiotic experiments courtesy of internet trends. 

So, does anyone have good sources, knowledge of the science, or even anecdotal, but long-term results (good, neutral, or bad) they want to share? I'd appreciate it, and I think others would too! Thank you!&&&Perfect, thanks!

Edit: that guy is indeed [legit](https://www.iahrs.org/hair-transplant/Sanusi-Umar). Thanks again, this is exactly what I was looking for."
ktothebo,hhshsr,"This isn't science, but anectdotally, I've been making my own flaxseed gel for 3 years and my hair is healthy, moisturized, shiny, curlier than ever and the only hair color change is that I'm going grey, which I was anyway. It's also hypoallergenic, unless you're allergic to flaxseeds, I suppose."
thegreypoet,hhshsr,"The study linked on this page seems legit

https://ugro.com/a-research-perspective-on-flaxseed-oil-for-hair-loss/&&&Seems it provides essential fatty acids (omega 3 and 6) to the hair and a few other things."
Byegrrlbye,hhsgpp,"My hair is too short to pineapple well. I hate wraps and sleep on a satin pillow and Medusa clip my hair with small clips.

[Medusa clipping](https://youtu.be/Z79tECx920Q)"
ChicanaYChingona,hhsgpp,"Sleep on it??&&&Decided to chop off half my hair recently for the first time in a long time and I'm a little lost now. When my hair was longer and one length, I always did some version of a pineapple and wore a silk bonnet to preserve my curls overnight. Now my hair's a lot shorter (I cute about 7 and a half inches) and long-layered and I'm not sure what I can do to preserve my curls. The bottom layers and the back are too short to reach the top of my head and even what does reach is pulled tight that it just kills the curls. I have 2C to 3A curls and fine hair so my curls naturally loosen up as the days go by so I would prefer not speeding up that process by pulling them up into a ponytail. How do you guys and gals sleep on your curls?&&&Awesome! I've tried wrapping with a satin scarf to no avail but I'll try again using the methods in those videos üëç&&&Medusa clipping...sexy lol the lengths we're willing to go to keep our curls looking their best. Guess I'm officially going to have to look into getting a satin pillowcase. Any recommendations?"
aka-grey,hhsgpp,"Skip the pineapple completely! You can either:

1) Stuff your hair sans-pineapple into a bonnet
2) Sleep on a satin pillowcase
3) Tie it up with a satin scarf 

Here are some videos that might help you that I‚Äôve referenced for tying up hair with a scarf:

nk2199,hhsf3f,i have this same problem and have not been able to find a solution yet :(
reallyjustizzy,hhsf3f,"Widow‚Äôs peak hair is frizzing up and I can‚Äôt get it to curl right&&&So I have a moderately defined widow‚Äôs peak that has given me problem no matter how I‚Äôve done my hair over my life. Since doing my hair curly the hair in my widow‚Äôs peak is so dry and frizzy. I add extra leave in and gel and it just won‚Äôt clump and looks so frizzy while the rest of my hair looks great. I don‚Äôt know what to do other than taking a Bobby pin and pinning it behind my ear so it‚Äôs out of sight. 

Anyone else with a widow‚Äôs peak have this problem??"
female_rock,hhselg,"You could try applying your styling products on dripping wet hair, then scrunch and plop for about an hour&&&Maybe check the ingredients in your products with the app Think dirty shop clean. Some products (I know Pureology and Devacurl do) contain ingredients which make your hair beautiful on a short period of time but they can be quite damaging after a while. Shea Moisture is great though! Maybe your hair lacks moisture or protein! So you might want to try different hair masks to add these to your hair. Another tip I would have is to use gel and create a cast around your curls after applying your styling products. This really helps keep your hair moisturized while it dries and helps define your curls! When It is fully dry, you can simply scrunch out the crunch:) hope this helped a little!"
mustardlyy,hhselg,"I need help! My curls are stringy and not very defined or shiny. Regrowth from previous hair loss causes a ton of frizz that‚Äôs hard to control. I feel like my curls aren‚Äôt living up to their true potential but I can‚Äôt figure out what I‚Äôm doing wrong w/ my routine.&&&&&&You‚Äôre so right I haven‚Äôt even thought about protein treatments lol. What would you recommend?&&&Routine:

1. Wash with Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus curl & shine shampoo

2. Condition with Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus curl & shine conditioner

3. Squeeze most of the water out with a towel

4. Apply Not Your Mother‚Äôs curl talk defining cream

5. Let air dry the rest of the way

6. Between washes, I scrunch in some Paul Mitchell round trip liquid curl definer

7. Every few days, deep condition with Purology hydrate superfood treatment or Shea Moisture argan and raw shea deep treatment masque

My hair is a weird mix of different curl types but I‚Äôm pretty confident it‚Äôs *mostly* 2B. I‚Äôm fairly new to CG so any help is appreciated! I also recently purchased Shea Moisture manuka honey and yogurt leave-in conditioner to use after the next wash.&&&Wow I knew that about devacurl but not purology! I was using purology hydrate sheer shampoo and conditioner for about a year but switched because it didn‚Äôt seem to be working as well as it used to. Now I see why. I think my missing parts of the equation are gel and protein so that‚Äôs next on the list. Tysm for the advice! :‚Äô)"
tranquil_turtle,hhselg,You might be over moisturizing your hair. Try adding in a little protein to your routine to balance it out.
blckrainbow,hhs70v,"Had pin-straight hair till I was 13, cut it short and it grew back curly. The same thing could have happened to you, but the bleach fried it, so the curl pattern weakened."
foolishtactician,hhs70v,"Yes, any kind of chemical damage can loosen the curl pattern. Congratulations! You're a secret wavy."
soup--fiend,hhs70v,"Bleach makes hair straight??&&&Thanks to a combination of lots of bleach and dye and some short haircuts, currently my hair is both (mostly) unbleached and past my earlobes for the first time since I was 13 (I'm 19 now). I always thought I had straight hair and definitely did as a child, but now my hair seems wavy (2a probably)? But not all of it? So I did some research and cut out sulfates + silicones. I've been using shampoo less and less and adding conditioner back in (didn't use it bc I didn't need it for very short hair) and I think I'm going to try using gel. My hair has been getting a lot less greasy and looks much healthier and has more volume! I had long hair a couple years ago and it was very straight most days, but most of it had been bleached 1-3 times and it was absolutely fried. Is it possible that my hair became wavy during puberty but the bleach killed the texture? Any thoughts welcome!&&&Interesting!!&&&Makes sense!"
adade39,hhr3uw,"Still learning to tame the flow and boost my waves, but I've come a long way from straight but poofy&&&&&&Daily routine is- squish to condish with tresemme coconut and aloe vera conditioner, rinse out 80%, scrunch in la looks extreme sport gel mixed with a dollop of mop too curly hair custard. Squish squish. Squish out water so hair is wet but not dripping. Plop in a cotton t-shirt for 20 min or until I'm done with breakfast. Hover diffuse my roots, then diffuse the rest upside down scrunching the diffuser up towards my head. Stop diffusing when 75-80% dry (mostly because I'm board). Let air dry as I finish getting ready. Scrunch out the crunch, find a part of sorts, and go.  

About once a week I shampoo with Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus shampoo. And about once a month I was with a sulfate shampoo always followed by mop top deep conditioner. I'm loving the progress I've made, and am starting to see more and more definition in the bottom layers, around my neck (even some ringlets hiding down there)."
Flamingo-Dance,hhqvd4,"Help! Ends don‚Äôt curl!&&&i‚Äôm sorry i don‚Äôt have a picture, but i‚Äôm having an issue! lately, the bottom 2+ inches of my hair won‚Äôt curl. my last trim was about 6 weeks ago. 
current routine:
as i am coconut cowash, shea moisture coconut hibiscus conditioner
cantu coconut leave in, miss jessie‚Äôs multicultural curls both applied with prayer hands
eco styler gel scrunched in
i don‚Äôt currently plop or diffuse because i‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt work well for me.
i definitely don‚Äôt want to do a big chop because my hair grows insanely slow, like only 6 inches in 18 months. 
any tips? thanks in advance!&&&in january i did a keratin treatment and straightened it once a week, it‚Äôs very cold where i live in the winter so it‚Äôs hard to have wet hair outside!! i think you‚Äôre right, i just don‚Äôt want to cut anything off"
WeAreStarless,hhqvd4,"did you used to damage your hair? if so, those remaining two inches are still damage, and they probably need to be cut off as well"
InterestingAnything3,hhqqk3,What is your current routine?
piccolive,hhqqk3,"Would anyone know my curl type? I def have some curls around my face and underneath but it‚Äôs straight on top which is a hassle. and if anyone has any product suggestions for the top to curl and reduce the frizz I would be ever so gratefulüíï&&&&&&I‚Äôve actually been straightening my whole life and I didn‚Äôt really start wearing my hair like this ‚Äúout‚Äù I guess until a couple of months ago.

happiestmo,hhqhc1,"my hair growth journey :3&&&&&&haha thank you :)) that's so sweet&&&not to be egotistical, but I agree :3 I have always wanted to have long hair :)&&&first pic is from December 2018, the second is September 2019 and the third is from today, June 2020! :) i started off as no poo and wanted to grow my hair, and i have never cut it :D it was quite straight for a long time, or maybe like wavy? but yeah then i started washing my hair again, and it's beautifully curly :) 

My routine : Reset wash with Andrelon Classic Iedere Dag Voor Ieder Haartype Shampoo (currently in the Netherlands, hence why in Dutch). Condition with Neutral Sensitive Skin Conditioner, finger detangle in shower and scrunching. Applied homemade flax seed gel mixed with olive and peppermint oil to dripping wet hair in praying hands motion, scrunched some more. Plopped hair in a t-shirt for around 25 minutes. Let air dry for 5 hours before scrunching out the crunch.

My night routine was simply doing a pineapple bun, and wrapping my hair in a silk scarf. I got the silk scarf I think from a present my ex gave me a while back, no idea where they got it from, and it has no label, but glad it came to use :). I followed the instructions on this video: ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXvD3XQyuDo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXvD3XQyuDo)). Hope this helps someone :)"

HollsoftheWest,hhqeuc,"Day 3 camping curls!&&&&&&Co-wash with Shea Moisture, then use the styling milk. Air dry all the way. For keeping it out of my face while backpacking/adventuring I tie back it into three messy buns mohawk style using soft scrunchies. I sleep with a jersey buff around my hair.

oleblueeyes75,hhq9r3,"Moisture, moisture, moisture. Reduce the number of times she shampoos and get a really good shampoo for when she does. Detangle in the shower with fingers only. A good haircut to keep the length and accentuate the curl.

EducatedHangman,hhq43m,Coconut oil or avocado oil is great too. I use the aussie miracle curls Cowash and leave in conditioner. Then use hair pudding. Also Aussie brand.
crumbs2k12,hhq43m,"What's a good replacement for shea moisture?&&&I was reading a post from a year or so ago and it was saying that shea moisture products make your hair weighed down and heavy and I've been having those issues recently, when I first started with them my hair was shorter but now it's getting longer and heavier and the shampoo causing it to be weighed down even more isn't helping, any other brands I should try?

I have thick wavy hair, I'm 19 male if that matters at all"
