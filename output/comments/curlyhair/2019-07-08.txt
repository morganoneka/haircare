9BadWolf9,cdcg26,Country? What products have you tried? I'm assuming you are talking about CGM products so have you checked the respective HG products wiki?
arrowcity,cdcg26,"Frizzy and oily hair in humid weather&&&Hi all, I am in the hunt for a new hair care routine. I have curly, thick hair (3A-3B type curls) but I have issues with humidity and frizz. What are some good products (shampoo/conditioner/hair creams) to tame the frizz down with swampy temperatures.&&&I have checked the wiki but I just wanted to know what people prefer the most? I am new to the CGM method so I have not tried anything yet. I usually shampoo and condition 2-3 times a week because I sweat a lot and the humidity is horrible"
9BadWolf9,cdc5m0,Contact their support. Tell them where you got it as well so that they can verify the re-seller.
Saveremreve,cdc5m0,"Shea Moisture Packaging Spelling Error?&&&&&&This is a request for comment, I purchased this Shea Moisture product from CVS in Baltimore MD but just noticed the spelling error. I haven’t been able to find this exact product yet in Los Angeles to confirm. Did they really release a product with “streGthen” instead of “Strengthen”? Is this a knock off?

Also - what does “anti-reversion” mean? Isn’t “reversion” putting something back to its original state? Don’t you want to revert your hair to its original form?"
WeAreStarless,cdc5m0,i googled that product and i think [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0272/6611/products/JBCO_Edge_732354b6-035b-4fc7-a78a-6ce91b20b205_grande.jpg?v=1506890151) is what it's supposed to look like. it's a bit hard to read the lid but it does look different. yours doesn't seem quite right!
asinglepeanut,cdc5m0,"This seems suspect to me. If I were you, I would contact their Customer Service. There’s probably a phone number on the container or you can go online and find an email."
drift_off,cdc5m0,Ehhh some places are sketchy in Baltimore. I haven't seen this product in stores (I'm about 15 mins from the city) but honestly I might email or tweet the company and ask. I found this product on Target's website and it looks like it's spelled correctly on the label.

twixe,cdc5m0,"Anti-reversion means that if you're using this on a blowout or some other stretched style it won't cause your hair to curl back up. If you've gone through the effort of straightening your hair, the last thing you want is for your edges to draw up prematurely."
9BadWolf9,cdbyq3,Use the leave in you mentioned in  your routine and finger curl it till the top. I have way shorter hair that naturally curl at ear length (and make me look like a cocker spaniel) and finger curling and air dry is what helped.
StrangePotion,cdbyq3,Perhaps layers would help if you’re not wanting to cut off too much length.
sirrahiously,cdbyq3,"Can I get the top half of my hair to curl as well?&&&&&&I just bought Deva Curl Low-Poo and Conditioner. This is after my first wash. I’ve been using it for about a month now but the top half of my curls are always flat and frizzy. I used a T-Shirt and scrunched a few times so it wasn’t dripping, but I feel like a shirt hasn’t been improving any frizz or making the top curly. 

I usually use the Garnier Fructis curl nourish leave in treatment while my hair is wet. (Hadn’t used it in this photo). And I use the John Frieda Frizz ease touch up cream to style after it dried. (also had not used it in this photo though). 

Products used: Deva Curl Low-Poo Original Shampoo and Conditioner
Method: T-Shirt dried - Finger curled/coiled it while wet&&&Seems like I’ll have to let go of a few inches after all then! I hate cutting it because it already loses some length when it curls and coils up. This picture makes it look longer than it is thanks to my extremely tall bf taking a photo so high up haha. 

I recently moved to a new state and looked on yelp at every salon to see if any of their websites had girls who specialized in curly hair and not a single salon had one! I was so surprised cause they have so many “Good at coloring!”, “The best at bleaching”, etc. I thought surely one girl will have hair like mine and know how to cut it! 

I had no clue devacurls website could help find one! I’ll check and cross my fingers there’s one near me!"
triscuitsngravy,cdbyq3,"Definitely recommend a haircut! My hair used to do the exact same thing back when I would wait 8-12 months between haircuts (went to a stylist at the time who didn’t know how to cut curly hair that well... so I tended to avoid getting haircuts). 

If you go on DevaCurl’s website you can find people that give DevaCuts near you. Definitely recommend since that has been a huge game-changer for my hair!!"
calkitty,cdbyi1,"Product submission: Purple conditioner

Product brand: Clairol Professional

Product name: Shimmer Lights Conditioner

Is it CG friendly?: Congrats, this product is CG Approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone! (parabens)

Is it cruelty-free? Unknown

Price range: $$

Ingredient list: Water/Eau, Glycol Stearate, Acetamide MEA, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Parfum/Fragrance, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Methylparaben, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Propylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Ext. Violet 2

Experience & Opinion: I actually use this as a co-wash - my hair is 2b/2c and heavily bleached. I scrub it into my roots and squish through the rest of my hair and leave on 3-5 minutes before washing out. I find it neither moisturizing nor stripping, and my hair feels soft-ish after use. I also own the shampoo (sulfates, very drying) which I use every 4 washes quickly to clarify."

\*\*Experience & opinion:\*\* The product replicates the hold of traditional hairsprays, worth the money by far as it really holds up to the elements and daily wear. It doesn’t get sticky, but if you use repeatedly over several days can make hair a little stiff. I use much less of this hair spray than I ever needed of traditional alcohol laden sprays. Smell is extremely light and fades quickly so good for those with sensitive noses. I’ve used the same bottle for over a year, as a little goes a long way."

\*\*Other info: you can also use this on your face :)

\*\*Experience & opinion:\*\*  Received a full-size today of this in in my Boxycharm Boxyluxe subscription.  I was so happy when I saw that it was a hair product that was actually cg approved!  I never expected that from a sub box.  I've been in need of an oil, but wasn't sure which one to try. I feel lucky that it showed up today!   I have it on my hair as I type this, I plan to let it soak all night before wash day tomorrow, will come back to update.  It has a nice ""nature-y"" smell, not strong at all.  I have dry scalp that's slightly itchy sometimes (used to be terrible before CG), so I'm hoping that this will heal that for me.  I also have friction damage on the back of my head due to a neck injury that I'm trying to fix (laid up for a long time, didn't realize it would happen, and honestly was in too much pain to care)  so, fingers crossed.   It's feeling really nice!  Not itching me at all!   Will come back with an update tomorrow (wash day).

&#x200B;

EDIT TO UPDATE:  washed out just fine, happy to see it's a lightweight oil, which is what my hair and scalp needs.  Definitely going to use this once, maybe twice a week at first since I have dryness.  Hope this does the trick.  Even at the price it is, this bottle should last quite a while."

**Experience & opinion**: (note, I do not STRICTLY follow CG)

* Provides great cast
* Useful for stubborn areas that don't want to stay curly all day
* Slight buildup requires once a week clarifying if used daily (assuming sulfates are not in your routine)
* Does contain propylene glycol, so it might not be ideal to those sensitive to humectants. (Daily use can cause a bit of dryness for me)
* Overall, I like this for refresh days right before clarifying or days when I have stubborn sections that don't want to play nice."

Experience and Opinion: I've been using it since before I shaved my head to grow my curls back. When my hair was shoulder length and severely damaged, I used it when my hair was wet and it was barely crunchy and looked even better on Day Two. Have loooooooots of volume to my already volumous hair lmao. Using it when my hair was only 2 inches long gave me Shirley Temple curls and now that it's grown about about 5 or 6 inches, it still gives my curls a lot of defenition and shine."

**Is it cruelty free?** (yes/no/unknown): Apparently not! :(

**Price range**: $ - $7.50-$11.50 (prior to tax & S&H) via online shopping search

Water (Aqua), Polyimide-1, Polyquaternium-11, Isobutane, Propane, PVP, Propylene Glycol, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Polysorbate 20, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Fragrance (Parfum).

**Other info**: Available at Ulta, CVS, Walgreens,  Walmart & Target (U.S.)

**Your hair info** (optional) (e.g. porosity, thickness, density): Medium porosity, 2c/3a, Leo density, stringy when wet & hard to form clumps, virgin hair, but has been heat treated in the past

**Experience & opinion**: (note, I typically follow strict CG, but got fed up and bit the bullet on the PEG silicone in here. It’s water soluble though!)

•    Forms lovely, fat clumps (on its own!) without weighing down hair

•	⁠Provides a medium cast that’s super easy to scrunch out, even on the thinnest clumps

•	⁠May require a light mousse on top for coarser hair to keep the curls from falling limp later in the day (I work 12-hour shifts, so YMMV).

•	May be used in place of a leave-in and/or cream ⁠due to highly moisturizing ingredients

•	⁠Contains PEG-12 Dimethicone, a water-soluble silicone that presumably rinses out, but weekly clarifying is recommended. This ingredient—along with the light-consistency argon oil—provide a lot of shine!

•	⁠Contains humectants other than glycerin, for those sensitive to frizz from that ingredient

I was fed up and about to quit on my hair, which was thin, stringy, and limp no matter what I put in it. I use this mousse as my ONLY product, and it’s my absolute holy grail!! If you’ve tried everything else, try this product. It’s amazing!! It’s also the only OGX mousse that’s CG approved."

otter_annihilation,cdbxjn,"Also available at Kroger (at least in my area). I definitely agree with it being good for refresh days. I also find it provides good humidity control, so I do tend to use it daily in the summer. I haven't noticed a buildup until I also started using it to dry refresh between wash days. That buildup goes away easily with cg friendly shampoos, in my experience (I use SheaMoisture Curl and Shine)."
roseofjuly,cdbxjn," **Product brand:** Moroccanoil

**Product name:** Curl Control Mousse

**Is it CG friendly?** (copy/paste answer from IsItCG): ""Congrats, this product is CG-approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone!""

The ingredients that caused concern were Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol (it's a protein, so it just warned that these strengthen your hair but also could cause dryness and breakage if overused) and the Polyquaternium-11 (a polymer conditioner it warned could build up on your hair. Oddly enough, the applet wasn't concerned about the two other polyquarterniums in the mousse.)

 I'll also warn and say that the IsItCG applet didn't recognize most of the ingredients I entered and just marked them as ""probably OK.""

**Is it cruelty free?** Yes

**Price range:** $$$ ($23 for a 5-oz bottle. Personally, I think that's very expensive given the amount you get.)

**Ingredient list:**  

Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Polysorbate 20, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyquaternium-72, Parfum/Fragrance, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Polyquaternium-11, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Chlorphenesin, Polyquaternium-70, Caprylyl Glycol.

**Other info:**

**Your hair info (optional)** (e.g. porosity, thickness, density): Fine, thick, afro-textured hair that forms small ringlets (commonly called ""type 4a/4b"", I believe). I think I have normal porosity hair.

**Experience & opinion:** I use this mousse for wash n' gos; I don't get the most super-defined curls, but that's usually not what I'm looking for with a wng anyway. My curls are pretty well defined, voluminous, soft to the touch (especially after a day) and moisturized. I will say I'm usually left with a small bit of frizz, but that could've been my hair dryer - I recently got a Dyson supersonic dryer and I had very little to no frizz with that."

**Other information**
Product description from the website: When you want styles that last for days, I’m the secret. I’m the Avocado & Argan Curl Gel. Many gels can leave hair crunchy and dry, but I'm infused with a unique blend of oils to keep hair touchably soft! Coconut, avocado, and argan oils are paired with natural, gentle Vitamin E and A to ensure your more beautiful results. Now you can lock in the style you worked for without sacrificing softness or shine.

All of Urban Hydration's products don't have parabens, synthetics, polybeads, and toxic chemicals. They are also all gluten-free and vegan-friendly.

**Experience & opinion**
This is the only gel I use in my hair because it's absolutely amazing. Before this gel I hated the thought of gel in my hair due to it making my hair crunchy, but this gel is different. It holds a great cast until broken and then the hold is amazing. It's holds but is still lightweight and extremely moisturizing. P.S. sometimes you can find it at TJmaxx"

\*\*Product brand:\*\*  Curly Hair Solutions

\*\*Product name:\*\* Curl Keeper Original 

\*\*Is it CG friendly? (copy/paste answer from IsItCG):\*\* Congrats, this product is CG Approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone! (Polyquats)  

\*\*Is it cruelty free? (yes/no/unknown):\*\* It's listed in the cruelty free section on the [naturallycurly.com](https://naturallycurly.com) shop - I think yes

\*\*Price range:\*\* $$

\*\*Ingredient list:\*\* Aqua/Water/Eau, VP/VA Copolymer, Propylene glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Glycerin, DMDM Hydantoin, Oleth-20, Parfum, Polyquaternium-10, Amylcinnamyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool

 \*\*Other info:\*\*  

\*\*Your hair info (optional) (e.g. porosity, thickness, density):\*\* high porosity, thin, low density, seb derm  

\*\*Experience & opinion:\*\* The formula is really thin, so it's much easier to distribute it evenly if you like to use prayer hands or finger comb to distribute your gel - doesn't work well with scrunching. I don't get a hard cast from it and I'd say it's soft to medium hold. Very easy to refresh with water for several days after wash day. My hair seems to dry faster than usual with this gel, which is a nice feature when I have to wash my hair in the morning before work, but it does seem to be drying in general and doesn't leave my hair looking very shiny or moisturized, even if I layer a good moisturizing cream underneath it. Nice to have on hand when I'm in a hurry, but not a holy grail for me."

**Product name:** Orange Marmalade

**Is it CG friendly?:**  Probably OK. These ingredients are either OK to use or weren't an exact match for those to avoid.

**Is it cruelty-free?** Yes!

**Price Range:** $$-$$$$ depending on size purchased

**Ingredient List:**    Flaxseed extract, Agave nectar extract, Pectin, Aloe Vera juice, Marshmallow Root extract, Vitamin E, Xanthan Gum, Optiphen Plus, Sweet Orange Essential Oil. 

**Other Info:** Handmade by a small company in GA. Recommended to be refrigerated because of the all-natural ingredients.

**Your hair info:** I think 2C to 3A, but I do not really care. Shoulder-length, normal porosity (i think), and super fine.

**Experience:** My hair loves this when paired with a mousse. No flash drying, good hold even in GA humidity. I only need 3-4 pumps for my hair and it gives me longer lasting wash days when compared with most other gels. Gives me a pretty solid cast when applied to super wet hair but I have not had much luck with damp styling and this product together."

**Product name:** Curlsmith Curl Defining Styling Souffle

**Is it CG friendly?** Congrats, this product is CG Approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone! See below for a breakdown of the ingredients

**Is it cruelty free?** Yes  

**Price range:** $$$$  

**Ingredient list:**   Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Irish Moss (Chondrus Crispus), Sorbitol, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Fragrance (Parfum), Babassu Oil Polyglyceryl-4 Esters, Linum Usitatissimum (Flax) Seed Extract, Carapa Guaianensis (Andiroba) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Selaginella Lepidophylla (Resurrection Flower) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Leaf Extract, Piper Nigrum (Black Pepper) Seed Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Limonene, Linalool. 

**My hair info:** thick and wavy 2bish, some heat and color damage and tendency to frizz

**Experience & opinion:** This was recommended to me by my stylist. I was hesitant to try it due to its price ($27 for 8oz at Ulta). However I ended up really liking it. It's got a weird texture, a little lumpy, but it kind of melts on  your hands when you rub it between them. It produced only a light cast for me, and didn't weigh my hair down. I'm trying to find a less expensive ""dupe,"" but so far I haven't found anything that works as well (no, not LA Looks either)."

Product name: **Tress Effects + VitalCurl Styling Gel**

Is it CG friendly?: **Congrats, this product is CG Approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone!** 

Is it cruelty free? (yes/no/unknown): **Yes!** 

Price range: **$26 (8oz) - $75 (33.8oz)**

Your hair info (optional) (e.g. porosity, thickness, density): **Average-to-low porosity, thin, normal density, 2b-3a**

najevb2,cdbxfy,"Product submission:

**Product brand:** Kevin Murphy

**Product name:** SUPER.GOO

**Is it CG friendly? (copy/paste answer from IsItCG):** Congrats, this product is CG Approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone!

**Is it cruelty free? (yes/no/unknown):** Yes

**Price range:** \~$30 USD for 100g

**Ingredient list:** Water (Aqua) (Eau), Ceteareth-25, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Glycerin, Polyimide-1, Polyquaternium-55, Tocopherol, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Caffeine, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, PEG-12 Dimethicone,Oleth-3, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Fragrance (Parfum), Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Eugenol, Citronellol, Isoeugenol

**Other info:** Creating SUPER.GOO was all about creating something that provided me with thick, modern, chunky texture – I wanted more than a gel, something with a more modern feel that left the texture rough, yet gave a really strong hold. I also didn’t want crispy, crunch – I wanted moveable, modern chunky texture, which is the result you get from SUPER.GOO, an essential part of our STYLE/CONTROL regimen.

**Your hair info (optional) (e.g. porosity, thickness, density):** 3c, low porosity, black, medium thiccness, low density

**Experience & opinion**: My friend and I shared some products. When she first gave me this product, I was a bit disappointed because of the small amount she gave me. My mind changed when I opened the small container. This gel  stuck to my fingers like elmer’s glue like a type of slime. It was very interesting and really defined my curls without making my curls crunchy."
otter_annihilation,cdbxfy,"**Product brand:** As I Am

**Product name:** Curling Jelly

**Is it CG friendly?**: Congrats, this product is CG Approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone!

**Is it cruelty free?**: Yes (but not vegan)

**Price range:** $$

**Ingredient list:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Betaine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Erythorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Pectin, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum (Coumarin, Limonene), Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol

**Other info:**

From their website: *Define Your Curls. Shine Your Curls. Help Them Do What Nature Intended. Perfect for Wash & Go Styling. What a wonderful Curling Jelly for hi-definition coils and curls, with buoyancy and vibrancy! Whatever your hair length, your style will be distinctly beautiful and will hold its definition for days.*

*Benefits:*

* *Defines coils and curls*
* *Minimizes frizz*
* *Reduces shrinkage and enhances stretch*
* *Locks in precious moisture as you harmonize your coils*
* *Formulated with nature's best moisturizers and curl boosters*

**Your hair info:** Normal porosity, normal thickness, very fine, wavy (2b to 2c, typically, definitely not curly/kinky/coily)

**Experience & opinion:** I love this jelly! I use it because it gives great slip, shine, and definition, and it layers well under stronger-hold gels (e.g., LA Looks Sport). The website says this was specifically formulated for tightly coiled and curly hair, but it works well for my very fine, wavy hair. I’m currently putting it on top of the As I Am Leave-In Conditioner and Cantu Curl Activator, although it also works great without those. I think it provides a bit of hold and frizz protection too, but I’ve never used it without a stronger gel on top, so I can’t be sure. I love the “squishiness” it gives my wet hair. It feels like it does a great job holding moisture in while I’m in the shower, which makes it easier to squish and wet style (similar to the feel that Cantu Curl Activator gives). I’ve really only used it in hot/moderate weather, so I’m not sure what will happen as the dewpoints continue to drop, but I’m hoping it keeps working well for me, because it’s one of my faves!"

**Experience & opinion** A good strong hold gel that remains somewhat flexible.  It does not flake. Also, it mixes in my palm with liquid oils (avocado, olive) to form a cream-gel for when I need more moisture."

Product Name : Curl Quenching Conditioning Wash

Is It CG Friendly : CG approved

Is It Cruelty Free : Cruelty free AND Vegan

Price Range : $$$$

Ingredients List : Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Fragrance (Parfum), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Selaginella Lepidophylla (Resurrection Flower) Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Carapa Guaianensis (Andiroba) Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Leaf Extract, Piper Nigrum (Black Pepper) Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Linalool

Other Info : You can find it at Ulta Beauty.

Hair Info : I have low porosity, high density, 2c/3a hair

Eperience & Opinion : This has been a staple in my routine since I started my CG routine a year ago. It cleans the hair well, but allows the hair to stay super moisturized. It also gives a super sweet shine. My only con is that it's so expensive. But if you take advantage of Ultas jumbo sale, it will save you so much. I'm about half way through my first bottle from last fall. Highly recommend it."

Product: Cantu Natural Complete Conditioning CoWash

Is It CG Friendly? IsItCG says no, because of the castor oil; Curls it says yes it is. So... Maybe?

CF Status: Unknown

Price Range: $4.99 @ Target. $4.97 at Walmart.

INGREDIENTS: AQUA (WATER), STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, STEARALKONIUM CHLORIDE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), GLYCERIN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CETEARETH-20, CANOLA OIL, CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, POLYQUATERNIUM-7, POLYQUATERNIUM-10, POLYQUATERNIUM-11, RICINUS COMMUNIS (CASTOR) SEED OIL, CITRIC ACID, QUATERNIUM-75, TETRASODIUM EDTA, PANTHENOL, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM BENZOATE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, CARICA PAPAYA (PAPAYA) FRUIT EXTRACT, ANANAS SATIVUS (PINEAPPLE) FRUIT EXTRACT, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT, PERSEA GRATISSIMA (AVOCADO) OIL, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS (JOJOBA) SEED OIL, OLEA EUROPAEA (OLIVE) FRUIT OIL, MANGIFERA INDICA (MANGO) SEED BUTTER, ARGANIA SPINOSA (ARGAN) KERNEL OIL, MELIA AZADIRACHTA (NEEM) SEED OIL, DAUCUS CAROTA SATIVA (CARROT) SEED OIL, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA (MACADAMIA) SEED OIL, MANGIFERA INDICA (MANGO) SEED OIL, VITIS VINIFERA (GRAPE) SEED OIL, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) OIL, HYDROLYZED SILK, LONICERA CAPRIFOLIUM (HONEYSUCKLE) EXTRACT, MACROCYSTIS PYRIFERA (KELP) EXTRACT, SALVIA OFFICINALIS (SAGE) LEAF EXTRACT, VITIS VINIFERA (GRAPE) SEED EXTRACT, URTICA DIOICA (NETTLE) EXTRACT, SILK AMINO ACIDS, ALOE BARBADENSIS (ALOE) LEAF JUICE (DECOLORIZED), BENZYL BENZOATE.

Hair Info: Fine, possibly low porosity, hispanic/white curls. I believe I have what would be considered 3a-3b curls.

Experience: I discovered this stuff by accident because I wanted cheaper products. My hair loves this stuff, it is my go-to daily wash. I do have to cleanse my hair every morning, and this is moisturizing and gentle enough for the job. YMMV, but I also get less fallout in the shower when I use this, as opposed to other cleansing products."

Product: Coconut Shea Cleansing CoWash

Is it CG? It gets flagged on isitcg due to benzyl alcohol, but other sources consider that a CG approved, moisturizing alcohol. It’s the last ingredient so I would side with curlsbot over isitcg in calling this product CG.

Is it cruelty free? Yes

Price: $$

Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Butryospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Butylene Glycol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol Dibenzoate, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Parfum), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol

Experience: This is my HG! I have thin, low porosity hair and it leaves it nice and clean, which is a rarity for cowashes. It also has a ton of slip so my hair is soft and detangled after I use it."

Other info: Available in most grocery stores, drug stores, and dollar stores for $1 or less

Your hair info (optional) (e.g. porosity, thickness, density): 2b-3a, high porosity, low density  

Experience & opinion: This is the first-ever cowash that ever worked for me, and was a game-changer in terms of a successful CG routine. It's fantastic for people who are sensitive to hard water, as the disodium EDTA is a chelating agent. It's 88 cents at my grocery store, and I would happily pay $15 dollars for it because it works so well at cleansing my hair without drying it out."

redditorinalabama,cdbx6m,"I spend about 100-something dollars every like 6mo on two big ole bottles of Devacurl NoPoo Decadent. I have done this for the past three years. I cringe when I go to someone else’s house and don’t bring them with me and have to use their shampoo and conditioner. I save money by getting the huge bottles but they’re sooooo big it’s hard to travel with them. Nonetheless, this has been the best product for me. My hair is prone to matting and I frequently use the conditioner to “untangle” (if you can even call it tangle) But I also use Paul Mitchell’s Superskinny serum while it’s wet after I shower and it cuts dry time in half! I have a shit ton of hair and live in a humid climate so that’s still like 8 hours if I let it dry naturally) but I can’t imagine ever switching to anything else. Yes, occasionally I have to use a buildup buster. It took so long for me to find a product that “works” for me, I’d literally die if they stopped making it."

**Product name:** No Poo Decadence Zero Lather Ultra Moisturizing Milk Cleanser

**Is it CG friendly?** (copy/paste answer from IsItCG):  ""Congrats, this product is CG-approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone!""

I feel like that's an answer that would apply to virtually anything you put in there. There were specifically three ingredients of concern. The first was polyquarternium-7, a polymer that is used as a conditioning agent. CG says it may cause some build-up on fine, thin hair. The second two are humectants - glycerin and propylene glycol - which it says may be worse in hot, dry climates because they can draw moisture out of your hair.

I'll also warn and say that the IsItCG applet didn't recognize most of the ingredients I entered and just marked them as ""probably OK.""

**Is it cruelty free?** Yes

**Price range:** $$$ ($24 for a 12-oz bottle)

**Ingredient list:**  Water (Aqua, Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Behentrimonium Chloride, Laureth-4, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Propylene Glycol, Cyperus Esculentus Tuber Extract, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Melissa Officinalis Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum, Polyquaternium-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Fragrance (Parfum).  

**Other info:**

**Your hair info (optional)** (e.g. porosity, thickness, density): Fine, thick, afro-textured hair that forms small ringlets (commonly called ""type 4a/4b"", I believe). I think I have normal porosity hair.

**Experience & opinion:** I love this co-wash. I keep wanting to try a cheaper co-wash - most of my hair care I get at the drugstore - but I keep coming back to this, and the conditioner, because my hair loves it. It gets my hair clean without stripping, so my hair feels bouncy and moisturized. It also smells great!"

Product Name:  Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo

Is it CF friendly:  Is it CG?
Congrats, this product is CG Approved, but contains some ingredients that may not work for everyone!

See below for a breakdown of the ingredients

CG Approved with caution
Polyquats
These ingredients could cause build up on finer, thin hair
Polyquaternium-39

CG Approved with caution
Humectants
A humectant absorbs moisture and keeps a moisture balance in the hair and skin. Humectants will search for moisture in your own hair too. Therefore, in areas where it may be hot, but dry, these products may actually do more bad than good. In the right condition, humectants are materials used in products to moisturize dry or damaged hair.
Glycerin

CG Approved
Gentle Cleansers
These ingredients are gentle cleansers that you want to look for.
Cocamidopropyl Betaine

Probably OK
Remaining Ingredients
These ingredients are either OK to use, or weren't an exact match for those to avoid.
Water (Aqua
Eau)
Sodium Alpha Olefin (C14-16) Sulfonate
Acrylates Copolymer
Cocamide Dipa
Glycol Distearate
Steareth-4
Phenoxyethanol
Fragrance (Parfum)
PEG-150 Distearate

Is it Cruelty Free:  I cannot find that information specifically, but on their website it states, “Do you test products on animals?  We do not test our final products on animals, but we do however like to test on family and friends!”  If anyone has a definite answer, please reply.

Other Info:  I am a newbie who has only done the reset wash so far, so I haven’t used it yet.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Shea Moisture.  I have thick, wavy hair, so I wanted to opt for “low-poo” instead of “co-wash”.  Since my hair is thick, I’m not worried about the Polyquats warning.  Since I live in the FL humidity, I’m not worried about the Humectants warning.  I will comment with a review after I’ve used it a few times (although I am new to CG so I won’t really have anything to compare it to)."

minniesnowtah,cdbi3u,">Will that get better or do I just have to scrub better with conditioner next time?

Probably both! It depends a little on what you were using before and whether your scalp is very dry or not.

In the official CG book (the one by Lorraine Massey), she says the itching is from your scalp healing from past damage & dryness. I think that's partly true from experience, but it can also be from product left on your scalp. If it gets hard to deal with, it's totally ok to use a CG approved shampoo and wean yourself off of it (or not) as it gets better."

Warrior_of_Weekends,cdbd4b,I've heard that dandruff shampoo is supposed to help more so with flakes relating to oily scalp and bacteria buildup. The head and shoulders might be drying you out causing more flakes. You may want to try just getting a shampoo brush and really going to town before you shower and while you shampoo to get rid of some of the flakes along with a more moisturizing shampoo.
