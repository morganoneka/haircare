Shampoo: V05 Strawberries and Cream or Not Your Mothers Tahitian Gardenia Curl Defining Shampoo

Cowash: As I am Coconut Cowash

Conditioner: Tresemme Botanique 

Cream: Miss Jessie‚Äôs Multicultural Curls (this thing changed my life i swear) 

Gel: Not your Mothers Curl Talk Gel or ECO or LA Sport Gel (depending on which one is closest to me)

Shampoo once every 3-4 days, cowash and condition. Haven‚Äôt quite figured out S2C yet so I try to do it but pretty sure I‚Äôm doing it wrong. I know you should style when hair is soaking wet in shower but it always comes out bad when I do that so I wait for it to dry a tiny bit and then do it after I put clothes on. I spritz a little more water, brush Miss Jessie‚Äôs through my hair (in sections if i have time) and then glaze the gel over it. I don‚Äôt do it upside down but I tilt my head to the side and found that works better. Air dry always comes out best but if I don‚Äôt have time then I‚Äôll diffuse. 


The only products I was able to bring with my overseas are: 

Coconut Cowash
SMALL bottle of gel (barely 3oz) üò≠
SMALL bottle of shampoo üò©
Miss Jessie‚Äôs Curl Cream
My diffuser head (but no hairdryer, I have to go find one üò≠) 

I am in Morocco so a lot of the products I use at home aren‚Äôt available to purchase.

Lover6890947544,oihjsp,"I have similar curls! Walmart sells RenPure conditioner that has been fabulous for my hair and doesn‚Äôt break the bank‚Äîabout $8 for a very large bottle. 

A few other things that may help:

‚Ä¢Drop the shampoo. Seriously. This subreddit has lots of info about co-washing (just with conditioner). I‚Äôve been shampoo-free since 2008, and it‚Äôs been amazing for the health of my curls. 

‚Ä¢Dump the brush, especially on wet hair! Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb to comb through when wet, and then just let it be!

‚Ä¢LUS has a great curl serum (it‚Äôs their Step 3 product). That‚Äôs the only hair product I use‚Äîcontrols frizz and is amazing at defining the curls. It seems expensive at $18/bottle, but one bottle lasts me well over 6 months. Might be worth checking into!"

dannydevitoslegs,oihjsp,"Help with having my wavy hair turn back into my curly hair on a budget?&&&I have naturally curly hair. I'd describe it as a 2A right now with split and dead ends, but normally it's about 2C and sometimes 3A. I use a lot of cheap products because I'm a broke college student like Suave. All I use (right now) is TreSemme curly shampoo and Suave regular conditioner, and brush my hair in the shower. I brush my hair only when it's feeling very tangled and frizzy. I know some basic stuff like I should probably switch shampoos and conditioners, and give myself a trim, but does anyone have any advice for products for my hair type on a budget? Or just any advice you have for a similar scenario at all? I appreciate it in advance. üíñüíû&&&Thank you so much! :)

I was actually in a rush and wasn't able to look through the list, unfortunately, but for the ""gel"" I actually got a cream? I got g√∂t2b curl reviver cream, which is supposed to go on after washing my hair. I hope that'll work. I also saw on there I should start washing my hair with cooler water instead of super hot which I'll admit is a bad habit of mine.&&&Thank you so so so much!!!! :D
Unfortunately I couldn't find what you recommended (I was in a hurry and I was at Meijers, not Walmart) :(
I got something called ""Not Your Mother's"" deep conditioning curl masque, which I'll use instead of my Suave, and a g√∂t2b cream curl reviver! I'm going to put away my shampoo for a bit and, honestly without brushing my hair tangles SO easily. I might HAVE to brush it (it usually curls back up after rinsing it), but when it's dry I can just check for tangles and use my hands! Thank you so much again!!! :)&&&I got a deep conditioning curl masque from a brand called Not Your Mother's! Thank you!"
levatorescostarum,oihjsp,"It's so fascinating how people can have similar hair types and need completely different techniques! I'm a 2c/3a, and my curls need shampoo. Every wash - no cowashing or low-poo. In my experience dirt and buildup collects FAST on loose curls. Also tangles collect bigtime - my curls are curlier when I use a tangle teezer in the shower vs when I use fingers/a comb. Brushing dry hair will break it all off unfortunately. 

If you don't mind me asking, how long is your hair/what is its porosity? I have high porosity, course hair that's mid-back with a few shoulder length layers. I'm also fairly grubby so my hair gets dirty/knotted quickly lol"

BadAssPrincessAlanie,oifykn,"Needing advice. So I've always had 3b/3c curls, and once I first started using chemicals to go pink (Ion) my curls went flat. I use Overtone now but my curls haven't come back. I have not used bleach. more details in the comments.&&&&&&So, I have not used an actual brush on my hair in about 2 years until very recently (literally the last 3 days) I only have used the Denman brush for styling purposes. 

I used to use Curl Quench by Ouidad, the shampoo and conditioner, but now I use Its a 10 Shampoo and Conditioner for about 6 months. I condition every day and I only shampoo once a week unless needed (swimming, excess sweat, dirt, etc). 

I only put essential oils in my hair, Miss Jessie's Pillow Soff Curls, Miss Jessie's Sweetback, and/or Its a 10 Leave In Spray. Occasionally there is a sea salt spray I will use for styling. Very occasionally. 

The last month I have started using the Dyson hair dryer every other day on the lowest heat and lowest wind setting. I do a curl technique which is starting to bring the curl back at my scalp, just not my ends. I have only straightened my hair once in 6 to 8 months. 

Help?"
Fine-Profile-5769,oifykn,"Your curls look to be so similar to mine! I recently watched a video on YT by Manes by Mell titled ‚Äòcurly hair mistakes to avoid + tips for volume and definition‚Äô where she styles both sides of her hair differently. Lots of excellent tips there! I personally never diffuse (just can‚Äôt be bothered to stand there for that long haha and I‚Äôve never loved the result). I also don‚Äôt do her technique verbatim, like I don‚Äôt use any sort of brush with small sections. Because my hair is fine and thin I do focus any product at the ends and work it up towards roots (that way not much product is on my roots weighing my hair down). I tend to work in just 4 sections and after I‚Äôve applied product I sort of rake each section and let my hair part in all its tiny curls. I‚Äôd that makes sense?? My hair is so curly, volume has never been an issue, and my hair will naturally break apart (like not big clumps of defined curls). Also, I live a low waste lifestyle so the products I use are very minimal and find less is more (conditioning cream and sometimes flaxseed gel). I did discover recently that I‚Äôve been wearing my hair in a braid so often due to Covid and never leaving the house that my curls had gone limp for a bit. It took about a week or two to revive! Your hair may need some time. I‚Äôd recommend a deep hair conditioning day maybe and stay patient:-) A curly hair stylist/professional May be able to help to! Just some thoughts there. Best of luck!!!"
SerialKnitter2222,oifykn,All of this & adding either CurlSmith Bond Rehab Salve (holy grail for me) or Olaplex 3 to fix your damaged curls.  They are bond builders & are amazing.  A little pricey for some but IMO totally worth it
egbert71,oifykn,That smile
nataliehndz,oifykn,"So in my opinion there are two things you can do to get your curls back and healthy.

1. Use products that don‚Äôt have sulfate and silicone in them. Use protein to bring back those curls. Deep condition twice a week. Hydration, hydration, hydration. For I can see, they are very dry.

2. Big chop, if you are impatient, just cut it all up and start over.

You can dm me if you have any mor questions. Best of luck! üòä"

isabelladeck,oifvtd,Do you guys scrunch the crunch before you go to bed or sleep with it and crunch in the morning?&&&
xkjax,oifvtd,"I do most at night because if I lie on it funny it makes it wonk permanently until I rewet it. I'll leave in a bit of the crunch to avoid frizz still, but if I leave it all I just end up with such wonky curls. I find my curls survive better overnight when theyre already styled and settled rather than still in a cast personally."
MrKBC,oifuo3,"I haven‚Äôt tried any products from Miss Jessie‚Äôs, however, I tried Curlsmith almost immediately after the Devacurl ‚Äúscandal‚Äù dropped. Having tried the majority of every product offered by Curlsmith - excluding some treatments and newer cleansers & conditioners - I‚Äôve developed some thoughts. 

As a whole, I feel that the brand works best for tighter curl patterns (3b-4c) while the loose curl patterns have to do a bit of experimenting to find the right styling cocktail that works best for their hair. Now for the nitty gritty:

I enjoy the major fit of the moisture line as whole, however, I find that the spray used for the Reactivator to be subpar at best. The Co Wash is my favorite, the Double Cream deep conditioner is lovely, and the four stylers are the best offered in my mind. 

The Scalp Line has a great Scrub and Conditioner duo plus a Primer that I find to be rather redundant. The Hydro Creme deep conditioner is a lovely option if your hair is dying for hydration without being weighed down. I feel that the same can be said of the two stylers included in the line due to every product containing a decent amount of Hyaluronic Acid for that moisture boost, however, this comes with a lack of hold and definition in the long term. 

Out of the Strength Line I‚Äôve tried three of the products offered. The Bond Curl Salve to me is a decent protein treatment that results in soft, fortified, and moisturized hair unbecoming of a protein treatment. The Protein Cream adds a decent amount of definition which couples nicely with the volume gained from using the Foam. I may be biased, however, as I just enjoy foams and mousses as a whole for my hair. 

I would like to one day try the Multitasking Conditioner from the Strength line but the rest of the products haven‚Äôt peeked my interest. If I‚Äôm being honest I always forget that a fourth line focusing on Color is also available for purchase. 

Well, that was significantly longer than I had intended for which I do apologize. I really need to stop looking at Reddit late at night. Hope some of this helps with your dilemma."
estornudo,oifuo3,"Thoughts on these products?&&&Got burned recently when I bought some Deva Curl products only to learn right after that there's a lawsuit with tons of people claiming it made their hair fall out.
