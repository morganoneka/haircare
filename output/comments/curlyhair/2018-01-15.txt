papayaslice,7s2tqe,"what exactly are you talking about, the short hairs around the lock youâ€™re pulling down? if you give a little more information we can try and help. "
shortcurlygurly,7s2tqe,"What is happening to my hair here? What can I do to fix it?&&&&&&Yesss, the hairs around the strand. &&&Thank you!"
Crushing-it,7s253w,Gorgeous hair! Did you dye your hair yourself? Because mine is a few shades darker green and I'm having a tough time figuring out how to get it brown again.
dxrlingdxrko,7s253w,"It ainâ€™t Tuesday but that is one heck of a transformation&&&&&&Yes I lost my soul. It was Christmas with the in laws between these two pictures

My routine: 
Lushâ€™s new! Shampoo bar (not CG)
Suave essentials coconut conditioner (never using this again because Iâ€™m allergic to it) 
Aloe Vera gel as my styler&&&I did! First I faded the green as much as possible with baking soda and a dish soap mix. So I used a red protein filler to cancel out the green in my hair. I used it as a wash our hair mask first and then I mixed with my hair dye to cancel out any other green left over

Edit: this is the one I used [protein filler](http://www.sallybeauty.com/color-products-protein-color-filler/SBS-636305,default,pd.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adpos=1o3&scid=scplpSBS-636305&sc_intid=SBS-636305&utm_content=SBS-636305&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtJbTBRDkARIsAIA0a5P-XcLQ2HqH8QDaNU5om2JC9J0kZGy50N6wDKWdY6SUi4HrSL9HHQEaAoQNEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) &&&Thank you! I deep condition once a week and I oil my hair with jojoba oil to keep it healthy now"
loralei2u,7s253w,It's so pretty and shiny!
ChubberTheChubber,7s18hb,"OH. MY. DOG.
I will kill for curls like that.  Good job!  The diffuser is your friend!"
CurlyBoiii,7s18hb,"First time using a diffuser, came out kinda nice&&&&&&Routine is what I normally do, but I used a diffuser rather than air drying:

Cowashing with Tressame curl hydrating conditioner, rinsing it off by shaking my head, and then scrunching my hair with a microfiber towel (and then diffusing). I think since I only shake off the conditioner with the water running through my hair, there is still a very little bit of conditioner left in my hair that helps with both the shine and the frizz. Only very minimal shaking/picking outside the shower, just a tiny bit to even out the amount of hair everywhere.

.

The only real difference I noticed with a diffuser was that my hair dried in 10 minutes rather than 2+ hours, maybe the reason why my hair looks more or less the same as usual is that my hair is too short to be affected by a diffuser?&&&I use a microfibre towel or a tshirt to scrunch my hair a bit. I never like rub it around, it's either scrunching or kind of pat the towel around."
Festeroo4Life,7s18hb,Your hair is so fun!
Ivy0902,7s18hb,"Ahhh! your curls are ridiculously perfect! Like, did you escape from a renaissance work of art? Are you part cherub?  Did you sell your soul to satan for that curl pattern? "
KiloWhiskeyOne,7s18hb,Looks like my Grannies Hair 
Koalabella,7s18hb,You look like a painting on the side of an ancient vase. Itâ€™s perfect!
LookingForEquanimity,7s18hb,Woah! Cool hair!
ahouseofballoons,7s18hb,You have beautiful hair!
akpipsqueak,7s18hb,Your curls are ridiculous- in the best way!
avalanchethethird,7s18hb,This is a very accurate description
collectiblecurls,7s18hb,"btw, how do you dry your hair coming out of the shower? looks amazing :]&&&tell your grannie to hmu then cuz she must have some nice curls"
geekysugar,7s18hb,Wow! Your curls are perfect!
giselledelamo,7s18hb,Perfect curls! 
janetplanet,7s18hb,I would sell my first born to have curls this perfect!
lolafairfax,7s18hb,Kinda nice? Try glorious!
mochi0425,7s18hb,ðŸ˜® nice curls 
onod32,7s18hb,What kind of diffuser did you use?
paythemandamnit,7s18hb,Your curls are angelic!
redhairdefcare,7s18hb,"A diffuser helps dry your hair gently enough to not disturb the curl pattern but also fast enough that the weight of the wet hair canâ€™t stretch out the curl shape.  Given that you have short hair and what looks like a very strong curl shape, Iâ€™m not surprised you didnâ€™t see a big difference.  Looks like a Greek statue!"
satinsateensaltine,7s18hb,Gorgeous curl pattern! 
southern_fox,7s18hb,"Wtf, I need your hair! Gimme! "
nattydubbs,7s181f,Love her curls&&&&&&I use Shea mountain kids products on her. Then the detangler brush with leave in conditioner and let it air dry.
Jgrnl77,7s14ag,Wet your hair and apply conditioner before you put on the swim cap! Old swimmerâ€™s trick. 
furioso2000,7s14ag,Hmm..any chance you can add a satin liner into your work hat?
iamsodonewu,7s14ag,"How do I deal with hat head from work?&&&Itâ€™s gonna be getting warmer soon and I canâ€™t exactly wear a beanie to cover up the mess my work hat makes..

Also Iâ€™m gonna start swimming too , maybe I just a swim cap to deal with chlorine but Iâ€™ll still have hat head.

I have somewhere between 3B-3C hair is that helps any."
nemicolopterus,7s0vr2,"Can we see your hair when it's curly, but styled the way you style it? When I got my DevaCut it looked soooooo bad when she styled it and soooo much better when I didn't blow-dry it while brushing (she really did that)."
omgcow,7s0vr2,"Is wearing your hair straight something you'd still like to be able to do? If so I'd get it fixed at another salon and let them see what it looks like straight. You'll probably lose some length but it might be worth it to have it grow in correctly.

Also sometimes if you use your own products and styling methods the curls will look different than they did in the salon, so I'd try styling it on your own first so you can see if it's something you can work with or not.

I'm sorry this happened to you, I had a bad haircut recently and it was devestating. "
sleptlatetoday,7s0vr2,"What to do after a DevaCut disaster?!?!&&&&&&

**Routine** (for the before, of course)

Squish n plop:    
*living proof curl conditioning wash    
*brocatto color preserve conditioner    
*shea moisture manuka honey & yogurt leave in spray    
*some LA Gear gel if it's gross out    
*sometimes Maui whatever Curl Smoothie    
*R&Co glossing wax if sprouts and ends are misbehaving     
    
     
When my hair is long, it's around a 2B or 2C. When it's short, it's a step away from 3C. Before is four years of growth with dusting trims and Balayage maintenance. Makes my heart hurt.    

Thought a DevaCut would enhance the curls. Instead, I have a 90's Psychiatrist Haircut. Hahahaha. HAHAHAHA. *sob* One side is significantly longer than the back and it has weird bulges. The hair on one side has octopus tentacles underneath it.    

Four years of growth with dusting trims and Balayage maintenance. Makes my heart hurt.  Yo ho yo ho top knot life for me since I have job interviews and my birthday is this week.  :|    

**tl;dr**
Bad haircut. Kinda don't know what to do. Major bummer. Suggestions? 

edited: for brevity.
&&&Some of the products are weather dependent. Typically use some poo, condit, and leave in. Any more layers = half poof, half wavy for me. Guess DevaCuts are known for getting chop happy - missed the memo on that one!"
southern_fox,7s0vr2,"I got a shit devacut not too long ago as well. The woman brushed my dry hair and then basically cut layers into it while it was in a huge fluffy mess. It was kinda traumatic. So I feel your pain. BUT as someone else said, it does look much better when I style it on my own and use my regular products. And it kinda took a while for my hair to get used to being cut a different way, like after a few Co washes and styles it started to curl better. Give it time... and look into a Gibson roll/tuck or headband roll style for interviews and birthday!  Good luck!"
vivianbelfort,7s0vr2,"I would add some layers to get more curls. 
Maybe don't use so many products.  Just stick to 2."
LoonWithASpoon,7s0qcw,"My three perfect little ringlets!&&&&&&Curly routine
Shampoo close to scalp with ion keratin shampoo 
Ion keratin conditioner through tips and to untangle roots
Brush with wide tooth comb
Clip to head and let sit until end of shower
Scrunch conditioner out
Scrunch dryish with microfiber towel
Scrunch palmerâ€™s moisturizing hair milk in
Then miss Jessieâ€™s could custard
Sometimes herbal essences set me up mousse
Plop overnight
Would love any suggestions, sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m doing too much. I started around August and Iâ€™ve come so far already. "
ahouseofballoons,7s0619,Is that your natural hair color? Itâ€™s so pretty & unique
ilovemycatsfurrytoes,7s0619,"Really loving my curls these days&&&&&&I cowash with suave strawberries n cream conditioner, use a t-shirt to get out excess water, use the same conditioner as a leave in, use some deva curl cream, la looks gel applied using praying hands then scrunching, then diffuse. Half way throuigh diffusing I apply a little more gel and scrunch, then finish diffusing. When 100% dry I sotc &&&Thank you! &&&Oh no, it's from a box lol. My natural hair color is a flat dark brown. But thank you:)"
neverdieeasy34,7s0619,They are beautiful!
scribendocogito,7s0619,I love how much definition you got. Your hair reminds me of mine. Is this pic 100% dry and already scrunched? It looks like you could get more volume without sacrificing definition by turning your head upside down and fluffing at the roots?
TMS2017,7rzy4g,"Need Hair Gel Recommendation - My Hair Gets Frizzy, Too Curly (38M)&&&I used to use this product (Alterna Hemp Curl Defining Gel Lotion), but it's been discontinued: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B2BVMPS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I'm looking for a gel/cream that reduces the frizziness and curliness I get at the top of my head. Any recommendations? Thanks much!&&&Thanks, I'll look into it!"
pyrrhalouise,7rzy4g,DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel is the best!

jac278431,7rzlgf,"People with low porosity hair does fine with baking soda shampoos, you have to make sure to do it right though, so you have to dilute the ingredients and measure out the amount to make sure you arenâ€™t adding more than needed. I use it about once a week and it definitely helps my curls. I mentioned this to the op bc she looks like she had my texture of hair and if she was straightening her hair for awhile then she probably used  products to protect her hair which can build up on the scalp easily.  And cold water does help with my hair at least witch might help her. I know that there is a guide to curly hair on here but I told her what really helped my hair type.  I do know that everyone hair type might react differently so if you guys feel that what I said is bad advice then Iâ€™m sorry."
littleredwolfzage,7rzlgf,Help me find a routine to bring back my curls!&&&&&&Iâ€™ve spent years straightening it and figured it was time to let them be natural. 
nemicolopterus,7rzlgf,"Welcome! It really looks like there are some curls hiding in there. Have you looked at the stickied note: /r/curlyhair/comments/749kmh/new_curlies_start_here/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=curlyhair
