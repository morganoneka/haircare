Istinline,l9va09,Typically you can also use your conditioner as a leave in. Lo po hair will build up easily so make sure you’re clarifying often. If you’re hair is craving moisture and you don’t want to use a leave in be sure to deep condition with heat. Lo po hair means the hair cuticle is tightly wound and it’s hard for water and products to get in but the good news is that it retains water really well. So heat will help to loosen the hair cuticle and allow the products and water t moisturize your hair.
_Sunset01,l9va09,"I heard your should never skip the leave in. I use Not Your Mother's Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter Curl Defining Detangler
Or CurlSmith Weightless Air Dry Cream :)"
meg7997,l9va09,I have a similar hair type and don't always need a leave-in. I usually skip it unless my hair feels really dry or if I'm not going to add styling products and want a little extra definition. The lightest one I've found so far is the Giovanni Direct Moisture leave-in. Been using it for a few years now and really like it. I just avoid my roots and focus on the ends/mids when appyling.
red-purple-,l9va09,I have low porosity hair and use TGIN Green Tea super moist leave in conditioner.
severussnape333,l9va09,"Leave-in?&&&Hi everyone! My hair is type 2C-3A and low porosity. I have always been scared of leave-in conditioners because they might weigh my hair down, but I feel like my hair would benefit from the moisture. Does anyone have a recommendation for my hair type that isn't too expensive? Or do you think I shouldn't get it at all?&&&Okay nice thanks!!!&&&Great, thanks!&&&Great, thanks!&&&Great, thanks!"
8MonthsofWinter,l9v463,"I have no idea if this will help *at all* but it
probably can’t hurt... a few days ago my 5 year old got an absolutely huge amount of gum completely tangled in her hair. I googled how to get gum out and assumed we’d end up having to cut at least some of it out. Google recommended using creamy peanut butter (we have the kind that is just peanuts and salt, not sure if that’s relevant) and it was like magic! I covered the gum blob in peanut butter and rubbed it in a bit and then was able to drag it straight down her hair and out of her head. Once I got all the gum out I just shampooed and conditioned her hair like normal and she was as good as new."
FashionBusking,l9v463,"I accidentally left conditioner in some of my curly hair for at least a week. How do I get it out?! HELP&&&I decided to deep condition my curly hair. 

Part of the process is washing with a clarifying shampoo first.

I found a patch of hair where I was like, ""Oh yeah, this clarifying shampoo really works!"" 

But its been 3 washes today trying to get it out.

It appears in a previous wash, at least a week ago, maybe longer, some of the conditioner in a clump embedded deep into my curls.

It isn't coming out.

I just left a very pruny bath whereby I submerged my hair and gently picked at the clump with a detangler comb.

The conditioner is still f*king there!!! I can see little flakes of it up and down the affected strands

HELP!

My hair has never seen a curling iron or any hot tool. It is super goddamn curly, like 4c. It is otherwise healthy. I rarely do anything to it other than wash, condition, and use curl rods without heat. It has never been bleached or dyed.

I've washed it 3 times today with a clarifying shampoo. I'm a little afraid to wash it again until I put together a real game plan for fear of drying it out.&&&I don't have the original conditioner any more. Does it have to be the same conditioner?

I have an oil cleaner (Hadalabo) for my face, do you think this might help?

I have some olive oil and coconut oil available. Think either of these could do the trick? (Kinda inclined to give them a try, if for no other reason than reintroduce moisture).&&&Doing that now....

If Dawn works on baby ducks soaked in crude oil... its worth a shot on my hair&&&Ok, it is working to break up the worst hardest/glumpiest of it, but not terribly efficiently. I've wrapped my head in a shower cap with Dawn in my hair for the next 20 minutes to see if a little bit more time for the Dawn to work is what is needed.&&&Next on the list to try. Thanks!&&&Conditioner that is stuck is Devacurl Decadence Conditioner.

Using Suave Clarifying shampoo. (Maybe not again?)&&&Also of note: the conditioner that refuses to leave feels gummy, almost like sunscreen with gelatin texture.&&&I wish it were gum. Its this weird slick glump in one place with a thin layer of glump radiating through the hair in its vicinity."
TheFirstArticle,l9v463,I'd try washing your hair with dawn dish soap after soaking your hair in vinegar for a few minutes.
WorthyLocks,l9v463,"However you manage to get it out, just don't use DC products again until more studies are done.  yikes!  Of all the brands to have stuck on your head, omg I feel for you!

Is it in a spot you're willing to cut it out if it comes to that?  Do you have any bentonite clay?  Maybe it would break up whatever that gunk is made out of.

Take photos.  Lots of photos.  You may need to join into one of the lawsuits if any permanent damage comes of this."
faithcollapsing,l9v463,"I had a similar issue using esalon dye once.  I couldn’t get the sludgy stuff out of my hair no matter how many times I washed or rinsed.  What ended up working was using a little baking soda mixed with conditioner.  It will be gritty, but really rub it in there and rinse it out well.  Hope it helps!"
shineymagpie,l9v463,"It sounds counterproductive, but I would work some conditioner into your hair to see if that breaks it up enough to be washed out.   I oversaturated my hair with coconut oil once, and after three shampoos it was still there. I tried conditioner out of desperation and it helped quite a bit.  I imagine it works like oil cleansers do?  Or even try working an oil cleanser into the section if you've got one available."

Babysony201,l9te29,"Show me your 2b/2c hair&&&Hi guys, I’ve started my curly girl journey. Ive always had pretty naturally wavy hair. Never realised it could be classed as curly.

DanceGriegaIlly,l9tcc0,"Recommendations for CG approved reset wash shampoo.&&&I'm looking for product recommendations for reset shampoo, one with sulfates but no silicones. Prefer a brand I can buy at Ulta since I need to accumulate points. Right now, I have been using some of my husband's Herbal Essences bio-renew shampoo which has no silicones. But it's getting low and need to replenish. And I probably need to get my own shampoo instead of take from his supply lol.&&&Thanks!

CurlMeUp,l9t7cf,"Wavy or Curly Hair?&&&My hair has thousands of tiny ultra fine hairs that appear  throughout my hair.  When I put my hair up in a pineapple, the underside of my hair is blanketed with these very fine tiny curls (little curly wispy hairs).  I have a lot of very fine hair.  I used to think it was just wavy but when I started the CGM, I noticed my hair begins curly at the root. Is this more indicative or curly hair or maybe just the fact that  I have such fine hair?

I use Carol's Daughter curl shampoo and conditioner; use As I Am leave-in conditioner; and LA Looks Gel.  I do the whole process with my head  upside down, scrunch, plop, and air dry.

Is there anything that I am doing wrong which might be causing the fuzzy hairs or is this just my hair?"
ObamasBootee,l9s3m8,"3A Curly Hair Routine&&&Hey everyone! I have been growing my hair ever since school got cancelled and quarantine started in March last year because I thought it would be fun and a new experience. And it was so funny because I was the type of guy that NEVER let my hair get past 2 inches on the top and 1 on the sides, and seeing my hair transform from straight to wavy to curly as it got longer was crazy because I always though I had straight hair since it was never long enough to show it’s curls. I would say that I’m at the end of the awkward stage of my hair growth and now it’s starting to grow down but only slightly, it’s still bushy lmao, so I feel like now would be a good time to start taking care of my hair. Now I feel like I’m a bit late into my hair growth to just start taking care of it but it’s better late then never! So I was wondering what products and what type of routine I should take in because my hair is super frizzy and dry but oily at the roots and THICK both in amount of hair and in thickness of each hair.I know some basic information like sulfate free shampoos and shampooing 1-2 times a week, but I want to know more like WHICH shampoos/conditioners I should buy and maybe even creams and stuff to put after the shower and how to style it. I don’t know the exact measurements of my hair but it’s almost down to my shoulders on the sides and the top reaches to about my nose when wet but shrinks to my forehead when dry! So any advice you all could give me would help a ton thanks!&&&Ok thanks bro!"

Somewhere_Glittering,l9rmfr,"I did.  I actually had it for probably a year and a half or so.  I went through ups and downs and lost a lot of volume during that time.  I embraced a totally new hair texture, soft and wavy, even got bangs.  I lost so much hair I wondered if I would need wigs!  It was scary at times.  But it stopped and I couldn’t tell you why.  I cut out as much medication as I could, stress, etc.  My hair has now fully recovered and the curls are back in full force!!  It is scary in the moment but all hair goes through it’s seasons."
converter-bot,l9rmfr,2 inches is 5.08 cm
cuddlyasacactus,l9rmfr,"I had telogen effluvium when I used Loestrin FE birth control, because it has high androgenic activity. This was back in 2012 and I lost about 40% of my hair, I’d estimate.

The good news is that it absolutely grows back eventually. Since so much fell at once, likewise it all had to grow back at once. And hairs take a good long while to grow. I think it’s an inch every six months for the average person?? So in six months, you’ll at least feel better about the thickness of your hair near your scalp, but the lengths will still be thin. But fret not— it all comes back eventually :)"
erizodelmar,l9rmfr,"Has anyone experienced telogen effluvium? (temporary hair loss)&&&Has anyone has instances where they lost a lot of hair but had it grow back? I read that telogen effluvium is temporary hair loss caused by stress and usually resolves itself. 

I had surgery in December and I stopped taking my birth control at the same time, which apparently also causes temporary hair loss.

qquesadillaa,l9rmfr,"I have been dealing with TE for the past year! I noticed hair loss in May 2020, from the stressed caused by getting into a work accident two months before. I would say I noticed small hair regrowth (about 2 inches ) about 6 months after my accident. However, for me I would say it was a cycle, as my new growth would shed and then the process would start over. I think this is likely due to me majorly stressing out about my hair (stress , lose hair, stress about losing hair, then more stress leads to more hair loss). I am still dealing with it, my hair has lost about 50% volume overall and is full of spider web/crown frizz, but I am just trying to embrace it as best I can, which is honestly the only thing to do. My hair hasn't caught back up to what it used to be, but slowly and surely it is growing back, (I've got about 6 in of new growth!). Just takes time.  I also have been using hair/scalp oil before showering, olaplex 3 every few months, taking hair vitamins, limiting heat styling on my hair and taking iron pills."

Istinline,l9r73e,"I would check to see if the products and wash day routine work for your hair type (porosity, texture, and density). There are other things that can cause limp hair but make sure you’re using a hard hold product (gel or mousse) at the end of your routine. Humectants like glycerin can also cause limp curls as well as a protein/moisture imbalance."
McAbby12,l9r73e,"You can protect it while sleeping by putting your hair up in a pineapple if it’s long enough, wear a silk scarf/bonnet at night, and sleep with a silk/satin pillowcase.
