berrygoodgummyworm,rf7o8g,"Straight hair naturally with curly???&&&So‚Ä¶.. I did a big chop to try new things, and to have a fresh new start, and I‚Äôve realized as my hair is slowly growing(it‚Äôs not heat damage) the middle part of my head where my hair is growing is straight (??) has anyone ever dealt with that? Everything around it is curly but just that middle part is straight üòÖ it‚Äôs confusing to me and I don‚Äôt really get that, the rest of my hair is mainly 4A"

TheMagdalen,rf7ggx,"I have dry wavy/curly hair and have had really good luck using Olaplex No. 0 and No. 3 in terms of strengthening and de-frizzing. Since it smoothes the hair cuticle, my hair also seems less dry."
calliegirl88,rf7ggx,"I also like the Olaplex products, and find the oil really helps with shine and friz"
coxxinaboxx,rf7ggx,"Super dry damaged wavy hair please help!&&&I have naturally wavy hair, unfortunately did not get my moms curls.

However my hair is dry as all get out. I just recently cut some inches off and it didn't help. It's dry and has some breakage. I put in leave in conditioner, I don't wash my hair everyday, I'm getting so frustrated so any products recommended would be great."

Hot-Repair-5710,rf62ro,Help&&&
msodjckfk7813,rf5c5a,1. Is this balding? 2. What curl type am I? 3. I currently use a coconut oil shampoo twice a week and rub Moroccan oil into my hair afterwards. Is this a poor routine based on how my hair looks? Thanks&&&
Lylleth88,rf4mp6,"Heat and chemicals damage your hair, period. There's no way to do these things and cause zero damage. However, you can cause *less* damage with good techniques: single pass, infrequent application, low heat, heat protectant sprays, newer flat iron technology, etc.

Make sure to up your nourishment: deep conditioner, maybe protein treatments, or even bond repair products if you are experiencing damage."
ShayShayLeFunk,rf4mp6,Grab a straight wig and save you hair?
SummerOk5184,rf4mp6,"Missing my blow outs‚Ä¶&&&Back when I used to go into the office, I would smooth out my curls with a curling iron every day. Then Covid hit and the curling iron went out the window (along w my makeup and business attire)! 

I didn‚Äôt discover the CGM until about 2 months ago. I went from frizzy, dry, wavy hair to lovely, full, hydrated 2c curls w pretty good definition. Not perfect definition- but I‚Äôm still learning. Changing seasons threw me for a loop. 

Anyways, lately I‚Äôve been really missing my smooth hair and blow outs. üòï toying w the idea of doing it once in a while. Do I risk sliding back to frizzy dry hair if I re-introduce heat/brushing once in a while?"
TheMagdalen,rf4mp6,"If you use a heat protectant and don‚Äôt do it too too often, you should be fine."

Well done"

Kbts87,rf4bko,"Oh my goodness, I just got one over the weekend after going literally two decades with just cutting my hair myself or asking someone for help with trimming. 10/10 definitely going back. I didn't think it would make that big of a difference, but holy cow. My curls are so defined!"
Mazkomali,rf4bko,You look stunning! Wow
PAmountaingirl4581,rf4bko,If I had someone close to my area I sure would! Gorgeous!
Sohini12,rf4bko,How did you find the stylist and what hair cut is this ?
ToastemPopUp,rf4bko,"I might be totally wrong, but to me that looks like the stylist ""framed her face,"" aka having the hair cut near her face start somewhere around the height of her ear then kinda angled down and away. It's kinda like bangs but without the full commitment."
Wavesmith,rf4bko,"Great hair, great T-shirt!"
dcotetaos,rf4bko,"Same here, I want one badly but doubt I‚Äôll find anyone that can do it"
high-on-fantasy,rf4bko,I'm a teen girl but I go through the same problem üò≠ I just trimmed my hair on Saturday and they made it lose all shape and then straightened it into a black curtain without asking me. My mom was there with me and she told me to go along with it coz of some special occasions we've got so I couldn't really tell them to not straighten it. I can't remember the last time that I cut my hair and didn't want to kill the person who cut it üò≠üò≠üò≠ anyways the search for someone who can cut my curly hair goes on...

Nice haircut though :p"
schizoanalyzer,rf4bko,"absolute hell. you get to pick between barbers that will drag their fine toothed combs through your curls and cut them when wet, or curly stylists that have no clue how to give a decent taper/fade on the sides. oh youre a dude with curly hair? guess what buddy, your only hairstyle options are kenny g or zoomer fuckboy!!

yeah im also frustrated with the situation hahahaha"

Earthch1ld,rf3hnw,Started using the satin cap to bed and its been life changing!&&&
Lylleth88,rf3go2,"Good and bad is subjective. Both of your shampoos contain silicones, and I strictly avoid all silicones. Your leave-in has aloe, heavy oils, shea, silicones and protein. I also avoid all of these ingredients.

My hair is fine, low porosity, and sensitive to protein. I have to be more careful than the next curly about what I put in it if I don't want weighed down and ultimately over time frizzy, dry hair.

How do you do on the tresemme? What are your hair goals and what do you not like about your hair now?"
South_Imagination945,rf3go2,"Which is better and if neither which one do you guys suggest (Aegean oil of Morocco or tresemme 7x moisture)&&&So my hair type is 2c-3a and I I‚Äôve been using tresemme 7x for a couple months now and I switched to argan oil of Morocco today to test it out but then I made a mistake and didn‚Äôt search it up to see the reviews, and when I did they said something about it not being good and it‚Äôs just hyped up, can someone please help me find the right products for my hair unless if argan oil is actually really good and the reviews aren‚Äôt really as bad as they say, thank you all and side note I use either cantu leave in conditioner or shea moisture mortar to moisturize my hair out of the shower. Are those good or bad products?&&&Thank you for putting in time for my question first off, but tresemme was pretty decent for me Im guessing. I‚Äôm not sure how to tell if it worked well with my hair but it did keep my hair soft and moisturized. 
 
I don‚Äôt think theirs anything I don‚Äôt like about my hair right now, really my main problem right now tho is the length of my hair, since my hair type isn‚Äôt tight curls the longer my hair gets the more it gets weighed down and then my somewhat tight wavy hair starts to get looser and looser.

I‚Äôm mainly just trying to find good products to use for my hair, I can‚Äôt find a good shampoo and conditioner in my Walmart because I noticed that the shampoos and conditioner have at least one of these unwanted ingredients listed here (sulfates, parebens, silicones, phlphlates and fragrance)"

peachy-grey,rf2h92,"Help why my waves/curls has its own gravity( bad shape)&&&&&&Hi there, so I have 2c/3a type when it was healthy, but after multiple mental breakdowns and experimenting my hair, currently dyed the top brown and  bottom is grey, 3 times bleach and 1 toner.

The bottom layer texture is completely gone and I cant recover it. The top layer is salvageable but it does want to curl at all. All in all its a mess, Im in the CGM journey and only use shea moisture products.
This picture is after normal routine of shampoo and conditioner, dried in a microfiber towel and was in a silk cap. When I open it it was like a spider web, always happens everytime I wake up.
Im distraught, with life and exams and now hair. Please help."
