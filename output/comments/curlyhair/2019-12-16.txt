yasmingazquez,eefkei,"I wanna cut my hair really short but I can't think of any specifics styles, any ideas?&&&"
Pixie2343,eef8e1,"Have you been clarifying your hair regularly?

You don't mention your hair type, but I have coarse,thick hair and find that I need a hard hold gel to make sure the weight doesn't pull it flat.

My HG gel is the Garnier Pure Clean gel; maybe give it a try?"
curvyncurlyy,eef8e1,"Moisture overload/Flat curls&&&I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm advance for the long-winded post, but I would really appreciate your help! 

This summer I used Cantu‚Äôs shampoo and conditioner for natural hair and ended up with moisture-overload. My hair was very soft and shiny, but my curls were limp waves. 
I then changed to Curls‚Äô blueberry line, using their shampoo and leave-in conditioner. After combing my hair I would apply the blueberry curl gel, followed by their creme br√ªl√©e curl cream.  I typically shower in the evening and let my hair air dry. 
After a month of using only Curls‚Äô products on my hair my curls were coming back to life, but I noticed that if I wore my (fully dry) hair up for even a few hours, once I let it down the length of my hair smelled yeasty. My scalp had no issues, only the portion of my hair I applied product to. 
I stopped using the Curls blueberry shampoo and conditioner and now my hair smells fine even four days after my wash day. 
I have now switched to garnier whole blends (not completely sure of the name) shampoo and conditioner with aloe and coconut water. This combined with the blueberry gel and creme br√ªl√©e curl cream seems to be light weight enough that my curls are finally getting their bounce back, but they‚Äôre still falling flat after two days or so. By the third day I have typically given up and put it into a messy ponytail. 
I put my hair into a loose pineapple every night and I take it down the next morning, mist my hair and slightly scrunch it to refresh the curls. I feel like I‚Äôm taking the right steps to preserve my curls but it‚Äôs not working like I would hope. 
I would love any advice!&&&I haven‚Äôt clarified my hair recently and you‚Äôre right, I probably should. I‚Äôll definitely do that, especially considering I‚Äôve switched products so much in the past few months. 
My hair type is very coarse and thick as well. I‚Äôll definitely try that. I typically look for medium hold because my hair was still transitioning from being straightened for years, but now that I‚Äôve gone curly for a two years, my curls are bouncy spirals. Now that you mention it, it makes sense that I might need something with a stronger hold now.
Thank you for your help!&&&I‚Äôve been looking to include protein in my routine for awhile but if I‚Äôm being honest, I wasn‚Äôt really sure where to look. Thanks for your suggestion, I‚Äôll definitely look into ordering that online!"
trevorishy,eef8e1,It might be because the Curls blueberry bliss has protein in it and it helps your curls from limping. You might like to add products with protein in your routine or use Neutral protein filler and mix with your leave in and conditioner. Giovanni smooth as silk line also have protein and wont be too heavy or too moisturizing for your hair type. Adding a stronger hold gel like Aussie instant freeze might help avoid flat curls too.
ICThestrals,eef3j9,"Curl hair products with light to no scents&&&Hello!

I recently went to the salon for a much needed haircut. I left with some new products thanks to am awesome sale, but the products smell very strongly. They don't bother me too much, but I work in the health care industry and my office has a strict no scent policy. I'm extremely worried I'm going to make someone have a reaction ‚òπÔ∏è. I got the Kevin Murphy killer curls cream, and it has done AMAZING things for my hair type. I'm curious to know if there are any lighter scent creams out there that would give similar results. I'm only sort of following the curly girl method right now, I'm not a huge fan of the rules. But I try to stick to sulfate free, silicone free, and phalate free products. My hair is more loose beachy waves with a few thicker curls throughout. I am light blonde and my hair texture is very fine with basically no porosity. I look like a greasy weighed down mess very easily s a result so I would prefer products that aren't super oily. Right now I am using the Kevin Murphy moisture line of shampoos to try and get some moisture back into my hair since it's so dry where I live. I typically wash my hair every two days and then squish out extra water into a t-shirt, put in the Kevin Murphy killer curls cream combing it through with my fingers and then scrunching. Then I diffuse with no heat. Seems to be the best results with products so far for my hair type. I am just very concerned about the strong scents! TIA!&&&That's awesome! I had no idea. Thank you for the suggestion üòä&&&Right! I was finding that as well ‚òπÔ∏è! I can't justify spending a ton of money on a product that may not work for me. That's why I have been looking to drugstores more for my products but the fragrances are a little too strong for me sometimes.  I really don't want to go over 20.00 for a bottle of product. 15.00 would be ideal but I will to go a little extra if the product is really good. I'm also okay with spending more if there is a large amount of product that will take me a while to go through."
Trev_x,eef3j9,Check out the Jessicurl products - they come in three scents one of which is unscented and you can try out samples for a low cost.
nruthh,eef3j9,"What‚Äôs your budget? The only unscented curly products I‚Äôve found are insanely expensive. It‚Äôs really unfortunate, because there is such a market for fragrance free products."
Expelled_Hermoine,eeeh1f,Your hair looks great!  Thanks for the specifics.  I'm going to be trying this...
_unknown_username,eeeh1f,"Supermarket products including olive oil!&&&&&&Routine:

I have loved my curls forever and have tried every conceivable salon product on the market to no avail other than having an expensive array of half used products gracing my bathroom.

I decided to go back to basics and back to supermarket products which has given me the results (and compliments!) that I've been after.

1. Whatever shampoo is on special, every 10 days or so
2. Garnier Fructis Normal Strength & Shine conditioner daily / co-wash leave in for 5 minutes or so
3. Turban hair in towel to absorb moisture - no rubbing!
4. L'Oreal or Schwarzkopf leave in with 5 drops of olive oil applied with praying hands - no fingers!

I found the olive oil is just as good if not better than Argan oil - and is certainly cheaper. YMMV.

Wishing you aMerry Christmas, a Happy New Year and luxurious curls!&&&Thank you! I hope it works for you. Let me know how you go."
toadexplosion,eeeh1f,Looks fantastic!
IceniQueen69,eeeen0,I twirl the strands and don‚Äôt touch them again until they dry.
bubbledamn,eeeen0,"How to apply gel on thin wavy hair&&&Hi! So I recently just started cg method. I have thin wavy hair (not really sure which I think 2a). 

Any suggestions or tips that have worked for you!?&&&What mouses do you like?"
mercurys-daughter,eeeen0,"I have that hair type and I prefer scrunching method! I also prefer mousse over gel, but that‚Äôs not for everyone"
bigballbrand156,eee89o,Oof&&&
carmastronardi,eed894,"DevaCurl Hairloss&&&I have been on the CGM for about 7 months and have been religiously using DevaCurls Delight line. I have recently been seeing that devacurl has been making people‚Äôs hair fall out and thin. What exact products are correlated to the hair loss lawsuits? I have and currently been using the low-poo delight, one condition delight, b‚Äôleave in, wave maker, and the ultra gel. I don‚Äôt know whether to switch brands or not... I have not been able to find a professional alternative to DevaCurl that is not drugstore."
sincerelyanonymus,eed894,"I think it's mainly their cleansers such as the no poos. Which makes since because those are the only products that should be touching your scalp. That being said, since the other products don't touch the scalp, they may or may not be contributing as well."

dubsteph_,eectrl,Lmao
enyapickle,eectrl,"Sometimes TJ Maxx/Marshall‚Äôs (if you‚Äôre in the US) are great places to find cheaper, fancier products. A lot of times they‚Äôll have Shea moisture or amika and other good, smaller brands. 

Do you scrunch anything into your hair when you scrunch it? Like I put a lot of gel in my hair when it‚Äôs soaking wet after the shower and scrunch with the gel, then scrunch/dry with a t-shirt or microfiber towel and plop for as long as I can manage (I‚Äôm like you and only make it 15 min max) and once your hair is dry it‚Äôll be kinda crunchy but defined & you can ‚Äúscrunch out the crunch‚Äù (which people call SOTC) which will break up the gel & leave voluminous, defines curls! I use the herbal essences totally twisted gel and it‚Äôs about $3 & smells amazing."

lovable_cube,eectrl,Not curl related but if you're dying your hair yourself you can just put color on your roots and do an all over dye to refresh your color once every six months to revive color there. Also make sure you're only using volume 10 developer to avoid damage for faster growth!

thankyouandplease,eectrl,"I‚Äôd recommend finding products that don‚Äôt have silicone! isitcg.com has been useful as I‚Äôm starting out, you can copy and paste an ingredient list and it will show you if there‚Äôs silicones or other non-CG stuff"
trinometry,eectrl,"a photo from Thanksgiving, thought it would belong here!&&&&&&oh yeah it confused me too when I first saw the picture and I was there! it‚Äôs a cardigan of mine that I had let fall off my shoulders and it‚Äôs hanging off the arm that I have around my mom.&&&I‚Äôm on the furthest left beside my mom. I forgot I need to mention my routine.
I have lurked around on this sub for a while and am looking to make major changes to my routine as I continue grow my hair out, since I‚Äôd like more volume and the products I have aren‚Äôt really delivering (nor are they CG method). So any advice is welcome. 
At the moment, I primarily use Tresemm√© moisturizing shampoo and color protection conditioner (I dye my hair dark brown, it‚Äôs naturally an ashy blonde). I honestly only use those two because they were given to me, and they work to a degree. 
I wash it almost every day, skipping shampoo intermittently, because I can‚Äôt stand not to and it loses volume fast. I leave some conditioner in and do those scrunchy hand motions before I plop it in a t-shirt for as long as I can stand (10-15 mins). 
I also diffuse upside down with a heat protectant spray for some volume and scrunch Suave mousse on the ends to hold some of the less enthusiastic curls.
Again, any advice is welcome! I‚Äôve been doing the same thing for a long time and this is the longest my hair has ever been in my life so I have a lot to learn!"
westalalne,eectrl,This is a beautiful picture. You should ask the lady in white what her routine is OP.

MittensToeBeans,eecq94,Headband Recommendations&&&I recently cut a few inches off and can‚Äôt put my hair in a pineapple at the gym like I used to. I‚Äôm thinking of pulling it back and using a headband to get my bangs out of my face but I don‚Äôt want to ruin my curls. Any recommendations for fabrics and/or brands?
WeAreStarless,eecq94,BizzyB headbands are very popular on curly instagram!
ravenclaw17,eecq94,"I don't think any headband will ruin your curls for the amount of time you're at the gym. The sweat is another story, at least for me! But I just use a cheap stretchy headband, probably got it at Target. It might stretch my hair out at the root a little, but a fluff and/or refresh makes it presentable again."
streetsaheadd,eecq94,Head bands I see recommended by a couple of curly youtubers I follow are made by bizzybcrafts on Instagram! I haven‚Äôt gotten one yet but they‚Äôre pretty cute!!
Ballzy124,eec0nv,"Anyone else loose a bunch of hair when detangleing in the wash?&&&&&&Oh shit that's so bad. I had no idea, the product I use was recommended to me by my hair dresser who also has curly hair. My hair is also waist length.

I posted this pic for a bit of fun, but now it's like a wake up call&&&I always swirl it all together and put it in the bin next to the shower. Our drains are very small&&&I use coconut curl shampoo and conditioner, coconut curl hair cream and coconut curl hair mousse.  I wrap with a microfiber towel to get most of the moisture out then I diffuse it. I keep it in a satin hair bag for sleep and wear around the house to get the springy curls. 

This photo was taken after I had detangled my hair. I never realised how much hair I lost until today! I'm really surprised I'm not bald yet, however I do have almost waist length curls&&&3 or 4 days between washes."
RidiculouslyNikki,eec0nv,"I've put it down to the fact that I no longer brush my hair, getting the shed out. So now it mostly comes out in the shower."
auburrito,eec0nv,"I think it's normal for it to look like there's a lot of hair shed because we don't brush every day and so the shed hairs stay in our hair until we detangle. I had such a problem with drain clogging in my shower, but I do recommend those tub mushroom things. They catch all the hair before going down the drain and you can easily take all the caught hair and toss it after showering."
cheerio_ninja,eec0nv,I had postpartum shed too. The hairloss in the shower was terrible.
hello_berrie,eec0nv,Oh yeah and it's a real pain in the ass to not let it all go down the drain
kashosh,eec0nv,"A lot of CG enthusiasts will tell you hair loss is normal and you‚Äôll listen until you have half the hair you used to have 6 months ago. This is what happened to me and it‚Äôs so heartbreaking. Please be mindful of how often you‚Äôre washing and detangling, if you‚Äôre losing this much hair every 3-4 days you should reassess and try switching your products so you can compare the shedding and figure out if the products are the problem. 
I used DevaCurl for 6 months and everyone told me that it‚Äôs normal to lose clumps of hair in the shower. I really regret listening to them. Now DevaCurl is being sued."
nruthh,eec0nv,"That‚Äôs a lot of hair. How long are you going in between washes? Hair loss is so easily missed when going CG, because everyone says it‚Äôs normal. Sometimes it‚Äôs not. There are things to watch out for. How long has it been since you washed last?"
sincerelyanonymus,eec0nv,"How many days did you go in between washes?  If this was only 1-2 days I'd be worried about products/detangling causing breakage, but seems on par for 3 or more days."
Steampunk_Gypsy,eebzub,"Growing out a side shave - I think it's going well!&&&&&&Today's routine:

* Wash with Maple Holistic's Argan Oil shampoo
* Condition with a handful of MH's Silk18 conditioner; let sit for a while
* Rake in a quarter size of amount of Suave Essentials strawberry conditioner; squish
* Get hair wet again, rinsing out some (but not all) of the conditioner
* Add another quarter size amount of Suave Essentials; squish

* Spray heavily with pure aloe vera gel; squish
* Shake hair into style; spray on some more aloe vera gel

NormaKin,eebjxr,"Looking for a good leave-in myself, but SheaMoisture's Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Hair Masque is definitely my holy grail for deep conditioning. You can get it at Ulta, both in stores and online."
Pixie2343,eebjxr,"If they carry Briogeo, this is a fantastic CG line! I love the banana/coconut shampoo and their don't despair repair hair mask, and the new honey mask in a bear bottle"
THEJinx,eebjxr,"Some Not Your Mothers are quite good. Check ingredients, of course!

Don't let them convince you to get Deva or Pattern.  Deva is being shown to cause hair loss, and some Pattern products have silicones.

Perfect Hair Day Living Proof and Dermorganics are two brands that I like."
fakeprincess,eebjxr,"Favorite leave in and deep conditioners at Ulta?&&&My mom has hinted that she would like a leave in and deep conditioner for Christmas. I‚Äôd prefer to get something at Ulta just because of the rewards program. 

I typically only buy drugstore (not your mother‚Äôs is my favorite brand), however I‚Äôd prefer to get her something a little bit nicer as it‚Äôs a gift and she can afford to buy another if she likes it. She‚Äôs not someone who typically likes drugstore products. I‚Äôm overwhelmed looking at all the mid to high end options at Ulta.

Any recommendations would be appreciated, cruelty free would be preferred however that‚Äôs my preference not hers. Thanks much :)&&&Thank you !&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you !"
sincerelyanonymus,eebjxr,"AG is a good brand, especially in the winter since they have stylers that are glycerin free."
trevorishy,eebjxr,"I second the suggestion for AG products, for hair that likes protein or prone to getting flat, the AG recoil is a good styling product, but it can be drying because it contains salt. Ouidad has the anti humidity gel and the Vitacurl cream that's also good but pricy."
Cmtch,eebil3,"That is insane, your hair has grown so much in two months too and looks so much thicker! It's so pretty. Do you have any treatment secrets? Hahaha"
WonderNoodle09,eebil3,"Been on CG for about 2 months now and it‚Äôs really transformed my hair!&&&&&&I love my waves now! Before starting i‚Äôve really been curling my hair with a flat iron almost every day and didn‚Äôt even realize I could achieve almost the same look naturally just by taking care of it properly ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pantene was really killing my hair too. I‚Äôve had ‚Äúfluffy straight‚Äù hair all my life but I guess it was just dried out and poofed by sulfates. The no sulftates made the biggest difference for sure.

2a high porosity hair!

Routine:
 1x a week shampoo with loreal eversleek no-poo

Turn head upside down

Squish to condish (bowl method) with Suave Essentials coconut conditioner 

Use roping technique to apply kinky curly curling custard and scrunch (don‚Äôt overscrunch)

Plop with tshirt for as long as until it gets uncomfortable or I need to remove it, maybe like 1-2 hours

Remove and use tshirt to scrunch out excess water. Air dry, flipping hair side to side so the roots don‚Äôt dry totally flat. 

After it‚Äôs totally dry scrunch out the crunch (takes like 3 hours to dry but it‚Äôs worth üò≠)&&&The only treatment I do is like a random keratin protein mask that i‚Äôve already had, once a month or so. After I use that up I‚Äôll start looking into other treatments. I think it‚Äôs just that my hair is super high porosity and thirsty for moisture (especially from damage and the dyed ends) so the protein and conditioner moisture has changed it a lot. I believe the suave conditioner also has protein in it. For me, I think the trick is to not be afraid of leave in and leave just the right amount of conditioner in my hair with the squish to condish method...I‚Äôve had days where I accidentally rinsed out a little too much and my hair goes back to looking puffy and stringy like before.&&&Curly girl as in the curly girl method, if you look in the about section of the subreddit they have a guide for it and a beginner‚Äôs routine.&&&Thank you!"

tuffbunny3469,eebil3,"New to the subreddit, what does CG stand for?"
auburrito,eebcan,"Two years ago, I didn't know I had curls.&&&&&&Just realized I had a picture of myself at my desk at work that are two years apart. I always thought I had ‚Äústraight but frizzy‚Äù hair growing up and I would constantly straighten it before I found sulfate and silicone free products like Maui Moisture shampoo and conditioner, which is what my routine consisted of in the before picture. A year ago I discovered the CG method and it just amazes me how much my hair changed.

 
Current Routine: 
Shampoo with Kinky Curly Come Clean, Condition with Kinky Curly Knot Today, rinse out and use Denman brush upside down while hair is still wet in shower to form clumps. Pray in a tiny bit of DevaCurl Touchable Curl Definer Cream and scrunch out extra moisture still upside down using hands and microfiber towel. Scrunch in a generous amount of Giovanni LA Hold Styling Gel and diffuse upside down until 80-90% dry. Clip roots for volume and do the rest of my getting ready routine before taking out and gently scrunching out any leftover crunch.


Edit to add: I deep condition every so often using Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt Protein mask under a thermal cap for about 30 min."
