Wavyhaircare,kha84w,"Well, I don't think your hair looks ratty at all! 

But getting hair to stay clumped/defined is often dependent on using the right styling product with enough hold. Most people rely on gel for hold, I prefer mousse. Did you get a cast from the mousse? If not, I'd recommend trying to use more next time to see if you can get a cast and then if you get a cast, you'll probably maintain definition longer. Your hair looks thick (in terms of density) so you may have to use quite a bit of mousse to get good coverage.

A lot of people really like that mousse but I found it only gives me a medium-hard cast not a hard hold, and only gives me 1 day of definition, where I can get up to 3 days out of other mousses. So that mousse may not have quite enough hold for you but if your initial results weren't well defined from it, then i'd definitely try using more to see if it's an amount issue."
WeAreStarless,kha84w,"for me what makes all the difference when it comes to definition is tons of gel, on soaking wet hair. the way i do this is to apply my gel while i'm still in the shower. i rake it through my hair, and then i use a wide tooth comb or a denman brush to distribute it and to create frizz-free clumps. then i scrunch scrunch scrunch, sometimes spraying more water on it to make sure it doesn't dry out. (then i plop and hammock diffuse.)

this might not work for everyone, but that's my recipe for frizz-free hair!"
jeepkat4011,kha84w,"My hair always looks so ratty. It wants to curl but then just goes flat and icky. How do you keep your curls clumped and not all frizzy?&&&&&&I had to watch a video on hammock plopping but that makes a lot of sense! Thank you so much for that tip!&&&Interesting. I haven't had the cast effect. I usually only use a small pump and put it in while my hair is wet and plop. I'll definitely try way more next time!

How wet should my hair be? Will I still get a cast if my hair is pretty wet or should I let it dry a bit?&&&I'll admit, I have no consistency in hair products or routine! After good reviews and how cheap the line is I tried today,  herbal essences curl shampoo and conditioner. I get out and put coconut milk oil on it with praying hands. I put some herbal essences totally twisted mousse in it too.

I've tried the deva curl and hated the shampoo with my crazy thick hair. I never felt I could get it to not look greasy. I've tried perfect hair day shampoo and detangler and it's far to drying. I've tried Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner and liked it, but my hair is still ratty like this. I've tried 10 types of mousse and still frizzy. Leave in conditioner, frizzy. If I use a clarified shampoo it's just super frizzy. Dont even get me started on how much worse it looks if I dare try and diffuse it. I have the bottom half of my hair shaved off (undercut) and while I still have plenty of volume, it's just ugly. Half wants to be curly, half wants to be straight. Hot iron curls do not hold in my hair. Very tempted to get a soft perm.

I'm so lost in my journey....help :("
PastaM0nster,kh9hi4,"Traveling advice&&&So I‚Äôm flying somewhere for a couple days, and my leave in and curl cream I can easily pack in a small container in my carry on, but I‚Äôm having a problem figuring out how to pack my styling foam, and I can‚Äôt find any mini bottles of it online. Anyone know of a way to pack foam products or should I just skip it those days?&&&I only have a carry on, i can‚Äôt take the full size on board&&&That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll probably end up doing, was just wondering I anyone know of a way to pack it"
WeAreStarless,kh9hi4,"just skip it, it's only a couple of days"
anisomabun,kh9hi4,For foam products I normally tape top and then out it in a plastic or ziploc blag. This way it is less likelyto spill and if it does the rest of your stuff doesnt get wet.
BebEggHed,kh9ghn,"Try coil hair ties! I use them all the time and they really hold onto my curls (3A) without leaving an imprint. You can find them easily online, but here‚Äôs an example: https://www.ulta.com/traceless-hair-ring?productId=xlsImpprod13221269"
Franticdesigner,kh9ghn,"How do I wear a bun without ruining my curls?&&&I typically go 3 days between washes to avoid damaging my hair, but I find that hair ties make an impression on my hair. Does anyone have any tips that would allow me to wear my hair up one day and down (presentably üòÖ) the next.&&&Queueing the YouTube how to videos now! Thank you!&&&Mostly (presumably cotton) scrunchies or elastic bands if I want it to hold. Do you think silk would be the way to go?"
LettuceJizz,kh9ghn,"Your mileage may vary, but I use a hair stick (or a sharp pencil or a chop stick - whatever's handy). I can lightly twist it up and just hold it that way with the stick, but you don't have to do it tightly."
Liv_NB,kh9ghn,"I use an invisibobble to pineapple my hair but I wear my pineapple at my crown rather than further forward. It doesn't dent my hair at all.

I do this to sleep, in the evenings, for the gym, or if my hair is annoying me, and then can go back to hair down."
SavedForSaturday,kh9ghn,What kind of ties are you using?
StarMazyy,kh96vv,Can I ruin my hair if I straighten it?&&&[removed]&&&I was just think of only straightening it the day I get the hair cut but I don‚Äôt know if I should go to a regular salon or a curly salon( idk what they‚Äôre called).

applebeesknees18,kh96vv,"Depends. If you start straightening every day or every other day you'll change or lose your curl pattern. If you straighten once a week, and use hear protectant, I think that's fine."

ArbitraryBaker,kh7w4l,"Ahhh. I have 2b hair, and about one year in to CGM I‚Äôve finally realized a big reason that big parts of CGM don‚Äôt work for me might just be because my hair isn‚Äôt curly enough. 

Oil? No 


Plop? No

Dry with a t-shirt instead of a regular towel? No need, and I never understood whether the reason to avoid a towel was because a towel is too absorbent or not absorbent enough. 


Refresh? No such thing unless you mean complete wet down. 

Pineapple? No, because refreshes are just never a thing that works. I‚Äôm either going to have to restyle it from scratch or cover it up all day."

Feeya_b,kh7w4l,Oh I found this too! I gave the person an award because my first experience with the curly hair community I was scared... but thankfully this sub is pretty chill.
Fitncurly,kh7w4l,I‚Äôm thinking of doing the same but I‚Äôm soooo scared to damage it!  It‚Äôs like 3b/3c and down to my butt‚ÄîI‚Äôd hate to mess that up so I‚Äôm waffling about either going light blonde or henna jet black.  Are you tightly curly?  Do you notice any breakage/thinning?
Fraunoctua,kh7w4l,Mainly out of jealousy lol&&&It‚Äôs so true thou. I‚Äôve had curls my whole life. Once I posted a picture here (later deleted for privacy reasons) with my routine of sulfate shampoo and no deep conditioning and I was very criticized and downvoted although my hair is healthy and looked (looks) great (to me anyway). It made me think the CGM community is all about the rules and not about the results.

P0t4t012,kh7w4l,"What I found works really well for me is loading up my hair with conditioner and then brushing it through (with a regular brush, not a wide-tooth comb) IN the shower.

I just squish to condish after that and it retains my curl pattern just fine

Snoo28371,kh7w4l,"Cult all the way. I refuse to ever get a Deva Cut. The whole thing feels like profiteering. Its a freaking haircut, not rocket science. I certainly do some of thr CG method stuff, but the whole business is so overwrought. Curly girls and guys think there's some magical way to do it, and the truth is: THERE ISN'T. Different things work for different people and not everyone wants the CG style of flat, glossy curls. (I dont, for one.)

It‚Äôs absolutely insane to me that most licensed hairdressers simply cannot cut or style natural waves or curls when there‚Äôs a MASSIVE untapped clientele just waiting for them to. 

Of course I am speaking from my own experience with salons that primarily deal with hair on folks that aren‚Äôt black ‚Äî not sure how black salons are with styling natural hair so I can‚Äôt speak on those."
tenebrigakdo,kh7w4l,"Ooofff, that's me. Luckily I never mentioned it in numbers :D  
I was pretty sad after a few months when it turned out they will never curl more than 3A on a wash day and drop right down to 2A/B before the next one, but hell they look so much better than back when I used to attempt to dry them straight."

Snoo28371,kh7k6u,"I also bleach my curls. I've found that really moisturizing conditioner and styling products help a ton to boost the curl.

dorothysideeye,kh7k6u,"I have a similar issue. Protein treatment and deep conditioner have helped, as well as changing up what products I use. My curls aren't nearly as poppin as they were pre-bleach, but I notice a difference after the protein especially."

WeAreStarless,kh7baa,"Hi! Your post has been temporarily removed because you have not included your hair care routine. We require this for all photo posts, even if the photo is not of yourself. Please reply to this comment with more info and we can reapprove it for you!

Here‚Äôs what we mean by ‚Äúroutine‚Äù:
- Which shampoo, cowash and/or conditioner you used
- Any other products (your gel, mousse, etc.), their brand/name, & how you applied them
- How you dried your hair (air dried? diffused? etc.)
- Anything else that‚Äôs helpful to know!

We require this because it helps keep r/curlyhair focused on learning & helping each other instead of just selfies.

Thank you!"
butterscunt,kh7baa,"Wash day ü•∞&&&&&&Ohhhhh apologies!! 
Here‚Äôs what I do... 
‚Ä¢wash with Tresemme Shampoo, leave in Conditioner (moisture rich) for 3 mins and rinse out.
‚Ä¢in the shower while my hair is soaking wet, I apply Aunt Jackies Curl La La, curls defining custard, comb it though my hair, concentrating on the ends as I tend to have a greasy scalp. Scrunch and try not to squeeze a lot of the water out
‚Ä¢wrap my hair in an old cotton T-shirt and leave until my hair is about 75% dry and let the rest air dry

I do recommend this hair product as it defines the curls without having that crunchiness and also makes them really soft. I also use a home made hair oil for my scalp and hair which I use once a week as a hair mask and leave in overnight which I tend to put in the day before wash day!"

Taurpy,kh77e8,"SERIOUS PROBLEM! Curls went Straight!&&&Hi everyone! I (17F) used to have curls that were I believe 3A, low porosity, but over the years it‚Äôs become straight and wavy and it‚Äôs making me feel very depressed and a bit stressed. I‚Äôve used the following products but they don‚Äôt work for me: Pantene, Cantu, Head and Shoulders, Shea Moisture, Maui Moisture. Every time I wash my hair, it feels/looks unwashed. I feel like my hair has thinned and I want to revive my curls any way how.

Can you please tell me what‚Äôs wrong or recommend me products that can restore them? Thank you so much!&&&Yeah I‚Äôve gone through a lot of stress this year, and being stuck indoors definitely hasn‚Äôt helped. Sadly my parents won‚Äôt let me get prof help, so I‚Äôm on my own for that. And what are some products that‚Äôd help?&&&I put Maui Shampoo and Conditioner, though I think it‚Äôs too heavy because they‚Äôre creamy in texture. And I‚Äôve also used some gel for my hair recently and it‚Äôs made it really poofy and curly but only temporarily. And I got a short haircut I believe last month."
Winterblood21,kh77e8,I use sulfate free shampoo. It‚Äôs a lot gentler on curly hair!
elrineswag,kh77e8,"Hey! So a few questions. How many products are you putting on your hair? I've noticed that if I put any creams on my hair out of the shower it sits on my hair and looks greasy. Also, how long has it been since you got a hair cut? I was surprised how much curlier my hair became after getting the split ends cut!"
oleblueeyes75,kh77e8,"OK, breathe. Have you had any dietary changes or health issues....new birth control...change of school or employment...family or relationship issues...

2020 has sucked big time. Just that stress alone could be messing with your hair. Sulfate free products are definitely the way to go. I would suggest that you seek professional help. 

Hang in there."

RedheadedCyclone,kh63q2,"Unscented leave-in conditioner?&&&I am new to having curly hair. I am kind of desperately looking for a leave-in conditioner that does not have a scent. I have tried all sorts of products, but they all have such strong scents and I am super sensitive. 

I have super dry hair and a psoriasis dry scalp, so I can handle some pretty heavy moisture. I tend towards more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù products and I‚Äôm willing to put some money into a product that will really work.

Liv_NB,kh614d,"What's your hair porosity? 

Coconut oil is a funny one. It can be really good for some people but if your hair is dry, stiff, brittle or coarse its best to stay away from it as it can cause breakage. (Google coconut oil bad for hair if this sounds like you, apparently it can cause protein build up)

Personally I have stopped using coconut oil and instead use curl creams. I never fully wash out my conditioner in the shower and then apply curl cream as I found it thicker and more moisturising than the leave ins I tried. I also reapply a little on refresh.

Also as the other person commented, regular trims are essential if you have split ends to stop it splitting further up the shaft 

If you don't want to frequently pay for haircuts, I recommend the pigtail cut that Manes by Mell has videos for (I have cut my own hair for years)."
SamiaIslam1,kh614d,"How to best moisturise hair between washes?&&&So I have 2b hair that‚Äôs quite dry especially at the ends. I find that my hair splits very fast. As a result, I‚Äôve been trying to keep my hair as moisturised as possible to prevent some of the split ends. I usually use coconut oil everyday or every other day to moisturise my hair but I wanted to know if leave in conditioner would be better? Or a combination of both? What do you guys think?&&&Low porosity, I believe. My hair pretty much stays at the top when I put it in a glass of water. & yeah, I make sure to trim my hair very regularly. Quality is more important to me than length"
