wyldcardsam,n8uxnm,Hair is finally controllable.&&&&&&My hair care routine is washing with the bounce curl wash once a week then going in with their deep conditioner and letting it sit while I finish showering. Then letting it dry for 20-30mins and going in with the curlessence leave in conditioner. And on no wash days I substitute twice a week for the bounce curl cleansing conditioner and regular wash out conditioner with the same leave in.
Babyjitterbug,n8ucmd,"As a wavie, I find that Shea Moisture products are too heavy for my hair and I needed to switch to a stronger-hold gel.  I also need to clarify and deep condition every 3 weeks to month.  I use Ouidad‚Äôs Climate Cintrol shampoo and conditioner and Curlsmith Curl Defining Styling Souffl√©. I‚Äôll sometimes add in Ouidad‚Äôs leave-in conditioner too."
Pixie2343,n8ucmd,"Which Olaplex was it? Have you done a clarifying wash since? Not all of them are cg friendly, could be build up?"
clairolistener,n8ucmd,"try using a shampoo with sulfates (i know, i know, but just once will be fine) or perhaps using a scalp massager or scalp scrub to clarify. olaplex claims to use water-soluble silicones but personally i'm skeptical. like others have said it could be build-up, especially if you don't normally clarify your scalp. good luck!"
jacmarko,n8ucmd,"I can‚Äôt get my waves to hold. Details in comments.&&&&&&Thank you!! I‚Äôll check out those products.&&&It was #1 and #2 done in a salon. I‚Äôve clarified since, but maybe I need to do it again?&&&Thanks! I‚Äôll try using a scalp massager next time I clarify!&&&Current Routine: 
Shampoo with Shea Moisture
Condition with Herbal Essences
Leave in - Shea Moisture Smoothie
Gel - Garnier Curl Treat
I plop for a 15 minutes or so then diffuse. 

I had an Olaplex stand alone treatment 2 weeks ago as well as a cut. Since then it seems like my curl will not hold at all. I‚Äôve done various methods for applying products - dripping wet or damp or both. By the end of wash day the front is basically straight, but the ends are wavy. I have to do a full wet refresh on Day 2 using Cake Mousse. Day 3 I don‚Äôt even bother trying to get a wave or curl.

Any suggestions on application methods or different products? Did Olaplex kill my waves??"

lilydawgette,n8ucmd,"Hi, sometimes I use too much product and it weighs down my hair. You might try using less. I never use a towel, just scrunch it in the shower a little. Then I do all the usual and then use a tee to micro plop. 
Olaplex does make my hair soft but by the next wash it's good. Hope this helps."
IIIThreat,n8t463,"üÜï Product combo!&&&&&&ROUTINE: I got in a new cream gel that I wanted to try, so I co-washed (my last shampoo was four days ago) with Mizani True Textures Moisture Replenish Conditioner, then originally styled with just Scotch Porter Twist & Curl Gel Cream. I used way too much (a little goes a long way with this product, even on kinky-curly hair like mine), so - when it was halfway dry - I realized it was going to be a mess. I re-wet my hair just enough so as to not rinse out all the previous gel, then topped the Scotch Porter with Mizani True Textures Perfect Coil Oil Gel. I sat back under the dryer, and this is what it looked like at about 85% dry. 

I‚Äôll try the Scotch Porter again, using a lot less product, and see if it works by itself because this past time was‚Ä¶not great. I saved it, though! üòÖ&&&Thank you! All na-tu-rall! üòõüë®üèø‚Äçü¶≥ I started going gray at 17 (I‚Äôm almost 40 now).&&&Thank you!"

AuroraBlue6,n8srfc,"I couldn‚Äôt say what‚Äôs causing the smell, but you can try changing shampoos. Head and Shoulders isn‚Äôt the only dandruff shampoo. Have you tried any of the others?

https://www.prevention.com/beauty/hair/g19876075/best-dandruff-shampoo/"
Liv_NB,n8srfc,"Are you doing wet refreshes? Sometimes that can cause a smell.

In terms of dandruff, As I Am Dry and Itchy Shampoo works really well for me but I also have good results from Nizarol or T Gel (but it stinks) if I'm using sulphates 

[This](https://youtu.be/wGP2L7a4yNI) Manes by Mell video was so interesting about what active Ingredients to be looking for depending on what your scalp condition is

As I Am has Pyrithione Zinc, Nizarol has Ketoconozale, T Gel has coal tar, Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength has Selenium Sulphide and Alpecin Anti Dandruff Double Effect Shampoo has Salicylic Acid.

My sister and I both struggle with our scalps so we use a mixture of the products above but it was interesting to learn about the active Ingredients and why one might work better than the other.

It may be just not the right product for your dandruff."
bipolar-butterfly,n8srfc,"Are you using original or a scented version? I noticed a smell with the original, but not the green apple scent."
kindly_fuck_offff,n8srfc,"Head and Shoulders making my scalp smell?&&&Hi all, so I used to be able to go up to 5 days between washes. I started using H&S for dandruff and it helped. But now I can go 3 days max in between washes and on the third day my scalp smells kinda gross. I'm wondering if it's the shampoo since nothing else has changed in my routine. Had anyone else had this experience? Should I stop using it? What if the dandruff comes back?&&&I have not. Thanks for the link.&&&It has a scent, can't remember which.

Hold_Effective,n8sr0f,"Is your picture of a snarl/big knot? I was getting those a lot - I was overdue for a haircut last June, and it‚Äôs just gotten worse, and so my hair had just been tying itself into awful knots. I kinda gave up and just starting cutting off any knots that were resistant to being untangled without breakage, and that seems to have helped. My hair post first shot (Pfizer) seems the same, but overall I think it‚Äôs thinned over the last year."
ManInTheIronPailMask,n8sr0f,"When it's knotted that badly, I think it's probably time to cut it out. But to avoid getting to that point, I use Kinky-Curly Knot Today along with my usual shine and hold products. That, and using a Wet (brand) brush instead of a rigid wide-tooth comb (except when necessary) has improved my knot and tangle resistance, I think."

gobucksthrowaway,n8s98v,"If you are comfortable with doing so, I highly encourage you to (at minimum) email the salon owner if there is one and describe your experience with this stylist. You can also leave a public review and mention this stylist *by name.* You live with your hair every day, so you not only know what it does and does not need more than someone who is cutting/styling it once, but you also have to deal with the consequences. Anyone providing a service must be open to feedback about that service, especially when it has such an impact on confidence and self-image. I‚Äôm very sorry you had that experience."
imissmygato,n8s98v,"I have no advise for you except I do offer rage that she flat ironed WET HAIR even beyond your request for jo flat iron! I did that once when I was 15! It did so much damage it took me months to undo it and that was before I found groups like this one with better ideas than ""guess I'll wait"""
rebeccaintheclouds,n8s98v,"My hairstylist completely disregarded my request for no hair iron use and damaged my hair&&&I‚Äôm so frustrated and I have a feeling this sub would understand. I went to the hairstylist to get my hair done for a fancy event. I try to use heat on my hair very sparingly because I know how damaging it could be. And when I do, (this is no more than several times a year) I always make sure to avoid hair irons at all costs, instead opting for the blow dryer (used close to my hair with a good brush) to achieve the straightening effect. I find it causes way less damage to my hair than the iron. I also always use a heat protectant product to prevent damage. 

Anyway, long story short I told the woman what I wanted and asked her to please not use a hair iron. She started arguing with me that irons were the only way to achieve a straight look and it was fine etc etc etc. I told her my hair is susceptible to damage and I did not want the hair iron. I told her I didn‚Äôt mind a slight wave. I should also mention here that my hair takes a long time to blow dry straight but with time and patience the effects are great, it looks natural and has that slight wave. So it seemed like the woman accepted that and reached for the hair tools. 

To my disbelief she takes the hair iron and proceeds to start straightening my wet hair (I had taken a shower right before going to the salon). I was horrified and told her I did not want it and she laughed it off and said don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll see it‚Äôll be fine. I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene so I just stayed quiet and hoped for the best. Soon the air smelled like hair frying and I asked her politely to please not use this tool and instead blow dry my hair using a blower. Again she brushed it off and proceeded to tell me stories of how quickly she could straighten hair and how many years she‚Äôs been doing it for and how much experience she has etc etc etc. When I asked her if she‚Äôd put some heat protectant product she said I didn‚Äôt need it but when I insisted she reached over to some leave in conditioner and put on a bit. The bottle looked old and unused. I sat in my chair trying not to express my frustration and just wanting this hair frying session to be over.

That night I looked at my hair and assessed the damage. The ends were dry and coarse. My hair did not feel like all those other times when I‚Äôd just used a blow dryer with a heat protectant product. I thought maybe once I‚Äôd shower my hair would bounce back but it didn‚Äôt. The curl pattern just wasn‚Äôt the same. I put in a lot of conditioner and product but it didn‚Äôt help much. 

It‚Äôs been several months now and I‚Äôm still trying to get my hair to bounce back. I‚Äôm so disappointed and frustrated. I wish hairstylist would respect their client‚Äôs wishes, especially curly haired people. I wish they wouldn‚Äôt impose the ‚Äòstandard‚Äô hair treatment just because ‚Äòit works for everybody else‚Äô. 

If you read till here, thank you! Please let me know if you‚Äôve had similar experiences. 

TLDR; my hairdresser completely disregarded my request and instead used whatever tools she felt like and caused damage to my hair.&&&Hey thank you! The truth is I feel bad leaving a review, and it‚Äôs a smallish type salon anyway and I don‚Äôt want to drive away business. 
What bothers me most about this story is not being taken seriously. I‚Äôve been living with my hair for a lot longer than the stylist knows me, and just because she has ‚Äòexperience‚Äô, doesn‚Äôt mean she knows my hair needs better than I do. Especially with curly hair, it‚Äôs frustrating how little knowledge people have about it.&&&I haven‚Äôt tried a protein treatment, although that‚Äôs a great idea and I‚Äôll definitely look into it. I recently ordered the Marc Anthony deep hydrating mask and I‚Äôm looking forward to trying that and see what happens. I also got a new gel and hair mousse. 

Any particular recommendations for protein treatments? Thank you!&&&Sadly I can relate:( heat iron + wet hair is a terrible combination."
shattered_illusions,n8s98v,"I am sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately there are far too many incompetent hair dressers out there. These butchers used to destroy my hair back in the day when I was too young and scared to object.

Lacathouille,n8r42g,"Your bangs look great! We have similar hair (I think), getting bangs right is still very hard. Will try to get them on as the very last step before hair dry as you do. Who knows? :3"
PerkyLurkey,n8r42g,"Ok, your bangs look great. Really good, especially since curly bangs are so hard to pull off! But you definitely pull them off just fine!

We have almost the same routine, except I brush out my hair before conditioning, with a denman, and then ultra squish to condish, and squish to rinse as well.

I really love your bangs look, and wish mine would look that good, but I‚Äôve tried it once, and sadly, mine didn‚Äôt look as good as yours do.

Congrats!"
gnomesofdreams,n8r42g,"Almost one month since going for curly bangs at home, and I don‚Äôt regret it one bit. Glad I took the risk!&&&&&&About me/my hair:

Been trying cg for almost 2 years now I think? I‚Äôd had bleached hair from some navy & dark purple dye jobs years back and my curls were really, really hurting. I decided to try cg to care for it as I grew it out. That hair finally grew all out/got trimmed out by my last professional hair cut, which by the grace of god was right before lockdown in my area, ~March 2020. I‚Äôve been growing it out and have been bored, but don‚Äôt want to bleach or cut it all, and everyone‚Äôs quarantine bangs had me really jealous!

I‚Äôve had bangs several times before: all really badly. As a young child (Before curls, but I have a massive cowlick above right eye so like a gigantic chunk was missing), in middle school (early 2000s, kept hair curly but straightened my bangs every day ayo, still had awful cowlick), and in college: just a single little mini bang in the front that I cut myself while studying abroad when I was also bored. I was convinced these bangs would be just as bad but, tbh, I just did not care. I‚Äôm bored, it‚Äôs hair, and I rarely see anyone these days anyway. Waited very long (after buying proper shears and a successful DIY trim using double unicorn method) to finally pull the trigger, but finally did! And I LOVE how they turned out. I honestly like their imperfections for being home cut probably all the more, because they rarely dry the same way twice and my hair doesn‚Äôt have the most definition or tightest curl pattern in the first place, so I feel like variable ‚Äúwho knows what you‚Äôll get‚Äù nature is the whole vibe that I‚Äôm leaning into. 

It‚Äôs also worth adding that I did not cut these alone or really by myself- my wonderful boyfriend held the scissors 85% of the time on both the at-home unicorn trim and on these. We cut these after watching some YouTube videos- did full wash & style first (routine below), then cut dry, and cut very slow, and long and with no face framing layers. We then brought them up and added some face framing bits the next weekend once I‚Äôd seen how I liked them and they acted - so only first pic is after that trim, other two bangs pics are when they were still longer. Tbh I liked their U shape more before the trim, so I‚Äôll probably try to shape them back like that a little whenever I trim next. I was expecting to hate them and start growing them out immediately, but I‚Äôm excited to keep them around at least all summer! 


Routine:

Wash every ~3-5 days, alternate between As I Am Dry & Itchy shampoo and another other shampoo I‚Äôm trying to use up that I don‚Äôt like much (I have...three? Dippity Do curls, and old Deva Curl low or no poo, and Not Your Mothers curl talk- I still don‚Äôt feel like I have a shampoo I love :/). Occasionally use a shampoo brush thing if not lazy. Rinse, condition with Tresemme. Do a lazy squish to condish or generally only half rinse out.

Variations: If my seb dermatisis is really bad, shampoo/clarify with Rx ketaconazole shampoo, but I haven‚Äôt had to do this really since switching to As I Am! If I used Rx shampoo or something not cg/clarifying, or roughly 1x every 2 months, use Garnier mask instead, or some old Shea Moisture or Cantu leave in I‚Äôm slowly using up. And if I‚Äôm washing my hair back to back days (sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt feel like a shower unless I get my whole hair wet?) maybe co-wash with and old NYM curl talk conditioner instead of shampooing. (Stopped using that as conditioner bc I don‚Äôt think my hair likes protein much.)

Either flip hair upside down or just generally keep off my back while I exit shower and put on a towel. While dripping wet, loose praying hands in a bit of garnier mask, then a quarter or half dollar of curlsmith Creme. (I LOVE the curlsmith cream!). Then either immediately do a rough sweep with a denman brush, or add a little bit of gel (today I did the herbal essences gel I‚Äôm trying to use up) and then denman. After denman, apply some gel (usually aunt Jackie‚Äôs flax, have really liked this! Or eco olive oil) and scrunch with hands, then scrunch out excess moisture with t shirt and really really loosely tie back in T-shirt while I put clothes on, remove ASAP and let air dry. Pull bangs forward and scrunch (adding more gel if needed) right before air dry. 

Sleep with a silk cap on night one, high pony after bc it doesn‚Äôt stay great so what‚Äôs the point.

Refresh by spritzing with water and applying a little more curlsmith and either pattern gel (got a sample, don‚Äôt love it for wash days, but love it for refreshes??) or miss Jessie‚Äôs jelly soft curls. 

Still figuring out my routine, the denman is new but I think I like it? But I‚Äôm too lazy to try to really use it properly. I also hate diffusing bc of the time it takes, and refuse to unless I‚Äôm going out in winter when it will freeze otherwise- so I think I‚Äôm always assuming this is as good as my hair gets without diffusing. Always taking tips for how to make it better (without diffusing.) Latest struggle is just general frizz, so if anyone has tips there, I‚Äôll take them. 

This is a really long comment so I think that‚Äôs it! Wanted to share my journey esp in case anyone else is thinking of bangs or not.&&&Thank you! And that‚Äôs fascinating about when you brush, I might try that. I have been trying to figure out the balance of when to brush vs apply product, what I have a think is fine, but will be curious to see if that feels or works better! Ty for sharing it!"

EllieRae710,n8o9a9,"You might also want to try being aware of which direction you're brushing the curl clumps. If you're brushing straight out from the scalp or straight up, you're going to end up with more root life. Try brushing some layers more downward to get a little less volume."
