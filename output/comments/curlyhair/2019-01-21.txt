PrettyPrettyTrini,akjmrm,"Still transitioning from heat and color damage. Any tips on how to keep curls intact overnight? I wear a bonnet and they still never stay!&&&&&&Thank you! Ill try that!&&&Okay! I usually just stuff it in there. But tonight I put it on upside down and I think that may be comparable! &&&My curl routine on wash days:

Washing:
Shea Moisture coconut hibscus shampoo 
Aphogee curlific texture treatment
After rinsing, I leave on some Shea Moisture coconut hibiscus conditioner(regular)

I towel dry my hair and when itâ€™s damp I use:
Leave in, liquid form
CurlyKids Mixed Texture Haircare: creamy curl lotion
OGX Bonding Plex Bonding Cream (restores my curls 100%)
Shea Moisture coconut hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie 
-I scrunch in all of these products until itâ€™s dry, and then when itâ€™s completely dry, I oil my scalp with Castor Oil Butter w/Coconut Oil. "
crab-gf,akjmrm,"if you donâ€™t â€˜pineappleâ€™ your hair inside the bonnet iâ€™d try that. i donâ€™t do the bun part of it, only the ponytail and i noticed a change in curl definition overnight. "
dumbroad,akjmrm,Get a spray bottle and spritz with water (or water with a small amount of product mixed in) in the morning to refresh
lilone0818,akjkk3,"After my first rice water rinse&&&&&&Today was just a hair pampering day. Started off with putting a mix of jcbo on my scalp and coconut oil on my ends. Left that on for about an hour with a heated cap to help open my cuticles. Then did a rice water rinse and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Definitely let the rice boil for a little too long and the water got much thicker than I wanted it to, so I diluted it with some tap water. Then used the mielle deep conditioner (non-protein) and let that sit for 20ish minutes. Rinsed that out, S2C with devacurl conditioner, then layered in devacurl bâ€™leave-in, Cantu curl activator and miss Jessieâ€™s soft curls gel (quarter sized amount of each) using the praying hands method. Plopped for 10 min, diffused for 20 min and then let it air dry for 2 hours. Scrunched out the crunch with argan oil. Really happy with how shiny and healthy it looks. 
Wishlist for next time: more volume at the top of my head and I wish the curls were less...clumpy? The clumping makes my hair look thinner because there are random gaps. Any suggestions are very much appreciated!"

lizlemons,akjj4i,"Last January a stylist chemically burned off about 1/2 my hair. Iâ€™m finally removing my extensions and cutting to the new growths length on Friday, and these little ringlets are giving me hope :)&&&&&&Aw yis, the most quotable show ever!! Thank you, I'm glad too:) Ready to leave the dead (hair) weight behind&&&[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/wwYU0Bs) a pic of my hair with the new growth vs. old super damaged hair, if anyone was curious about what it looks like (also, it's brushed out in the pic so it's looking extra yikes!).

My routine:

Every other day, or more likely every few days-

\-Brush out before bed and showers because it's horribly tangly and can't handle no brushing

\-Sheamoisture moisture retention shampoo, or ACV Hue Apple Cider Vinegar hair rinse

\-Sheamoisture moisture retention conditioner, I use a ton and squish it in

\-carefully squeeze w towel (considering getting a microfiber, not sure if they're worth it)

\- sheamoisture castor oil leave in conditioner, squished in

\-shea oil, also squished

\-air dry

&#x200B;

After the cut I'm going to start using the Deva Curl gel and see if I can finally achieve the beautiful, healthy, curly hair that all of yall have!!! "
LaceySaysHi,akj5za,"New growth or broken hair?&&&&&&Hi curlies :) 

I've been doing proper cg method since September. After yeeeears of heat straightening, I finally committed to embracing my curls and it's been going well I think. 
I use all cg approved products and deep condition once per week. I don't wear it in tight pony tails or anything but I now have all these baby hairs around my hairline.  I'm scared it's breaking but I don't know how that could be possible since I'm for the first time in my life taking care of it. 
Help?! "
rivalpiper,akj5za,"It's probably new growth. Broken hair would break around a stress point, like where it tangles or where you wear a ponytail. Since hair near the roots has to be relatively young and healthy it would be the least likely to break there."
kittenflan,akir1x,"Day 1 of CG, so happy so far!! Routine in comments&&&&&&Clarified with VO5 Extra Body Volumizing Shampoo and rinsed. 

Conditioned with TreSemme Botanique Nourish and Replenish Conditioner. I detangled my hair with a wide tooth comb, then a denman brush that I removed two rows of teeth from. 

While in the shower, I turn my hair on either side of my head, and S2C as I rinse the conditioner, and left some on my hair (I canâ€™t go completely upside down it tangles my hair). 

Once out of the shower, I scrunched my hair with a cotton t shirt until it wasnâ€™t dripping wet, then added two large handfuls of Herbal Essences Totally Twister Curl Boosting Mousse. I scrunched with the cotton shirt, then diffused on cool until 70% dry. I crunched the scrunch once it was completely dry.

Hellerado,akimg2,It looks great!
Sixela781,akimg2,"This looks so good! My hair is usually super straight but it was basically curly, kinda like what you have on the left picture ! I wish I could get those back these products really worked on you :) "
SuzieMac15,akimg2,You can also look on naturally curly.com under the stylist search.
kiwifruit211,akimg2,Wow! Had no idea a deva cut could have such a huge effect. My hair looks similar to your before photo so I might need to try a cut ðŸ¤”
lizhgnz,akimg2,It looks so good!!!
music_librarian,akimg2,"Before and After my first Deva Cut! Iâ€™ve struggled my whole life with my hair and Iâ€™m happy to finally be on the right track.&&&&&&I havenâ€™t started the routine yet but here are the products my hair stylist used/recommended for me:

Low Poo Delight

One condition Delight

B-Leave In

Arc angel Gel

Edit: These are all Deva Curl products. She also defused my hair with the Dyson hair dyer. I really want to get one now!&&&Thank you so much. My hair has constantly been a struggle for me and this haircut is a big win for me. Iâ€™ve been growing out a pixie cut for 2 years now and I told myself if I didnâ€™t learn how to wear my hair natural this year Iâ€™m gonna chop it all off. But Iâ€™m doing my best to take everything the stylist taught me! &&&Do it! You will not regret. This is one of my go to outfits, all Iâ€™m missing is my gold broach. &&&I went to a local salon in Orlando! I found her my scrolling through instagram and she was super nice and helpful. Really educated me throughout the whole process"
theleahgend,akimg2,Do you mind my asking where you went to get the cut? Or did you do it yourself? I want a curly cut but Iâ€™m not sure where to go.
weighwardho,akimg2,"Oh man, I used to rock the sh!t out of a good ribbed turtleneck. I think youâ€™ve convinced me to reignite that flame. Thank you! The cut looks great, too!"
minniesnowtah,akikht,"BRAND NEW International Product List!&&&[Here's the list!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vTbVtl5RKQyRwtOlctXVt4f8HovDNVjRUkXBMt3l_DpnkSS0Q-wQ3d77_nf20EJ2yPEFpsuvb6Aa52c/pubhtml#)

&#x200B;

There are now **31 countries and regions** on the list! Thank you to all the people who recommended products! (And those who caught mistakes/reformulations, I think it's all up to date now!)

&#x200B;

**What changed?**

* It's now in a google spreadsheet instead of google docs (easier to view by country & to update)
* You can submit products either [individually](https://goo.gl/forms/GDY4LEZo7U9LICtl1) OR [in bulk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16SBWhfEm3jmFYB1JtXCHMCrKhw2BcetqR6LCIgcTg5Q/edit#gid=0)
* Beginner routines can be created for any country!

&#x200B;

**Why did you redo the list?**

* Inconsistencies between countries
* VERY difficult to update due to disorganization!
* Hard for people to submit new products
* With so many countries, it was getting ridiculously hard to find the right info

&#x200B;

**Are you going to redo the US list too?**

* Maybe! Let us know if you prefer this format (or the old one) and would like to see changes."
Millz118,akiboo,"I still have curls! So far so good!&&&&&&My hair I think itâ€™s 2a? Iâ€™ve heat styled so much I think itâ€™s hard for me to tell. When I wash it if I donâ€™t actively try to curl it, itâ€™ll dry to a straight/loose wave but with the CG method it looks healthier but I still see the frizz And some straighter strands than others. I have trouble with moisture since itâ€™s so thin, literally everything weighs it down! Itâ€™s also stringy but I used a Curl specific gel from Hask and it seems to have helped with definition!Itâ€™s been a month and Iâ€™m lazy curly girl inâ€™ my way through 2019! I did my clarifying process at the beginning of the month as instructed to start but Iâ€™ve used the shampoo more often because of my fine, thin hair I get tons of buildup! 

I donâ€™t use anything special, just Vo5 shampoo to clarify and Suave coconut to condition. I mostly wash once a week(lazy) and if not clarifying Iâ€™ll just condition but I should get a better routine. 

I love spray leave-ins and looking for a good rec for one thatâ€™s water based, good for waves/curls and affordable.  

Also, whatâ€™s a good idea for next day hair, I shower at night and have had no luck just ending up in an ugly pony tail. My hair is in pony tail a lot because again, Iâ€™m lazy but when I try gosh darn itâ€™s cute! "
Tcole518,akiboo,pineapple at night for sure helps! also coming up with a good refresh routine... if you like spray leave-ins that would be a great thing to use to refresh your curls
Tcole518,akiakb,do you squish go condish? maybe plopping could also help get those front pieces. 
not2reddit,akiakb,"Over gelâ€™ed?&&&&&&I used more gel than usual today to try and help second day hair but my hair is pretty much dry and I scrunched already and my hair looks and feels kinda wet and a little sticky. Did I over gel?

Also I am not sure what kind of curl type I am but the front pieces of my hair never curl :/ no idea how to fix that.&&&Routine- currently have to use a sulfate free tea tree shampoo for a skin condition. Then I cowash and condition with the tresseme botanique conditioner. 
I flip hair and finger comb then scrunch in deva curl gel. Air dry."
Manteam111,akhw24,"Keep losing my curls!&&&&&&So, I started the curly girl method about a month ago, and I have curls that have started forming. But whenever I run my fingers through them during my ""Styling"" step, they turn into frizz. Then, I have to pick out each individual curl and that takes 10-15 mins. Should I be doing something different for my type of hair?

(The pic is of my hair BEFORE I try and style. This is it right out of the shower.)&&&(Sorry about the late reply. I work a customer service job ðŸ˜¬) I co-wash with Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner and then re-apply that conditioner for the rest of my shower. Rinse it out with cold water and hop out of the shower. Then, I attempt to ""style"" it with Eco Olive Oil Gel. But my hair just turns to frizz when I put my fingers through it. "
Theroundtrees_3,akhw24,What's your routine?
duckorrabbit69,akhkz3,"Good luck!! I don't have short hair so I'm not much help with tips, but I would just advise if you're starting CG from scratch then start with some basic products from the beginner list, and don't bother to with expensive products at the start, because it's all about experimenting and finding the product and routine that works for you! "
thesciencebitch,akhkz3,"Starting today!!&&&I have very short hair.  Like 3 inches long at the front and less in the back.   My hair used to have beautiful curls at even shoulder length but 3 babies, 8 years and lots of exhaustion has changed my hair!  

I usually shower at night and wet my hair in the morning to allow my curls to bounce back after sleeping on them at night. 

Any advice on how to manage hair when you shower at night and sleeping flattens the curls?  I only wash 2x a week but I usually rewet my hair every morning or else it looks like a flat fluffy mom cut!   

My goal is to just have nicer looking curls. Not perfect because my hair is so short. Just want it to look prettier.   And Iâ€™ll chop it off for summer probably too!  It gets warm in the south US in March  :)

Starting the reset wash tonight!!  "
-HuangMeiHua-,akhfsy,"Wavy day!&&&&&&2A-3A/High Porosity/Medium Density/Coarse

Todayâ€™s Routine:

1. Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo @ scalp

2. Detangle with Tresemme Botanique Nourish & Replenish 

3. Comb Kinky Curly Knot Today through hair as leave in 

4. Braid until 65-70% dry, then let curls take over"
ceruleansensei,akh5vu,"CG approved ketoconazole shampoo?&&&I'm on my dermatology rotation right now and we are prescribing ketoconazole shampoo (2% is prescription strength, 1% is OTC) left and right for different scalp and hair problems, including male pattern hair loss! This seems like such a great thing that helps out a ton of people, I'd like to recommend it to my patients, but I noticed the OTC brand Nizoral has harsh sulfates in it. I'd hate for people to have to choose between their scalp health and their hair. Anyone here who's needed to use ketoconazole shampoo before have any suggestions? 

&#x200B;

According to the ingredient bots I don't think it contains any silicones. Perhaps then this could be used as a clarifying shampoo for curlies who need it? It is only recommended to be used up to 3x a week, daily use is not recommended. 

Thanks!"
lilyeye618,akh5vu,"I use the prescription strength once a week and do a careful deep condition after, no problems so far. I'm really careful to avoid conditioning my scalp too much because I have sebbhoratic psoriasis. The ketoconazole makes a world of difference!"
rizorith,akh5vu,Try regenpure hair and scalp treatment. It's on Amazon. Has 1 percent ketocanazole
