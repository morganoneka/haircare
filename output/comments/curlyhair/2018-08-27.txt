betsaronie,9chuff,"Sally's generic version of the Matrix biolage is my holy grail product. it's $7 for a giant bottle that lasted me about 5 months.  so def try that if you love Matrix.  I think some products are worth it and some aren't it's been try and error to figure out.  i also really like the pantene curl mousse, nice and cheap.  But i can't find a cheap gel that works for me.  I'm mop top custard or Kinky Curly Curling Custard all the way.  i say save money where you can, there's tons of great cheap options out there, but if you find an awesome pricey product and you think it's worth the money, go for it."
i_luv_u_5-evur,9chuff,Which salon brands are worth the purchase? Which are not?&&&I‚Äôm about three weeks into CG but I‚Äôve been using matrix biolage as my conditioner for a couple years. I think it detangles well but it wasn‚Äôt quite enough moisture on its own. Has anyone else tried it?
CaliforniaJade,9chc0x,"Hormones.  Your hair is what it is now.  Seems to be the nature of curly hair, never exactly the same twice.  "
radical_radish55,9chc0x,"How do i get my tight and hard afro-y hair back? Its too soft and not as curly anymore.&&&Back when i was a kid i had these awesome superhard curls that when theyd grow long look like i have dreadlocks.

Fast forward to middle school time i wanted to make my hair straight and combable so id regularly shampoo it as much as i could and comb it for up to hours on end. it used to take me 3 years like this until i could KINDA comb my hair because the comb would always get stuck in my hair cause it was super resistant, and i had a really bomb afro of super tight and frizzy curls (thats how i actually love it, i dont like very defined curls).

So i did that for 5 years straight and had my hair cut some times in and it eventually grew to have the back be pretty much STRAIGHT like a line and my front be wavy.

Since i turned 17, close to 18 i learned to appreciate my natural afro-y curls again. so i stopped combing alltogether, read up some stuff learned about how bad silicone shampoos and such are and for about almost 2 years now i guess ive been washing my hair as much as i could with natural shampoo and for half a year now ive been washing my hair everyday only with water. When i was young i had a full afro cause i never  cared about looks but now i do and i shave my sides completely and leave the top up.

My curls have come back mostly especially around the front and back, but the sides and top have become very problematic as they get about twice as uncurly as my front and back hair. id say back then i had a full head of 3c / 4a curls and now i get 3c curls around the front and back if im lucky and 3a curls on the sides and around the middle part of my head. im not sure if its because i have no hair on the sides to support these parts (might be a bad cut?) or if i possibly outcombed my curls and they just cant grow anymore like they used to? and what i also dont like is how weak they are now. when theyre wet AND dry i can comb them straight with little resistance, when i was a kid and had my natural curls it was pretty much impossible to comb them even when they were wet. and when my hair is dry now, its very soft and fluffy like a girls hair, when i was a kid it was extremely dry and hard and ""spongy"" i guess? dam i miss my old afro hair. i could wear helmets for like half a day and it would puff right back up into an afro. nowadays if i wear as much as a hat they get straightened down like 2 curl type levels atleast. any advice on what to do? im thinking of going back to how i used to wash my hair as a kid with those sulfate silicon shampoos but im not sure if that would just further destroy my curls.

or maybe its my hair length? i cut it a second time after going natural a few days ago and it seems whenever i cut them short they get less curly and the more they grow the curlier they get. i had extremely long hair when it was like this and my hair now is much shorter. but i feel like its more than just that."
RomyReptile,9ch7ka,Feeling the curls today&&&&&&My usual routine is - Condition with Shea Moisture Curl Conditioner twice a week. I apply Jamaican Black Castor Oil & Argan Oil once a week and leave over night. After washing hair I usually just scrunch and plop for 20 mins. This style was done using Shea Moisture Leave In Conditioner.&&&It's mainly the women that comment how lucky I am lol and how they would kill for curls like mine. Dude's don't seems to care haha.
wildferalfun,9ch7ka,Looks fantastic. How often do you hear how lucky you are? My dad had hair longer than mine and my mom's for most of my childhood and people fawned all over him about his curls. Now my hair is long enough to sit on and people comment on the curls too!
emfer19,9cfy5w,"Best hair day in a while&&&&&&Routine:

SnozberryWallpaper,9cftyb,"I can't speak for all curlies, but in my experience it's trial and error. And it doesn't really stop even if you've found great products because curly hair is temperamental and tends to be reactive to all the ways your environment changes. Hormones also play a role, and those are ever fluctuating too. I have mostly 3A curls and the gels I've come to love are ArcAngel by Devacurl and Biotera from Sally's. Clarifying as often as necessary with Cantu's sulfate free shampoo helps the products all work better in my case as well! 

Others swear by ECOstyler gel and L.A.Looks, but I've not tried those personally!&&&Should've asked also, what was the curl cream you ran out of and why wasn't it a home run? Might help to suss out your hair's preferences!

Edit: Reading comprehension dummy moment"
allofthespices,9cftyb,"Like the other commenter said, Ulta has a fantastic return policy if you don't like the product. Also, there are plenty of low-cost brands out there. I did a bunch of research on this subreddit and watched a bunch of videos before deciding what to buy. I would suggest starting with a leave-in and a hard hold gel. Great cheaper option for those two are the As I Am Leave In and the LA Looks Extreme Sport Gel. Once you figure out what your hair likes, you can start looking at adding in a curl cream or curl enhancing gel."
amandaunbidden,9cftyb,"The good thing about Ulta is that you can return the product if it doesn‚Äôt work for you. Even the small travel sizes. That‚Äôs often what I do. If I want to try something new, I buy it there and then just return it if I don‚Äôt like it. 

"
feisty_nerd,9cftyb,"I am a Deva Curl scared girl&&&I went into ULTA today to bite the bullet and finally replace the awful curl cream I already had. After looking at my options, I got really nervous. I've been on this sub for long enough to know that I have curly hair, but not frequently enough to figure out my curl type. 

I know my old curl cream (RIP) was okay but not perfect for my hair. At ULTA I finally confronted that there are so many options, but they are all so EXPENSIVE. I ultimately bought a Deva Curl light curl gel travel bottle (for $10 mind you) and I'm wondering how you guys decided what product from what brand would be right for you? I don't want to spend a huge amount of money on something I'm not sure is right for my hair. How did you make the decision?"
nemicolopterus,9cftyb,"This is exactly why we have the super cheap Quickstart routine! It links to a short list of products that are super cheap and easy to get.

LemonMIntCat,9cf0fi,Omg you are like my hair style goals. Mine always looks so triangular instead of the nice rounded out shape. You said you cut your hair yourself but do you know kind of what that type of cut is called?

sillymonkeyhead,9cex94,"About a month in! Really starting to love the results.&&&&&&Routine: Wash with Shae Moisture Low Porosity shampoo (about once per week) and then squish to condish with Shae Moisture Low Porosity conditioner.

I usually shower in the evening specifically so I can go to bed with my hair wet-- I'll plop immediately after I add product and usually go to bed within the hour, but I sometimes am up and around for a bit longer.

My hair doesn't naturally get too oily, and I've find that leaving the product in my hair for a few days doesn't give me any problems. I just add some extra water and product to my hair in between wash days to refresh if needed, or sometimes will co-wash (wash using conditioner only). Other times I'll just put up my hair or wear a hat. 

When I first started CG and was just co-washing with the Tresemme conditioner that they recommended my hair was getting SUPER oily. After I realized that my hair was low porosity I was able to switch to a lighter product and the difference is night and day. I suggest doing some research and experimenting and you'll be able to find something that works for you! "
Curly_Edi,9cevye,"Hair victory at a wedding yesterday! The first photo is after the 12 hour party. The second is during the party. My hair behaved wonderfully!&&&&&&I used shea moisture curl shampoo. I used lots of tresseme botanique conditioner, applied by praying  hands, combed and then I did rake and shake for the first time. I used curl scrunching jelly, applied by scrunching. I plopped, diffused most of the way. Then air dried. I scrunched out the crunch after I had the dress on. "
dncewzl,9cef4q,"First Trim After Going CG... Yikes!&&&http://imgur.com/a/DyWwrdr

Pic #1 - How I left the salon... Yikes that face! 

Pic #2 - I tired to fix it. Looks better but still too wispy and no clumps

Pic #3 - How I style it on the regular ;)

My stylist is my sister in-law and I love her dearly. However I'm too passive to try and tell her how I want my hair to be done. After all, she is supposed to be a the expert on hair. I tried to hint at a couple of things like heat and product ingredients but she didn't get my subtleness. 

She used a hair brush on it before washing while it was dry. OUCH. I turned into a pile of fluff. Used sulfates and silicones while washing. While styling she raked waaaay too much and then used full heat to blow dry. Whoa frizz!

I've been going to her for years when I dyed my hair and wore it straight everyday. I typically love how it turns out, but clearly a problem here with the curls....

Just a bit of a vent / how well I know how to style my own hair now!"
julesforcoffee,9cedns,"Wash day worse than refresh day..? Info posted below.&&&&&&Hair type (as currently appears): low porosity 3B/3A/2C ok, so I‚Äôm actually really new to having curly hair. I‚Äôve had straight hair with body all my life and at the start of the year it slowly started to change curly (of corse I didn‚Äôt know what was happening for a long time, I just started out wild and with more body at the roots). I‚Äôve tried treating it curly a few times in the past without much luck as it was still straight and curly mixed. Finally it‚Äôs mostly curly and wavy so I‚Äôve been learning and working at treating it curly for about 3-4 weeks. It continues to curl and some of the wavy bits are now curling at the root. Twice now it has been more curly and better on the second day after a refresh than on wash day. Trying to figure out why and what to do about it. 
Wash  day: wash with DivaCurl no poo. Condition with divacurl one original conditioner, separating hair into three sections and raking through, then working conditioner into roots by raking all hair. Then turn upside down and squish/scrunch in. I let this sit a few minutes. I‚Äôve started rinsing the conditioner out with warm water instead of cold because I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to help my low porosity hair. I try to rinse 95% of the conditioner out. 
Then I flip back upside down and with dripping wet hair I scrunch in divacurl styling cream, (previously I would also scrunch in a little divacurl frizz-free volumizing foam next and I think it was a mistake to not do it this last time as it normally would be less frizzy and more defined if I used it) then coat the outside of my hair in divacurl ultra defining gel and scrunch that in.
I then scrunch and hold sections with a microfiber towel to get excess water absorbed. 
Hair air dries for a few minutes then I defuse every section on low blow and medium heat for 30 seconds then 10 seconds on low temperature. Defusing from ends or hair to root.
It air dries from there. I might hit a few seconds a little more with the defuser that takes forever to dry. 
I then scrunch out the crunch with a microfiber towel.

I Sleep on a silk pillow cloth and have hair in a pineapple except back under layer that is too short. 

Refresh: use a spray bottle of water to get hair wet, then use divacurl foam coating the outside of hair then using more frizz-free foam and scrunching it in. I defuse like before but less time per section probably 20 seconds then 8-10 seconds. Then I‚Äôll uses little of the divacurl hairspray and if I need to I‚Äôll spray devacurl detangle spray on my fingertips and smooth over the top of my hair to smooth frizz down. 

I know not everyone is a fan of divacurl but I thought I would stick with one brand to get started and learn as this is all new to me and my hair seems to continue to evolve. When I get an understanding of my hair I‚Äôll experiment with other brands and products.  Also, any tips on how to get that front section of curls that curl into my face cut would be nice, getting a devacut in a few weeks which should help a lot of issues. "

IanWane112,9ce71e,"Seeking guidance on where to start!&&&Hi! I'm a male living in the UK and I'm looking to start a routine soon. Problem is I have no idea which products to use or where to get them (I've always taken a more relaxed approach towards my appearance...) so I'm looking for any help/suggestions regarding which clarifying shampoo to purchase, which conditioners would be good to start with, where to buy them and any general tips and pointers you could offer. I'm willing to splash out little on good products if it's a difference of a few extra pounds for quality, but I'm sure we're all looking for a bargain!

LastOfTheMoohanicans,9ce59f,"It could be your pillow - cotton/linen can absorb the natural oils your hair produces at night, making it dryer and more brittle; as well as being a course material that could be causing breakage through friction when you turn in the night. Try a silk or satin pillowcase, wrapping your head in a silk scarf, a silk lined cap or even the gusset from a pair of cut off pantyhose for a few weeks and see if that helps."
emfer19,9ce59f,"frizz can be caused by lots of things: if the strands need moisture, if you touch it a lot while it dries or after its dried, if the styling products are applied evenly, completely or sufficiently, etc. so it can really very as to whats causing ur frizz"

After using the gel, I then apply the coconut curl Styler super cream same way as I do the gel. After applying the product, I put my hair in a microfiber towel. I go ahead and apply facial moisturizer, make up, etc.  Then I blow dry my hair mostly upside down, with a diffuser until about 80% dry.

I use an olde tymey sifter bc it has a very fine mesh and the opening fits exactly over the short glass jelly jar I keep the gel in. i add a few drops essential oil (lemon grass, tea tree, lavender right now). store in the fridge. so easy!
