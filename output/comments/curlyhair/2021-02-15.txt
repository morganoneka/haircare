Brandysheanix,lpf89n,"It‚Äôs my 1 year wavy-versary!&&&&&&After a lifetime of what I thought was straight hair, I didn‚Äôt have time to blow dry one morning and my hair started doing weird things. 

I researched like a madwoman, bought so many different products, went to a stylist who knows how to cut curly/wavy hair, and here I am a year later!  I‚Äôm still figuring out the best routine for my hair, but here is what I do currently:

NYM Curl Talk shampoo and conditioner. Squish to condish. Rinse out conditioner. While still in shower rake in devacurl styling cream and kinky curly curl custard. Use denman brush while still upside down. Micro plop with microfiber towel and then diffuse to 95% dry."
Razzmatazz-88,lpek4m,Great curls and super cute dog!
SuccsnSuch,lpek4m,"I don‚Äôt take pictures a lot, it‚Äôs hard for me to get myself to do so. Sorry I‚Äôm advance for not having better shots or pictures but I am just glad I‚Äôm taking more pictures. This has been my 17 month journey. I‚Äôm so glad I finally did this.&&&&&&My products are

Shea Moisture -Moisture retention Shampoo and Conditioner

And 

Cantu Leave in conditioner..

My routin really is trash and inconsistent, and I‚Äôm always experiment or leaving out steps. But the most part it‚Äôs I use the shampoo about 1 time a week and condition every other day or so. I always condition any day I shampoo and use a deep conditioner as well that I let sit for awhile before washing out. I also use tshirt plops to dry my hair after putting all my product in. And will use combs and fingers to try and untangle it.&&&Thank you I‚Äôm hoping to find my perfect routine soon"
mdimaline,lpek4m,Wicked curls!
niamonapope,lpek4m,Awesome curls!
supercutelisa,lpek4m,Really lovely curls!!
Sorry_K,lpejym,I‚Äôve dyed and bleached my hair so much I decided to dye it back to my natural color and give it a break. I can‚Äôt wait til it‚Äôs back to it‚Äôs healthy self üò≠&&&&&&My routine includes Shea moisture Jamaican castor oil shampoo and I use different conditioners depending on my mood. But I swear by the aphogee protein treatment! It‚Äôs helped my curls a lot after bleaching. I also use Shea moisture and paul Mitchell ‚Äútwirl around‚Äù & dry with a diffuser! My hair is very fine so the more volume the better.
SunflowerCurlz5,lpebhv,"My most recent, favorite good curl days&&&&&&I shampoo & condition with OGX thick & full, biotin & collagen. Once out of the shower but with my hair still pretty wet, I rake in my leave-in conditioner with my fingers - African Pride Moisture Miracle Coconut Oil & Baobab Oil Leave-In Cream - Provides Intense Moisture & Helps Repair Natural Coils & Curls, Hydrates & Strengthens Hair, 15 oz https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F6W3S65/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_PFNWDGHMWV6H28WK4EYE

Then I section my hair to de-tangle it fully with a wide tooth comb. (Hair is still pretty wet)
Once de-tangled, I soak up any extra water by scrunching my hair with an old tshirt (do not use a towel please, this creates frizz)

From there I let my hair air dry, and periodically (about every 30 mins) I flip my hair and lightly pick it with a hair pik as it gradually air dries. 

I hope this helps- this is my current routine! You can message me with questions. I don‚Äôt use any other products except hair spray once my hair is almost fully dried.

Also be sure to get regular trims! Every 3-4 months"

QueenC580,lpdosg,"Olaplex No. 3 Ruined my curl pattern, can anyone help?&&&&&&Thank you for your reply! It has been brittle and breaking too, I'm investing in a protein free line hopefully that helps.&&&Further info:

Virgin Hair. This change happened about half a yr ago. I evenly applied Olaplex 3, let it sit overnight, shampooed, conditioned, and deep conditioned in the morning. The result was noticeably drier, harder, and bumpier strands that seem warped. They're concentrated on the top layer of my hair if I do a middle part (rough strands like in the video) but can be found throughout my whole head (at different lvls of roughness). I've finally been able to get a handle on the the massive increase in matting and fairy knots (and in turn hairloss) these strands caused. Im looking for tips on restoring my curl pattern and keeping moisture in, besides regularly deep conditioning and using clean CG products bc I do that. Thank you."
TraumaMamaZ,lpdosg,"You‚Äôre telling my story here! Same everything but I only left it in my hair 20-30min on 2 separate occasions. Everyone says ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt hurt your hair‚Äù and ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt contain protein; it‚Äôs a bond builder‚Äù. BULL CRAP. My hair has never broken off before using that overpriced hair killer and now I have so many broken off hairs I have the halo effect. I also have split ends, knots and a bunch of those wiry hairs like you show in the video; never had any of those before and I‚Äôm 40... Olaplex #3 killed almost 2ft of nice growth I planned to donate. Instead, I‚Äôll probably be getting a pixie cut."
rosenylundismyfav,lpdosg,"Olaplex 3 can‚Äôt ruin a curl pattern.

If you‚Äôre using it too much or when not necessary it can mess up your protein/moisture balance. You might need a protein free deep moisturizer to offset excess protein. Is your hair brittle and breaking?"
Istinline,lpdnth,"I loved that gel so much üò≠

wildwhirly,lpdnth,"Best gel for hair that gets curlier as it dries?&&&Hey y‚Äôall! I stopped using deva curl due to all of the controversy, but I still haven‚Äôt found a gel that works as well as the ultra defining gel. The ultra defining gel seemed to make my hair curlier  with more spirals. My hair curls up more as it dries and most of the gels I‚Äôve tried since make it straighter/wavier. I‚Äôve tried aussie, uncle funky‚Äôs daughter, and nym curl talk. I have 2c/3a, fine, normal porosity hair for reference. Does anyone have any dupes or recommendations?&&&Amazing, thank you!!&&&I love the blueberry bliss leave in, so I‚Äôll have to try this. thank you!!&&&I‚Äôve heard good things about Ecoslay, I‚Äôll have to try it.

harehere17,lpdh40,"You sound like you're all set! :) Only thing I can think of: I recently saw ""hammock diffusing"" on here and it seemed like a neat technique. I don't really have the patience to diffuse my hair ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
yagirlbmoney,lpdh40,"New to diffusing?&&&Hi! I finally got a diffuser attachment for my blow dryer and I'm looking for some advice to best work it into my routine.

I usually just wash and go, I'll use some product(s) in my hair to tame it but otherwise I don't do a lot in terms of styling.

I watched a few short tutorials and tried one that seemed simple enough. After I got out of the shower I combed through my hair, used some leave in conditioner and gel before using the blow dryer, flipping my head upside down and using the diffuser in sections.

I definitely got some more defined curls than usual! My hair is somewhere between 2b and 3a, I need a haircut so my hair is being weighed down right now and is more wavy.

Any tips or tutorials would be greatly appreciated!"

16hpfan,lpd0pe,Looks great! Your hair sounds like mine. Do you do protein treatments at all? I never know if I should or not.
tamltiger,lpd0pe,"Day 5 curls, a bit fluffy but holding up well!&&&&&&Thanks! Yes the Everescents Orange blossom remedy is a protein treatment. I like to use both moisture and protein. Since using some products with protein I've found my curls hold their shape for longer.&&&Routine this time for my fine, low density, low porosity hair: 
Pre poo with raw shea butter deep treatment masque for 20 mins

Shampoo with natural instinct moisture surge shampoo

Condition with everescents orange blossom remedy treatment.

Apply leave in garnier papaya hair food. Detangle with detangling brush.

Apply everescents universal ylang ylang styling cream.

Styled with top down method and denman brush.

Applied jessecurls gelebration, scrunched in. Microplopped excess product and water.

Diffused with dyson supersonic dryer.

When dry scrunched out the crunch and fluffed at the roots.

Each night I put my hair in a satin bonnet and sleep on a satin pillowcase. The bonnet makes a big difference.

On day 4 I added a little cantu curl revitalizer on the right side only as the curls were losing their shape a little.

On day 5 this morning I sprayed with water and lavender essential oil as per Lorraine Massey handbook as a scalp refresher. When the hair was dry I fluffed it at the roots to regain volume.

I've never waited this long to restyle my hair but so far so good!"

Revolutionary-Arm-80,lpcz7v,"Can Latinas wear braids?&&&I have had this question in my mind for what seems forever. I am Venezuelan, I am mixed, and I have 3b-c curls. I grew up with only the white side of my family so, as a kid I experienced the typical experience of my mom not knowing how to handle my hair. So, I'd constantly get it braided until I got old enough to take care of it myself and stopped getting my hair braided.

However, through the years of going to the beach, and wanting to protect my hair and wanting to let it grow in braids, and just have braids because they are absolutely beautiful. I have resisted styling it that way because I acknowledge the traditions and importance braids have in Black people. I know that cultural appropriation is a serious and real issue, especially when certain styles are rebranded and made ""trendy"". So, I never want to fall into that category, and want to remain respectful.

So, I want to ask you guys this question: **Is it okay for Latin/Hispanic people to get their curly hair braided?**"
Wandering_Lights,lpcz7v,It is fine to braid your hair. Plenty of cultures have been wearing braids for hundreds of years.
inv_dore,lpcz7v,Braid your hair. It‚Äôs a great protective style choice and Latinas/Hispanics of all cultures have been braiding their hair in all kinds of ways forever now. I think the issue is only if you pretend you invented braids. You‚Äôre fine girl.
nemicolopterus,lpcz7v,Thank you for being sensitive to how Black people who do not pass as white must deal with racism regarding their hair.  r/hipsterracism or r/askablackperson would be a better place to ask this question.
shattered_illusions,lpcz7v,"Yes, you can wear braids. It's a good protective style. It only becomes cultural appropriation when non-black celebrities braid their hair like black women, and then claim that they invented that specific style of braiding. (Like Kim K getting cornrows then claiming those are ""boxer braids"")."
WeAreStarless,lpcj1a,"yeah, ""milks"" are generally leave-in conditioners (""smoothies"" are often creams, ""jellies"" are gels and ""custards"" are something in between those two. i have no idea why so many products are named after food!)"

beataeriis,lpcei4,"Got a haircut 2 days ago but I sort of don't like it... (more detail in comments)&&&&&&Aaa so true! I usually just part in the middle but changing the part could really mix things up&&&Aww thank you ü•∫ You're so sweet&&&As the title says, I got a haircut 2 days ago and I don't really like it, not that there's anything wrong with it per say, but it just feels a bit bland? It sort of looks exactly how my hair was before except I took an inch off and my hair more or less looks all the same now.  I'm not sure if it's just me thinking so or what but I'm not quite satisfied üôÉ  Maybe it's due to my now grown out layers just looking blah there? It's just not my thing whatever is going on honestly.  Not sure what to try next time I get it cut or how to spruce up my hair in the meantime.

Let me know your thoughts.

My Routine:

Wash with Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo and Conditioner.  Use Shea Moisture Manuka Honey Masque when I need a deep conditioner.  Style on wet ish, sectioned hair with Caviar Flex Hold Styling Lotion.  Use denman to style.  Scrunch in John Frieda Mousse.  Hover diffuse and then scrunch diffuse until dry.&&&Aww thank you!! It took some time to get it like this but recently binge watching videos by manesbymell on youtube has really helped me with the process lol"
jennarenn,lpcei4,"On point curls never look blah. I upvoted for the gloss and definition. Very jealous, TBH."
rojipantycomplex,lpcei4,"An easy, quick fix could be to part your hair more to the side rather than down the middle. You'll at least have a layer on one side!"
say_keeshond,lpcei4,"You literally have my dream hair. I'd cry happy tears if my hair would look anything close to that sometime. Maybe your cut didn't gave you the change you wanted, but just cutting off split ends can be good too :)"

Glued-Up,lpbyji,"You could try breaking your really big curl clumps, it would create the look of more consistency???"
Stranger_Witty,lpbyji,"Super uneven curl pattern&&&&&&Hi, so I have a super random curl pattern and it‚Äôs always been like this. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs from damage because i never have dyed it and never really used heat. The most i ever did was dry brush it. Anyways, my hair is pretty much all the same length but shrinkage makes those tiny curls super obvious. My routine when the picture was taken was just shea moisture shampoo and conditioner, and then the curl smoothie and a denman brush mixed with finger rolling. The tighter curls I don‚Äôt really do anything too, and the rest of my hair is a loose curl/wave even with all that effort. Does anyone have any advice on how to fix this, or make it less obvious?"
anonymous_here767,lpbyji,"If it's safe to do so in your area, you might really benefit from a curly hair cut. To my knowledge, they take into account your different curl types when they trim. The layers would probably help everything to lay better."
