Fluffy-Imagination51,qk45ok,In my experience they usually use a more fine comb to trim BUT your hair should have been fully detangled with a wide tooth comb first.
Lefty1992,qk45ok,"Hair stylist kept pulling on my hair&&&I've never let my hair grow out until recently. I've always had it buzzed short. During Covid, I wasn't seeing clients at work, so I let it grow down to around chin length. I have wavy hair on top and curly hair on the sides. It's pretty thick, so I always use a wide tooth comb. My hair is dry, so I'm usually careful with it. Today I went to get my hair trimmed for the first time since last year. The stylist just wet it and pulled a fine tooth comb through it. I could hear the curly hair on the sides crackle as she did it. The comb caught in the curls, pulling my head to the side. She just told me to keep my head straight. Maybe she thought I wouldn't care because I'm a guy in my 20s, but she was pretty rough about it, like she didn't care whatsoever about damaging it. Do they need to use a fine tooth comb to trim and do they usually just force a comb through? I've never let my hair grow before, so idk if this is normal or not."
-HappyLady-,qk3rm1,Those look like legit curls to me.
danihodgs,qk3rm1,"What type of waves do I have?&&&https://photos.app.goo.gl/yBuvbBGbBALVB9wYA

This is my hair when it's wavy and with some gel in it and I had washed it with not your mother's curl talk shampoo and conditioner 💖 I love that stuff!! So what type of wavy hair does everyone think I have?"
RegionImpossible7701,qk3pta,"Hair damage&&&Hi! My hair has damage from several different factors (heat, dye, bleach, etc.). When my hair is healthy I have mostly 2b/2c waves with some spirals. Recently my hair has been very brittle and is thinning out quite a bit. It has been drying pretty poofy with hardly any defined waves or curls. Is there any way I can save my hair or would I be better off chopping it all off and starting over?"
inv_dore,qk3pta,Deep oil treatments. Black castor is a popular one.

jbakker12,qk37se,"Happy Halloween 🎃 Vote for Pedro ☑️&&&&&&My routine: This is Day 4 hair. Wanted to get the frizzier look to stay true to character. Co wash with Tresemme Coconut Nourish, rinse, then de tangle with wide toothed comb and same product. Rinse one more time. Use Herbal Essences Set Me Up Gel and let air dry. Then SOTC and voila. I'll usually wet my hair on non wash days to re activate the gel too."
coloradopeace,qk2a0a,"Bangs big hair&&&Hey
My bangs are all messed up.. just got a cut

Any idea if straightening them is ok?

Plus my hair is growing out instead of up! I need help

Or I am going back to straightening which I def am trying to not do at this point"
marcieedwards,qk1nvt,"The art of finger coiling!&&&&&&Routine: Love, Beauty and Planet curls line for shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner + my dad’s old gel"
CowboyCombat,qk123a,How do you get those thick volumes of curl. I just scrunched my cast and while I'm happy with the lol for today they're never like that. They just don't get much bigger than the wet cast.
DelicateIslandFlower,qk123a,Your hair is amazing!!
DiaPanquecito,qk123a,"I still don't get how scrunchin the cast, leaves you with a totally different hair!"
LosNava,qk123a,"Your daily reminder not to judge your hair day by the ugly cast.&&&&&&Thank you! It’s taken so long for me to appreciate them.&&&Routine:

Shae Moisture Deep Condish in the shower
Cold rinse
AsIAm CoWash
Cold rinse
Miss Jessie’s Honey Curls
Aunt Jackie’s Frizz Patrol Mousse
Denman to distribute and define curls
Praying hands Aussie Freeze Gel
Air dry/diffuse 
Scrunch out the crunch with oil&&&I do have very dense hair, very coarse, so lots of natural volume. Using the Denman brush helped my curls become more defined. When my hair is mostly dry and still in a cast  I put it in a pineapple sometimes and it helps with the volume when I scrunch it out so the product doesn’t weigh it down.&&&Thank you ☺️&&&Wow, so appreciated ☺️&&&Thanks!!&&&🙏🏽🙏🏽 thank you!!&&&♥️🙏🏽&&&I know right? 😂 My husband thinks it’s witchcraft. It really does transform my hair and I don’t understand how the texture looks so different just minutes later."
Pancakebarbie007,qk123a,HOW???
Slight_Statistician6,qk123a,😍😍😍👌
ThunderTaker1992,qk123a,Amazing definition and volume ❤️❤️❤️
flirtycraftyvegan,qk123a,Absolutely stunning!!
knit_stitch_ride,qk123a,"I always have to remind myself not to try and ""fix"" my hair when it's wet or has the cast, I've ruined so many good hair days that way. Your curls are stunning btw, so full, I'm definitely jealous."
niamonapope,qk123a,Wow!😍😍beautiful!!
queentee26,qk123a,WOW!😍😍 what a transformation
taylorjustinejackson,qk123a,WINNING 👏🏻😍
YoYo_ismael,qk0owb,Hair type?
echo1981,qk0owb,I bought their leave in conditioner and its amazing! How do you like the shampoo? I have heard mixed reviews.
kelthuzad12,qk0owb,"First time ever finding a product (Ecoslay) that holds my hair over night&&&I ended up cutting off my hair after having my daughter last year because of major hair loss. It's finally growing back but this stage is the worst for trying to find some kind of day to day that doesn't have my hair looking awful.

Heard about Ecoslay recently and bought their bundle of the schnapps shampoo, butter cream deep conditioner, and jello shot gel.

Y'all the hold on this gel is fantastic! I mean I've never been able to get through 2 days (1 night) without my hair basically turning into a Q-tip

I don't know how well this will be in the long term, but right now I'm so happy.

Routine: Don't really have one, but for this wash (and photos) I only used the 3 Ecoslay products listed. I sat under the dryer with the deep conditioner and left it on under the gel.[Day 1](https://iili.io/57SYRs.jpg)[Day 2](https://iili.io/57SaOG.jpg)

http://imgur.com/a/H5x9RYT - album for daily pictures on how well it holds up over the next few days&&&Tysm :)&&&I REALLY liked the shampoo. At first I was worried that my hair would feel stripped and dry, but it felt very soft, clean, and moisturized after washing. Out of all the stuff I've tried, I've only ever gotten that kind of result with [Creme of Nature Professional Detangling and Conditioning Shampoo](https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/curly-hair-care/professional-detangling-and-conditioning-shampoo/SBS-105126.html) (my usual shampoo).&&&I have no idea lol. 4 something"
moo124cow,qk0owb,Your hair looks great!
Head_Reference_9704,qk0o2c,I straightened my hair 2 weeks ago to get a good trim. It did wonders! My curls look so pretty now
NARE19,qk0o2c,"Not as long as you don’t do it super often, I try to use CurlSmiths Bond Rehab Salve after I straighten my hair, I think it helps a bit"
gordita_who,qk0o2c,"I straightened my hair&&&I’ve been trying some aspects of the curly girl method and I’ve been having some great success. 
But I basically got mad at myself and straightened my hair to spite myself (I know it’s stupid lol). 
Did I just set myself way back?&&&Not much!!&&&That was my plan!! Thank you so much. I’m going to clarify and then do the mask"
ur_notmytype,qk0o2c,do you have damage?
HearMeCMe,qjzy7w,"First find your hair type I think you're like a 2a wavy type. Research how to find out the porosity of your hair. From there, look for products suited to your type . I'm guessing you should avoid heavier ingredients lime Shea butter. I think for your hair it's just learning what styling product and drying method to use. There's a great Yt curly hair community where they test curly hair products and also educate on how often to use  protein, sulfate free versus with sulfates, porosity, scalp care,detoxing, styling techniques. I discovered the curly hair community in 2019 and now I don't feel so alone with my hair journey lol. Trust me once you really understand your hair, you'll start to really pay attention to how it acts to both product, technique, weather, etc like a science experiment. Good luck!"
Mood_Oof,qjzy7w,"The ends of my hair would often look like that when I brushed my hair while it was wet. I think it probably had to do with the pulling/tugging, plus then all my hair was brushed straight and didn't want to move from the position. I switched to finger combing and the ends look much healthier, mainly because the curl is never combed out. Maybe try combing it with less emphasis on getting all the hair combed through and more on getting tangles out. Hopefully that helps"
West-Relationship108,qjzy7w,Moisture! I would go for moisture. Wetplop was a game changer for me. Use products that are curly girl approved - and just give it time
blondeone12,qjzy7w,"Help with hair. What should I be doing for my hair. It always seems so frizzy and broken. New to this so products/routine wanted. Not sure what my hair would be classified as.&&&&&&Currently using ethique shampoo bar 2 times a week, and their conditioner bar every day or every other day. Not loving the conditioner bar as it doesn’t seem to help. I comb out in the shower and air dry."
fluffypinkblonde,qjzy7w,The simplest thing for me to grasp when I started was sulphate free. Once you click onto the ranges of products that are silicone and sulphate free you should have a much easier time.
CowboyCombat,qjzphj,Just picked up Aussie Instant Freeze Gel from recommendations and just wondering how is it used? With my Cantu Coconut Curl Cream or is it in place of?&&&&&&Routine: Styling when drenched scrunch and airdry.
Slight_Statistician6,qjzphj,Apply cream first then gel. I use Cantu twist and lock gel and it needs a bit more hold so I layer the aussie over it.
