becomingmoremyself,jqpnkk,Mexico City natural hair product shop recommendations!&&&I am newly based in Mexico City and need to re-stock on shampoo and conditioner :) Any store recommendations?
WeAreStarless,jqpng1,"i wouldn't personally recommend a 2-in-1 product like this. shampoo is meant for your roots, whereas conditioner is meant for your mids and ends, and so you kind of need separate products to achieve that"
whinypup,jqpng1,"I'm New and Have Questions about A Possible Routine&&&Hello! I am a beginner to the CGM with wavy hair and I have a couple questions! First of all, for my future with the CGM I got the Jason 2 in 1 Dandruff Relief because it is Paraben-free, Sulfate-free and has Jojoba and Olive Oil in it. I always used shampoos without any sulfates but I have extremely oily natural roots and I have to wash my hair often. Am I supposed to use a separate conditioner when using this 2 in 1 or is this the only product I have to use when washing my hair? Because I know there's a huge push on conditioners for moisture in CGM but my hair is already very oily, and this shampoo already has conditioner in it. I was thinking maybe for my routine I will wash my hair with just the 2 in 1 every \~4 days, apply a gel as I come out of the shower, and do deep conditioning once every two washes. Is this enough? :/"
NewtotheYGK,jqp3oc,"Love your cut, I’m also thinking of going for bangs... do they drive you crazy though/in your eyes?"
milkbrains,jqp3oc,"not the bayang&&&&&&routine: wash w organigrow’s clarifying shampoo and moisurizing conditioner. 
for days where i need EXTRA (though i make sure my washes are always hydrating) moisture, i use shea moisture’s strengthen and restore treatment masque and detangle w it in.
for a good balance, i make sure my styling products have protein in them. rn i’m obsessed w shea moisture’s coconut and hibiscus curl enhancing smoothie and mousse!!
i’ll rake the cream throughout my hair first and style w a denman brush. i’m hella lazy w my hair so i haven’t been parting it to define w the brush lately. i’ll just brush it all downward and define/coil certain pieces that need help. and since im lazy i usually air dry but then will diffuse for a bit toward the end <3 bc im not only lazy but also impatient <3&&&thank u <3&&&only if they’re too long! the story w my bangs is that i had them pre-transition w my relaxed hair so they were always worn straight. so before they were getting “long”. now that i’m focusing on my curls, they look way shorter than they are. stretched out, they’re up to my jawbone. coiled and diffused, they shrink up to above my eyes!! so even if they’re long you can kind of help them in that department so they dont poke ur eyes <3&&&<3"
natalia-alianova,jqp3oc,I love your cut and definitely think the bangs work well for you!
wO0h0onow,jqp3oc,"Woah, I like it!"
WeAreStarless,jqoy94,"check out the stickied post on top of the sub called [""start here! beginner info""](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/joigdl/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/) and that will tell you all about the curly girl method!"
hch458,jqoy94,"There’s nothing wrong with shampoo, CG just means use shampoos that are sulfate/ silicone free!"
sammysamsam999,jqoy94,"hi, I’m new here...&&&Hi, so I have hated my curly hair almost my whole life. I say almost because there was a period of time not to long ago where I enjoyed curly hair. I was using devacurl (just the mouse and volumizer) at the time and my hair was amazing. But it obviously ruined my hair! I’m now on a mission to bring back my nice curls after having them destroyed. I’ve read through parts of CGM and I know I’ll have to break some of those rules because I need to shampoo. I don’t really know where to start! I use bumble and bumble as a shampoo and really like their curl products too. I know it has sulphates in it but I haven’t had too much buildup so far. 

I find my scalp gets really itchy often, even right after washing my hair. This has been happening since I stopped using devacurl so it’s not my current b&b shampoo because I only switched to that recently. 

As someone with hair that has been bleached (about 4 months ago) where should I start?! There’s so much info, I find it overwhelming!! I recently got a chop to get rid of some of the bleached hair but not all of it. 

Thanks!"
BatXos,jqotmv,"My hair kinda looks like this if I brush it too much, didn’t scrunch enough, and it prob doesn’t have enough gel/mousse on it when it was wet. So, maybe try running your fingers through it and scrunch it with your hands more? Then while it’s still wet if you wanna keep the wet look apply some type of hair product to keep the look locked in (while doing the scrunching and running ur fingers through your hair) :D That makes it more defined for me usually! Hopefully this helps and good luck!"
Kelise022,jqotmv,Looks like you need to use a hydrating mask and depending on how soft it it’s maybe a protein mask as well. Your curls look like this because of the years of straightening or heat styling. Give it time and stick with a minimally invasive hydrating routine.
Kitty_Rose,jqotmv,"First day of curly hair in over 15 years&&&&&&I washed it with Matrix Keep Me Vivid pearl infusion shampoo and conditioner. While the conditioner was in my hair, I combed it out with a wide tooth comb. After rinsing it out, I scrunched in Curlsmith Curl Defining Styling Soufflé. Then I gently scrunched out some of the excess water with a microfiber towel and let it air dry. 

I don't know exactly what kind of curls I have. Is there any way to find out how porous they are? Any suggestions on other techniques I can try? And what do you all think of it?

Edit: I have fine hair, there's just a bunch of it. Does that make a difference?&&&Thanks. I'll try that next wash day.&&&Thanks for the advice. I picked up a hydrating mask today."
SomethingComesHere,jqotmv,"Looks just super dry and damaged. Keep doing what you’re doing, consider switching to a silk pillow case. The rest is a waiting game. You should see results in a few weeks if not sooner, take progress pics!!"
kattatronic,jqotmv,"Hi OP! My hair looks like this when I need to do a clarifying wash + deep condition. Also, if you live somewhere with hard water, I recommend looking into a hard water shampoo. 

I almost gave up on CGM because I couldn't get my hair to not be frizzy and my curls were never defined anymore... finding out about/using a hard water shampoo finally got me back on track with CGM!! My hair is back to it's old self again and the frizz is almost all gone! But definitely follow up a with a deep conditioner because hard water shampoos are very stripping (if you end up going that route)."
losconsejos,jqotmv,exciting!
LuluRose27,jqol5b,Curls!
_radass,jqol5b,Probably! Looks like you have a lot of damage from bleaching/colors. I did too. I had to stop to get my curls to come in!
blckrainbow,jqol5b,Olaplex 3 for minimizing damage.
oneofthemgottabeugly,jqol5b,"ADVICE PLEASE! waves or no!?&&&&&&I think I need a good haircut! and the top layer of my hair seems to always be super damaged and dry? I'm hoping if I continue with hair masks some curls may come through?! these photos are after the first proper masking session. 

how long are you in to your curly journey!? any advice please :) and thankyou&&&hello! thankyou for reading! I am currently using;

- garnier ultimate bends hair food banana shampoo

- garnier ultimate bends hair food banana conditioner

- garnier ultimate bends hair food banana hair mask

- wella shockwaves curls & waves mousse



I have recently purchased these products in hopes of discovering if i do indeed have wavy hair! 

the pictures are my hair air-dry after washing with shampoo& conditioner, with some mask in the ends and a slap of mousse, first time plopping! then left out to dry!
any tips and tricks that will help the rest of my hair get to the level of that one single curl (in my picture post) I would be over the moon!!&&&I deffo need a haircut! I'm in lockdown again so that will have to wait for now! I'll look into olapex :) thankyou for the advice"
schrodinger-s-cat,jqol5b,a fresh haircut and a treatment like olapex may bring waves or even curls back on stage
Saratrooper,jqoklh,"Day 1 try of HiBAR (Maintain shampoo + Volumize conditioner) for fine, low porosity 2B/2C hair&&&&&&ROUTINE

Shampoo: HiBAR Maintain 

Conditioner: HiBAR Volumize

Gel: LA Looks Mega Shaper (the yellow-colored one)


Rubbed shampoo into hair & rinsed, applied conditioner upside-ish as best as I could and scrunched water through to rinse it out. Gently shake head upside down and scrunch to encourage curls. Scrunched LA Looks Mega Shaper hair gel into wet hair, plopped into cotton towel for 1 hour (accidental overkill, typically try to only plop for ~30 minutes). Diffused on low or medium temp, medium speed. Wait 30-45 minutes to SOTC.

Okay, so I've been wading through the smattering of posts about trying solid shampoos to reduce plastic waste, and decided to give it a go myself. Most posts were about using HiBAR's Moisturize, which I anticipated would be way too heavy for my fine hair that goes flat if I even look at it funny.

I debated buying both bars in Volumize, but after a little digging through reviews on HiBAR's website and Facebook, found that some people were mixing the Maintain and Volumize to get the results they liked. My hair still gets greasy after only 2 days despite trying everything, so I figured Maintain would help clean up any product build-up and grime between washes/refreshing. I might go buy the Volumize shampoo bar if the Maintain is too much on that frequent of a basis.

So far my hair feels amazing and soft! I think I need to gently scrunch my towel through my hair to get rid of some extra water before putting the gel on because my curls did fall a tiny bit flatter in some spots, but nothing catastrophic. Previous routine was/is Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt shampoo and conditioner, which was just an *OKAY* replacement for their discontinued Fruit Fusion. :((&&&You're welcome! I had been waiting for my Shea Moisture to dwindle down, recently found HiBAR sold at a nearby grocery store, and decided to finally try it out!

I'll see how my refresh routine manages itself tomorrow with the new products in rotation.&&&Yeah! So, I actually did end up buying the Volumize shampoo and that works a lot better for volume, definition and how clean my hair feels (even after a day or so). I do keep the Maintain shampoo around for if my hair feels really gross and has too much build up, but it seems to simultaneously sometimes makes my hair feel like it gets gross faster between washes? (Kinda double-edged sword).

I don't know if I got a ""bad"" Volumize shampoo bar, but the shampoo has been used up twice as fast as the conditioner bar and I can't figure out *why*. 

I still need to clarify every month with my regular VO5 clarifying shampoo (or 3 weeks, whatever my hair feels like) to get a super clean ""reset""."
blinksprinkle,jqoklh,"looks great! thanks for posting. I've been looking into solid shampoo also and your hair looks/sounds similar to mine. might give it a go!

& happy cake day 🥳"
richsilk,jqoklh,I'm considering switching over to HiBAR and your hair situation sounds really similar to mine! Would you mind sharing an update now that some time has passed?

beachbaumn36,jqohyq,"Looking for advice. Current haircare routine: ogx biotin + collagen shampoo and tresemme volumizing conditioner. Coconut and castor oil mask once a week. Any suggestion on how access more waves/curls? Without any heat this is air dried&&&&&&Thanks for your reply, I would appreciate it if you can recommend any conditioner. In terms of the coconut oil application.

So I was debating if I should comment of your comment of the coconut oil. I understand that it seems like a not great option, but it's one thing that keeps my hair the most moist in the winter (I have tried other oils), it's also a hair ritual that was passed onto to me culturally/in family so I'm going to keep that part of the routine. I guess I'm more looking for conditioner and shampoo/any other product recommendations
Thanks again"
synthesizesanity,jqohyq,"Hi, not to be harsh but I’m a few words- coconut oil sucks there are much better oils please use a jojoba oil or rose hip oil or Argan oil ; literally anything but coconut oil. Also with curly hair you’re gonna want to invest in a better conditioner- curls need lots of moisture and quality ingredients to keep them looking good and while tressemes price tag is appealing you get what you pay for. Find a nicer conditioner and some better oils and check out different scrunching/plopping/finger curling/diffusing methods to see what works best"
Future_Bravolebrity,jqofg7,"Work out hair&&&I know there’s been threads about how everyone styles their hair while working out and a lot of the talk was re: not caring what it looks like and refreshing after as needed. What about when you need the hair to look good during the work out and when you hit brunch right after (a socially distant, outdoor brunch)? 😜"
Liv_NB,jqofg7,"Does your gym have driers? I wear mine in a pineapple and if damp at root (lovelyyy) blow dry it if I need to refresh it quick - although I guess they wouldn't have diffuser nozzles

Then I just fluff it and somehow it looks okay most of the time!"
WW76kh,jqofg7,"I'm assuming it's a work-out date and brunch after? 

High loose bun...leave the dents in your hair, so the curly roots are still there. Once you're done working out pull some of the curls out for a Grecia Goddess look. 

Loose bun...meaning just gather your hair, and no tugging. Use a smaller scrunchie."
Yiddis,jqofg7,I would French braid my hair the night before and then take out the braids after the workout and just fluff and fresh as much as possible. Rip curls but still nice hair
fahmleeisabigdill,jqofg7,"If I have somewhere to be after a workout that requires me to look nice, I try to make that my light day and do a cute half up half down that’ll work for both. I have long curly hair so typically, I’ll pull half up into a bun and just suffer with a hot neck for 40/45 minutes. I also make sure I bring this dry hair styling product I bought, I’m not home or I’d tell you the name but it’s pink and from not your mothers. I LOVE IT! I put a little, and I mean a little, in my palms rub them together then run loosely over my hair that’s down. I’ll restyle the bun if needed but make sure I’m not letting any of that hair down as it’ll be all wonky. I know some people hate the half up half down looks, but I think their cute and can be really comfortable and easy too."

youngnproud123,jqo88w,Can anyone please tell me what my hair type is&&&
amourplastique437,jqo7or,"I plop my bangs with my normal hair for around 15 minutes. I just put on leave in conditioner straight out the shower, then I plop, then add styling product.  Not putting product in until after plopping helps my bangs have a bit more volume. Hope this helped! :)"
bronzelily_,jqo7or,I have two cowlicks (!!) so I leave my fringe out otherwise it will never recover and go in the right direction. It does mean that it's harder to keep my hair wrapped up though.
bunnybabymimi,jqo7or,How do you plop if you have bangs?&&&Honestly what the question says^ do I include them in the plop?? Or leave them out and risk them being flat from the edge of the microfibre towel ??&&&Thank you! I appreciate your answer! :)&&&Absolutely!! I will try that next time! My bangs could always use more volume&&&The front of my hair gets a bit frizzy so I’ve always just not interfered with my bangs in fear of ruining them
tryin2wave2u,jqo7or,I have bangs and just plop with them. They end up fine. I usually plop for about 10 to 15 minutes.
LovelyLieutenant,jqo6dn,"Just talked about this product in another thread but I cannot recommend Kinky Curly Knot Today highly enough.  Fantastic detangler with excellent slip and because it has so few ingredients so many different hair types could struggle with, there's no harm in trying it.

I also have very long hair and can successfully detangle in the shower with only my fingers and this product.  I haven't used a comb or brush in months and I think that's really helped reduce some damage to my fine texture.

I will say my ends that have been around for years are naturally more rough and harder to detangle and have noticed lately that it's been 8 months since a trim so hopefully getting that done as well may eventually help."
brideebeee,jqo6dn,"Trimming off the dead ends that snaggle is so worth doing for the time and frustration it saves. 

When I'm overdue for a haircut there's a  pair of scissors right outside the shower to snip out knots that won't untangle with moderate effort. I go all judge judy executioner, *take that, troublemaker hairs! Let that be a lesson to the rest of you*."
flesheatingwitch,jqo6dn,"Anyone recommend a good detangler, my hair is close to my butt and I'm considering cutting it because brushing it is a nightmare.&&&&&&I haven't cut it in a year. Ill get it trimmed. Thanks"
Ambuhwavess,jqo0u1,"I have a similar problem as you with tangles. I have super thick 2c hair, and I’ve found that if I brush my hair out right before washing it it helps a TON. I usually wash my hair every 2-3 days, use a wide tooth brush and start from the ends of my hair and work in sections to brush it. Then in the shower after my hair has set with lots of conditioner for a few minutes I flip my hair over and comb it under the running water. I use a Wet Brush detangle comb. 

I think with wavy hair it is okay to brush when dry as long as you condition after. (That’s why I brush right before a wash. 

Also, I have long hair too and I put it in a loose braid at night. I’m thinking of getting a silk cap to wear to help with frizz and tangles."
brideebeee,jqo0u1,"A satin material pillowcase is worth it, doesn't need to be real silk. Dry brushing will never not make it puffier and the damage it causes makes for more tangles. You should absolutely be brushing it wet after working tons of conditioner into it; use a cheap one for this step.

 Comb downward starting from a few inches above the ends, move up some and repeat until you hit a knot or roots. Start using your fingers to comb, then go to a VERY wide tooth comb (the ones that hang on shower basket), then a less wide tooth, etc. As long as you can comb thru everything without snags fine comb or brush is unnecessary."
smiley_katerina,jqo0u1,"Wavy 2a 2b curls HELP&&&Girls I really hope someone have a similar hair to me so I can get an advise, because I’m on the end of my patience! My hair ... a Love-hate relationship - really oily fine and tangled hair with 2a 2b curls and a lot of freeze ! So I have the problem that I try to use the curly girl method and don’t brush my wavy hair until I wash it , but my hair is so fine and gets so tangled that it looks so bad !! And if I don’t brush it after few days is so much worse and I make more breakage when I brush . And if I brush it it gets so puffy and frizzy . Now I try to brush it every other day and when it gets puffy to put some hair oil , which actually helps but it weighs it down and looks after one day really greasy.
I bought a Tangle Teaser Brush for fine hair and it is so much better , but still it is a disaster ! My brushing time is around one hour - one and a half (my hair is relative long , until the down side of boobs :D ) I tried to spray it with water and conditioner mixture, but I don’t find any difference until I make it almost completely wet (and I have read that it is really bad to brush wavy hair wet ) . I have trimmed it before 3 months and I will trim it again a little next week (really hope this helps ) every time i take shower I make a hair mask after and I have the feeling that I put really a lot of effort! Also I loose a lot of hair , I get so scared when I look at the brush! 
My shampoo is without silicones and sulfates , but I think my hair masks have silicones and Alkohol, I can try to find another without (do you think this is a problem ) 
Also I bought castor oil and before shower I mix it with almond oil and 2-3 drops of rosemary oil, put it on my hair with the help of wide comb on my hair and leave it for hour or two . When I wash it I use a old T-shirt to dry it and mostly leave it so and sweep with it . The T-shirt is a litte small so i plan to purchase a special micro fiber turban for this purpose. Also I found some cool silk hair scrunchies I will buy . A silk pillowcase is also amazing, but it is quite pricey, do you think it is worth?
So it was a long monologue, I’m just so frustrated, because I really feel that I make so much and I’m not to happy with the results. 
If there are any advices from the wavy girls out there please share :) Also if there are some girls from Europe or more specifically Germany and have products for wavy hair to recommend, I will be soooo happy !!!&&&Do you mean to brush it and than condition it when dry ? I have only a normal conditioner that I use in the shower after the shampoo, but you probably mean something else right ? I feel your pain with the tangled is soo bad ! Do you also need so ling Time to brush them out ? I also start from the ends and brush my way up in sections (otherwise it is just not possible ) I also started using cream definder , bun I’m still not sure what to think . It looks so goon but if I try to brush it out is quite hard and my tangled hair gets even more pulled out . This with the silk cap is interesting, I have googled them . This can be a interesting idea and it I a little more affordable than the silk pillowcase"
Hilarious_83,jqnuad,"I shower at night and I either shower early enough my hair has time to air dry to 80% or I diffuse. I leave the gel crunchy, put it into a pineapple and sleep on a satin pillow case. In the morning I scrunch out any crunch that's left"
