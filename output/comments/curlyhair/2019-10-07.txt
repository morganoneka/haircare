9BadWolf9,dhkuea,YES SO MUCH YES.
GooseWasLoosed,dhkuea,"This is so wholesome, it made my Monday!"
Jamienope,dhkuea,I have been cutting my own hair for 6 years now -- don't feel bad! Stylists were always such jerks about my hair texture that I got tired of paying them $100+ to insult me.
iforgettheirnamesnow,dhkuea,Are you ready to hear about...topknots????
mellyjo77,dhkuea,"> Schrodinger‚Äôs plop     

Lol!"
shmoopie313,dhkuea,"Can we take a moment to appreciate those perfect, super-comfy plops?&&&My hair is plopped and I really don't want to take it down. It's out of the way and not a bother. Kept it up while cooking dinner so it didn't smell like chicken-fried steak before the week even starts. It's a bit of a Schrodinger's plop too, like all of them are. It could be the precursor to my best hair day ever, or it could be a monster waiting to kill me in my sleep. Who knows? My husband is (lovingly) picking on me about it. I look ridiculous. It's been up for about 4 hours. Who cares right now? Not me, that's for sure. It's really comfy, and knowing once I let it out that I have a week of curl appeasement ahead of me just makes me not want to.

I even hacked 4 inches off before plopping and do not care one bit that I don't really know the results yet. (Don't judge. I'm poor and I used my best scissors. It's what I've done my whole life whenever it just becomes too much.)

Why can't I just be plopped forever? \*sigh\*&&&It opted for monster trying to kill me in my sleep, so no pictures. Cutting it wet interrupted my whole post-wash process and it frizzed out, but even with that it is so much healthier so still glad I chopped it. Maybe next week when it‚Äôs better behaved and more appeased with product.&&&Topknots are great, but my hair is really heavy and they always either slide out or give me a headache. Sometimes I can pull off a comfortable all-day messy bun but those are as rare as the perfect plop."
ttho10,dhkuea,"Welll.... let's see it, then? What was the result?"
tambourine7,dhksvl,lol saw u/eep27 post something like this. My hair is extra spooky&&&&&&Routine: wash with Shea moisture curl and Shea moisture shine hibiscus shampoo and raw Shea butter moisture retention shampoo. Finger comb and scrunch in Cantu Shea butter leave in conditioner cream and then Cantu twist and lock gel.
1DigYou,dhkq8i,is gel necessary?&&&especially for shorter hair
9BadWolf9,dhkq8i,Depends on your hair. I use mousse for example. If I don't I get a frizz ball with 0 definition. Actually if I don't my hair is just puffy and limp.
Alexsssandria,dhkq8i,"In my opinion, yes - definitely! It helps immensely with frizz and my curls lasting passed day 1 for me."
Alpas012,dhkq8i,"I've been using coconut oil/leave-in conditioner instead, (though I've been recommended not to use oil cause it can damage your hair)"
GooseWasLoosed,dhkq8i,It's not necessary but it can provide better definition and shine than other products. I'm on a mousse kick at the moment (Herbal Essences Totally Twisted) and it works well for my fine hair. LA Looks gel also makes my hair look amazing though.
HikariTenshii,dhkq8i,I don't like using gel on my hair so most of the times I just use a creamy leave-in. I does the work.
curvyandcurly,dhkq8i,"In my opinion yes. I can get good wash-day results without gel, but if I want those results to last nearly all week then I need a very generous amount of gel.

Edit: not to mention diffusing without gel for me turns my head into a giant frizz ball with zero definition."
iforgettheirnamesnow,dhkq8i,"Depends on your hair. I don't use gel. Sometimes I'll use leave-in/cream, but mostly just shampoo/condish/a drop of oil is my routine."
luna8913,dhkq8i,Yeah I find it to be
HalpMehzPlez230,dhkct0,"Somewhat inexpensive but good silk pillowcases and diffusers?&&&Hey there~ 
I‚Äôm new to the CGM and was wondering what are some good pillowcase and diffuser products(that aren‚Äôt too expensive).

I‚Äôm making a list of products to buy to start my journey on getting healthier curls.
Adding links to where I can find the products would be extremely helpful too!"
mellenobrien,dhkct0,Check Amazon. I got a couple of different silk pillowcases there.
phoebelunalove,dhkct0,"You can check us out for a really good silk pillowcase [lovephoebeluna.com](https://lovephoebeluna.com). They are 22 silk momme weight, 6a grade mulberry silk, with an envelope closure. Will last with proper care. 

Whatever brand you end up choosing, try to get a silk pillowcase that is a 19momme or higher. The lower momme weights are fine but they may rip after a year or less especially if they have a hidden zipper."
9BadWolf9,dhkcng,"Seriously, I feel this. The hair near my neck are resilient 3a (or 3b not sure) while the top is wavy at best (2b on a good day). I honestly want to cut it off."
Dftba1996,dhkcng,I have this same problem!! Literally if anyone has tips i need them too
N8JOI,dhkcng,I have the exact same problem. I use the Not Your Mothers curl line and the Kinky Kurly Custard. I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything that will help. I‚Äôll be trolling your post to see what responses you get. Thanks for asking the question.
aaelizaa,dhkcng,"I have the same issue. Well, my top layer forms beautiful curls when damp and scrunched, but it refuses to hold them like my under layers do. The best product I‚Äôve found to help is NYM Beach Babe Texturizer. It‚Äôs probably because it starts to stiffen within minutes of applying. I‚Äôm still experimenting though to try and find something that works for more low maintenance days."
caroper2487,dhkcng,Straight Layers&&&The top layers of my hair are really straight while the underneath layers are super wavy. I usually pull it half up with a clip bc underneath looks so much better. Does anyone else have this problem? I hate it! Can I do anything about it? I use Cantu and then a diffuser bc I hate the feeling of wet hair. I can never get the top layers as wavy as everything else! Any advice?
perplexedbarrel,dhkcng,"I have had people come in and just get the top layer permed to match the rest of their curl pattern, some people just don't have a consistent pattern all over no matter what they do. I've seen people with only curl in the nape and people with kinky temples and ringlets all over, I have a boy with curls only on the corners of his front hairline while the rest if it's gone straight. But it's an option if you want it to match the curp patter and it's that far off or It could be too heave and need a little more layering."
-Theliquor,dhkch9,If you stand it up on one side and then tie the cord to a bottle of moisturizer you could turn it into a little drying rack for your plop towels
snarkychain,dhkch9,I used to straighten my hair all the time in middle school...it was the mid 2000s. My curly headed mother was horrified.
tinysubtleties18,dhkch9,It‚Äôs been a while since I used my straightener...&&&

Pachuko_pinyata,dhjkhw,What do you say in the hairdressers for the round shape? I don‚Äôt have any curly hairdressers near me so I am a permanent triangle. I messed it up myself too.
Red7336,dhjkhw,"You can your hair down and ""up"" without having to restyle!"
RedditSkippy,dhjkhw,"Amazing hair, OP!"
Sawa27,dhjkhw,"Before discovering CGS my worst hair day was wash day. Since using curly girl methods now wash day is always my best hair day.  Maybe I‚Äôm using the wrong products though. I have low porosity but my hair hates when I use light oils in it. So I use Shea moisture Shea butter and my hair loves it. However, I find my hair gets oily on the sides of my head, about 2 or 3 days after a wash, where as before curly girl, I‚Äôve never experienced oily hair."

its_afro_menina_,dhjkhw,"Hair is at its best a few days AFTER you wash (for me, that is). Mine's usually a heavy curly wet thing before it transforms into full on afro. Eu amo meu cabelo. 10/10 would not trade.&&&&&&Aww, obrigada! You are too kind <3 Sometimes my hair won't let me see, though LOL&&&My usual routine involves some kind of protein treatment, usually with honey. I moisturize with Cantu coconut cream or shea moisture. I've also use a local concoction (from the Caribbean) sold in-stores here called ""Curly Girls"" - it's amazing. I use lots of rose water and maybe glycerine, too throughout the day, depends on how much time I have. My hair loves water. Protective styling is a must so buns are my go-to style in a hurry. Otherwise, haven't braided or anything within the last couple years. Twists yes, before bed.&&&LOL, wow. I did NOT notice that. Honestly, my profile's a few days old and I owe it (joining reddit) all to some rando who posted my photos all over a couple subs. Someone sent me screenshots and when I got on, couldn't find them at all to report. I don't even know if it's related to that but what can ya do?&&&Obrigada! x&&&Thank you, belo!

Thanks, y'all!

Voces sao otimos xx&&&Thank you xo&&&Thank you <3&&&Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è&&&Never! Thank youuu ‚ù§Ô∏è&&&Noooo I stay FAR away from hairdressers to be entirely honest. I guarantee you they will mess my hair up. What I usually do is carefully and thoroughly comb my hair out, then, using my middle and index fingers, I gather small sections at a time and trim the VERY ends. This is why combing it out is necessary; you're able to see the overall shape you're creating much, MUCH better and without taking as much off as a scissor-happy hairdresser might.&&&Thank you so much! I'll post details about that soon for anyone wanting xo :)&&&Hmm, that's odd. My hair and scalp usually absorbs everything by the third day, so much so, that I have to reapply some product. I'm not sure how one would combat that, maybe try some water BEFORE the oils etc.? You're probably right about the products you're currently using. Switch it up a bit, see what happens.&&&Thanks :)&&&Thanks, my boyfriend's design! Pretty comfy, too!&&&Obrigado xo&&&Obrigada pelo amor! Thank you!&&&Thanks!&&&Thank youu!&&&Obrigado!&&&Yup! üíÉüèΩ&&&Thanks!&&&Thank you so much! 

Lol, eu sou apenas meio brasileira! My Mom's East Indian (Caribbean).&&&Gracas ao meu pai! 

But same, maybe one more... maybe French. You definitely should, though :)&&&Umm... favorites would have to be Rusko, KTN and Mt. Eden. Caspa and Flux are pretty good, too.&&&Deep wubs are everything.&&&Thank you! :)

And yes, but not nearly as often as I used to.&&&Why thank you, bonita.&&&Thank you! <3&&&O que?&&&Oh, not a problem.

I do regular two-strand (I think it's called) twists before bed but I braid it at the base so it stays better. My hair untwists pretty easily with the regular two-strand. When i wake and depending on what my plans are, I undo them, finger-comb, spritz a little bit of rose water and throw it in a bun/style.

As I mentioned before, if you want to avoid your hair drying out, use a light oil after the rose water. That might actually help with your frizz issue, too.&&&Lol! Thanks, sugar.&&&Haha, thank you... why wouldn't you?&&&Thanks for the love!&&&thank you!&&&Thank you :)

And indeed <3&&&Oi, muito obrigado! x&&&Thanks!

dacasaurus,dhjj79,"Got my routine pretty good- next steps?&&& https://imgur.com/a/3uYCFJ1 

Currently been on some variation of the CGM for years, but always searching for more moisture, less frizz, etc. Recently learned the Gospel of Porosity, did the water bowl test and discovered I have low porosity hair. Current routine:  Tresemme Botanique Nourish and Replenish to co-wash, Shea Moisture baobo and tea tree oils low porosity protein free conditioner to condition, washing that out with cold water, setting with Kinky Curly Knot Today and Kinky Curly Curling Custard, then blowdrying (cold air and a diffuser). This sets the curls in the gel case which I then break. My hair feels soft and nice.   I am also cleansing weekly with Suave Clarifying Shampoo, which really helps clean out excess buildup but also leaves me dried out. I have also just started deep conditioning with Jessicurl Deep Conditioner, and a heat cap, once a week. I guess I'm just looking for how to keep my hair getting more moisture, less frizz, and looking prettier and prettier. This sub has been such a great help already so thank you so much!!!   
Pic one- fresh out the shower, gelled.   Pic two- blow dried, not completely dry tho   Pic three- more dry, gel case not yet broken   Pic four- just pre gel break   Pic five- just post gel break   Pic six- front view, post gel break   Pic seven- post gym, late in the day- frizz is back!   Pic eight- top view, post gym, late in the day"
Dodapdado,dhjae1,"I find if I have a good amount of frizz I will twist some oil (argon or almond of coconut, depending on what I think my hair needs) into individual curls. Just like rub it into my hands then twirl the curl around one of my fingers.

It's not an everyday things, just when they need some extra help."
KareBexar,dhjae1,"For me, I don't put more products in after it's already drying. If it's drying frizzy that means (for me) that I didn't use enough when it was wet. Have you experimented with using more product before you start drying so you don't need to add anything after?"
amandageanna,dhjae1,"Post air-dry products?&&&I've been on the CG method for about 2 weeks and definitely seeing positive change so far. I noticed that no one really discusses products they put in their hair AFTER drying (be it air-dry or defusing). It could be that I need more product in my hair while washing, or just that I'm new to the program, but wondering if anyone has a recommendation for a great post-dry product? Just to combat a bit of frizz and flyaways, and hold everything nicely together before I go out. Any suggestions (CG approved products of course) are greatly appreciated!&&&Yep, this is exactly what I need to do. I just need to get over the fact that it going to feel like I‚Äôm putting in a ton! Thanks for the help&&&Great idea! Bought a little mini thing of oil for this. Thanks so much&&&That‚Äôs impressive! I will keep that in mind for when I wake up and it needs some help. Just so hard when I have to shower at night, especially since I‚Äôm always tossing around at night. I will probably grab the satin pillowcase eventually (tried a sleep cap thing one time). Either way, all good advice. Thank you!"
kylielapelirroja,dhjae1,"I also have a good amount of frizz which gets worse the more I touch my hair (so spritzing with water and SOTC makes it worse every day after wash day). I haven‚Äôt found a non silicone solution to it as of yet. I do use a t-shirt or microfiber towel for SOTC which helps a little. I also sleep on a satin pillowcase, which helps a little too. I try not to touch my hair if I can avoid it.

(My post wash day routine is to spritz with water and conditioner until damp, let dry and then SOTC with a little more gel. I can make it about 5 days to the next wash day with this.)"
meliforniaks,dhiysg,"I can't speak to the protein treatments (still figuring that out myself), but I also have very fine hair and was afraid of leave-in conditioner until recently. After some experimenting, I found that the best option for me is to wash/condish or co-wash as usual, then squish in a smaller amount of conditioner starting about halfway from the tips of my hair (mine is just below my shoulders when wet). I *do not* use leave-in at my roots, just the bottom half of my hair, thus avoiding the extra weight at my roots. So far it's working like a charm!"
thatonewallflower,dhiysg,"Update re: protein treatments and questions about leave-in conditioner&&&So I have done two rice water rinses and one gelatin treatment (three separate) times since my last post on here. My hair has gotten a slightly more consistent clumps but not much change and I am getting frustrated, thinking that I am doing either of these treatments wrong. 

I didn't wash my hair today because I already clarified it the night before with the Live Clean Apple Cider Vinegar. The gelatin treatment I did with marisacurls formula, gelatin with ACV and the manuka yougurt protein treatment from shea moisture mixed in, and it seemed to be going well.

KareBexar,dhivwd,Have you done a clarifying shampoo since the cut? Maybe the stylist used something with silicone that is lingering on your hair.
like_doesitmatter,dhivwd,"Short hair doesn't like my long hair's routine&&&I recently cut my hair really short after a botched haircut, which was a mistake, but there's no going back so. But before I cut my hair I felt like I finally got my routine down. I'd shampoo with any cg shampoo I had (I have a lot) every couple of weeks, condition with NYM pink bottle, deep condition with NYM green deep condition jar, and style with shea moisture's smoothie.

But now my hair feels weighed down, dry, frizzy, and won't curl.

I'm driving myself crazy over what the problem could be. 

I know I'm prone to protein overload so I stopped using SM, but that hasn't really helped. And apparently too much moisture can actually make your hair dry, but I don't want to add protein and backtrack if protein overload is actually the problem. 

Any suggestions?&&&Yea, I clarify with VO5 shampoo every couple of months, or if I accidentally come into contact with anything not cg. I did one recently thinking that might remedy the situation but nothing changed.  My current stylist doesn't use anything on my hair."

Samimation,dhhzrm,Why the volumize instead of maintain? I cant figure out which of the 3 to try.. coconut oil breaks me out so its between maintain and volume. My hair takes days to get oily. I wash it once a week with shampoo and a cowash halfway between every once in a while.

7000s,dhhvxe,"It really depends on how dark your starting hair color is is, which indicates how many bleaching sessions it would take to get to your desired color, and how spaced out would you be willing to do these sessions so it doesn‚Äôt get that damaged. I double (triple of you count the final root bleach) processed my hair in one day which I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily endorse to everyone and it‚Äôs doing really well and it looks and feels fine. You can pay a little extra (or a lot depending on the salon/cost of living in your city) to have protective products like olaplex 1&2 applied during the bleach and then continue to use olaplex 3 as needed at home. I found my hair gets curlier every time I do an olaplex 3 mask and I‚Äôm a big fan. I doubt it‚Äôs CGM approved but I swear by it and also make sure to really listen to your hair needs post bleach and go ham on deep conditioning. I think olaplex 3 is 28 dollars USD and one bottle lasted me 4 uses. Textbook CGM method is anti-bleach but ultimately it‚Äôs your hair and if you think it‚Äôll make you happy I‚Äôd say go for it!! Consider your hair current health and how upset you‚Äôd be if the worst happened and your hair got super damaged. Try a strand test (you can ask for it at the salon or do it at home) if you want to get a feel for how your hair would react to bleach and w that info go from there! Good luck either way."
mylifeas_b,dhhvxe,Don‚Äôt have advice on hair color but I started off with the Shea moisture products and I just switched away from it. It was waaaay too heavy for my hair. My hair constantly looked greasy even on wash day. I started using Deva Curl this week and so far I‚Äôm liking the results.
stayinschoolchirren,dhhvxe,"Would dying my hair be a good idea and any hair product recommendations ?&&&Sorry if this request might be annoying but I want to get a split hair dye and I‚Äôm not sure if it would be a good idea. I have type 2 c to 3a curly hair . I‚Äôm trying to work a hair routine down , what works and what doesn‚Äôt . My hair gets frizzy and kinda puffy throughout the day .
I currently use Not Your Mother's Naturals Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter Curl Defining Shampoo , As I am Cowash conditioner and Shea moisture curl , and SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I  be tried using a diffuser and failed. I kinda need advice on hair products and to what degree would dying my hair damage it"
