Bekahsaurus,7ow48t,"You are so sweet for even caring!!! Awww, you've made my night!"
Callmeshawty2,7ow48t,My friend used straighteners now her hair looks like washed out stringy burnt perm.. it doesnt look good snd she wished she never straightened and ruined her hair.. also i take coconut oil vitamins and they have helped my hair after I have damaged it once. Light oil sprays sometimes just put on my hands and scrunch thru hair. No mousse thats so 80’s lol 
Curly_Edi,7ow48t,"I think compliments when you see it curly will be a good place to start.

Then for her birthday try and make her a little info pack on the CG method and techniques printed out, and give some shampoo, conditioner and a styling product that are CG approved. Ask your parents to contribute too if it's a bit expensive. "
MuhamnadAli,7ow48t,My little sister is always straightening out her beautiful curls because it is easier to manage. Can I get some advice for her? I’m her brother so not much help.&&&
WickedLilThing,7ow48t,"Awww that's so sweet!  I was just like this in HS.  I hated my hair and could never manage it.  I used to joked that it was possessed and needed an exorcism.  The best thing I've done to change my routine for the better is use DevaCurl products.  Lo-poo and the decadence shampoo.  I don't brush unless I'm washing.  I also alternate between washing and co-washing (washing with conditioner only).  When I co-wash I let the conditioner set for at least 30 minutes.  If I want crisp curls I usually go for the DevaCurl curl definer and the gel.  Also, it's important to scrunch the hair while drying/putting in product and to use a microfiber towel!"
static_sea,7ow48t,"My best advice is to read the sidebar for tips. Shampooing infrequently, using leave-in conditioner, ""plopping"" hair and putting it is a silk bonnet at night are the things that most reliably allow me to not look like I've stuck my finger in an electrical socket, so maybe start with that? I'm not much help but I at least wanted to tell you that you seem like a very sweet older brother."
stilljustguessing,7ow48t,A good book called Curl Girl: The Handbook by Lorraine Massey can often be found through Inter-library loan ... maybe casually leaving a copy around where she'd see it?
JadenCheshireCat,7ow2mu,"Personally, I find asking for lots of layers improves the volume of my 2b/2c/3a curls. Then when I am home, I style my hair the way I normally would and cut each curl the way I want it to look (normally just cut it to make the curls clump together better). 

I haven't had a Devacut, but I've gone to a place that specializes in curly hair and the dry cut was $100. I personally think my own trial and error curl cut looks better because I understand what my hair normally looks like better. 😂

Of course this depends your curls, but I suggest you look at online tutorials. I find that cutting at the crook of the curl is the most important tip, explained in this video below.

Good luck!"
TalleyZorah,7ow2mu,"Honestly, as hairdresser, there's nothing special about a Devacut... meaning it's literally how they teach us in school to cut curly hair. It's the ""default"" technique to cut curly hair. Cutting hair like this takes a bit longer, so many hairdressers will 'cut corners' by cutting like a straight haircut, even taking it so far as to straighten hair before cutting it. Your absolute best bet is to look at stylists' portfolios. Every single one of them is going to have social media showing off their work-- look for it/ask to see it! This will tell you immediately if she can handle what you're looking for. You can always ask that they cut it using the descriptions of a devacut, and show her pictures! We *love* pictures. Again though, when choosing a stylist, look at a portfolio, first. "
divalicious24,7ow2mu,"I wanna cut my hair but I don’t have the funds for a Devacut right now,what else can I do instead or what should I tell the hairdresser If she doesn’t specialize in curly hair?&&&&&&Isn’t it rude to ask for their portfolios and then leaving if I don’t like what I see?

jeswell_then,7otz2x,"What am I doing wrong?&&&For the past year or so i have been working to adjust my haircare routine to no avail. I’m starting to get a little desperate and would really love some help evaluating my routine to see where I am going wrong. (And im sorry for not linking anything and if any formatting is wrong, I am on mobile)  

My hair is just past shoulder length, I would say medium porosity, it has been colored (mostly toned).  I’m somewhere between a 2c - 3a.  

A few years ago routine:  
*washed with Purology’s shampoo and conditioner (the purple bottle)  
*used John Frieda’s Frizz Ease Mousse and diffused.   
That was the best working routine for more than a couple of years until my hair/scalp suddenly started getting really oily and it just didn’t work anymore.   

Last year’s routine:  
My stylist switched me to the following shampoo/conditioner:  
*evo’s Gluttony shampoo and conditioner  
* I still tried using the John Frieda mousse but it didn’t really work the same way it used to (I was really frizzy).  
*switched to evo’s the therapist conditioner  
*started using John Frieda’s frizz ease nourishing oil in combination with devacurl’s Ultra Defining Gel. 
 * diffused until 3/4 dry

This seemed to do the trick temporarily but i was still much frizzier and less defined than I would like. Due to some ongoing oiliness issues in my scalp, I clarified once a week with Purology’s clarifying shampoo (green bottle)  

So something about this past year hasn’t been doing me much good. Still frizzy, feeling like my curls just have no life (not so much weighted down but, just blah.) So in a move of desperation, I took advantage of a sale at my local health food store and bought the following products (all on the HG list):  
*giovanni smooth as silk deep moisture shampoo  
*giovanni tea tree triple treat invigorating conditioner  
* Giovanni frizz be fine oil, combined with...
* Giovanni l. a. Natural styling gel  
  
Same. Results. Just frizz and undefined curls.   

Other things:  
* just today, I did an Aphogee two step protein treatment. My hair definitely seems softer and stronger but so far, it hasn’t done anything to my curl shape.   
*i plan on getting some of the Giovanni leave in conditioner.   
*i do need a trim.   

What am I doing wrong? Is it the way I am layering products? Is my hair just fickle? 


&&&The Giovanni products are on the product list in the sidebar. All of the stuff from before (aside from the devacurl Gel) are not. &&&Sorry for the late reply, it's been a really busy past couple of days. But! I've been trying a few different things, like you suggested. I'm waiting on a trim (the girl I trust to do my cuts moved salons and her prices changed, so I'm saving up) so while I'm sure that will affect my ends dramatically for the better, it's just going to have to wait. I'm also going to look into more info about curly cuts so I can talk with her about what she thinks.  

I air dried my hair the other day. It is pretty soft. My shafts are on the thinner side, I just have a LOT of hair. I tried diffusing from the bottom and then only hitting my roots to give it some lift and that seemed to work a little better. I'm hoping that I don't have to air dry every time I wash because 1) I hate the feeling of wet hair (my neck gets so humid!) and 2) it takes forever and 3) I'm a morning shower person, so in order for me to be presentable for work, I'd have to wake up and shower at 5am. And friends, I just love sleep too much.  

Per /u/nemicolopterus suggestion, I started doing squish to condish the right way (not rinsing!) and then adding gel to my very wet hair on top of that. While that has given me a LOT more definition, my hair feels *disgusting.* Heavy, weighed down, somewhat greasy. I still get some frizz from it, though. So I'll need to do some more troubleshooting.  

I know that the real issue will need to be committing to making changes in order to see results. And I also know that I'm not the only one who has budgetary constraints. I would love to purchase all of the perfect products and be immediately on my way to success. I just simply don't have that disposable of an income at the moment. So we'll have to go about this slowly and make-shift until times are a little bit better. I will see if this shop will let me return or exchange the bad shampoo and oil I was using in favor of a new, more CG-friendly shampoo.  

Here is a link for two photos taken today. The one with the text is from this morning. The one that is a little washed out was taken post 6-mile-in-the-humidity-and-drizzly-rain run this evening. http://bit.ly/2DjsbmJ 
 
Thank you all (also /u/ktothebo as well!) for your patience and help. Once upon a time my curls were fine. I don't know what happened along the way. But we'll fix them."
luminous_delusions,7otz2x,"So, your curls are actually not bad! You've got a lot of body and it looks like volume isn't much of an issue, but your main hurdles are frizz and definition along with dryness (your ends look fuzzy to me). Others have already addressed product issues that you can look into (so much of your stuff has silicones and you're not using a sulfate shampoo to remove them that I'm inclined to think it's a big factor too though) so I'll touch on other possible causes.

Get the trim first off. From the pictures it seems like your layers are pretty grown own and might need tinkering with. I don't know if it's just me but it looks like you have some layers that are pretty significantly shorter than your longest parts which could be causing issues because your hair isn't able to clump like it wants to. Some of the curls on the very top and back of your head look great but it appears like the bottom sections are the ones lacking definition the most. That was first thought from looking at your photos; your hair looks just like mine when I end up with layers too short and need to bring up the bottom to get it back in shape.

I know for me (similar hair type) that I need to keep my layers from going too short in comparison to my longest section otherwise I end up with my hair looking lifeless and half limp and it fights me on definition. I've tried many times to do the heavy layering a lot of people here like but always end up having to cut off a bunch to bulk up the bottom of my hair to get it to curl right. Longer layers (or no layers at all) are better for some curlies.

Frizz could be due to the diffusing. How soft is your hair with no product at all? Soft or fine hair sometimes has trouble with diffusing. I can't diffuse my hair at all without it turning into a ball of frizz and entirely disrupting my curl pattern (not because I'm not doing it right either, my hair is just too soft to tolerate it and the airflow blows too many of my little hairs out of their clumps). Have you tried air drying entirely at all just to see if that helps with your frizz issues?"
nemicolopterus,7otz2x,"I'm not familiar with those products. Are they CG? Did you do a clarifying rinse with a sulfate shampoo before going CG?

If you're not CG or not interested in doing it (doesn't work for everyone! Totally cool) then ignore these! It's just the best method I know for healthy happy curly hair so thought I'd ask. 

Good luck!!"
ariannalancia,7osuqb,"Tried a new ""refresh"" routine&&&&&&Today I refreshed my day 2 curls by sprizting them with water mixed with Cantu curl activator cream. I got my hair quite wet, scrunched a bit with a t-shirt and let it air dry. It took longer then usual to air dry as usually when I refresh my hair I just get it a bit damp, next time I'll try to diffuse instead and see how it turns out. But I'm happy with these results, I'll definitely try it again "
imnotukrainian,7osujz,Damn!!! That sucks to hear. I want to pick them both up. I too have a similar curl type that’s high porosity and super fine. :( I’m going to try them regardless. I assumed by the smell and the look of the bottle that it had to be light weight 😂 I really hope they work out 
nemicolopterus,7osujz,"Kinky curly Knot Today. By itself it just weights down my super fine high porosity hair. Combined with Kinky Curly Curling Custard it is the perfect light gel/leave-in combo that emphasizes my curls, dries fast, and scrunched out to perfection every time. &&&Do I have a downvote fairy? Who is downvoting me and why? I consistently see downvotes on random posts like this and I'm not sure why. "
t-funny,7osujz,"Curly hair products you hated but then you loved.&&&So...i'm a hair stylist..and i work at a aveda salon. and i hated the aveda curly stuff. never worked well.

i switched to unwash's conditioner and devacurl's supercream and fell in love. i've been using it for a year but then i ran out and went broke. so i grabbed some of my salon's be curly curl enhancer and put it in my hair and started getting ready for my frizzy mess that i knew would happen...but it never did. instead it made my curls bouncy and light and now they don't just fall on my head and look super good.

i'm guessing i just didn't use it properly.

anyways. what are some products that you hated but then gave it another chance and it worked out even better"

iatebugs,7osjou,The second one has silicones so it would not be good to use. You'd need a shampoo with sulfate to remove the silicone (which is definitely not recommended).

effRPaul,7orb9g,I put glycerin on my face and it looks fantastic as long as there's some humidity. If there's low humidity it sucks all the moisture out of my skin 
yismet,7orb9g,"My husband used my curly hair gel as a face cleanser...and his skin looked great! (x-post r/skincareaddiction)&&&My husband's normal skincare routine is occasionally ~~stealing~~ using my cleanser, moisturizer, and/or sunscreen. His face looked really good yesterday - glowing and supple- so I complimented him. His answer? ""Thanks, I used your face wash in the shower and put on moisturizer!""

I simply stared at him. My face wash (cosrx good morning gel cleanser) wasn't in the shower - he had used my precious curl gel cream! I had decanted it into a smaller, unlabeled bottle for travel.

Turns out, the ingredients of my hair gel (Bounce Curl Light Creme Gel) actually have a pretty good [cosdna analysis] (http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_524f331453.html) and they include jojoba, aloe, ginseng root, and glycerin (perhaps it could also be a moisturizer too :P). I actually got the recommendation for it from this sub, and I absolutely love it! Unfortunately, I live in Europe and its really hard for me to get - I am down to the last 1/3 of the bottle.

*I am in no way recommending that anyone should use this hair gel as a cleanser or moisturizer, it was just really comical that he used it and his skin looked fantastic."
SunnyHillside,7or3b5,"My EASY routine that works for me!&&&https://i.imgur.com/eQXAoyz.jpg 

Before getting in the shower I brush my hair out. 

Then the first thing I do when I get in the shower is wash my hair with whatever shampoo I have (shampoo doesn’t seem to have any impact). I’ve used head and shoulders or pricey stuff... I typically wash twice. 

I then rince the shampoo and use pureology curl conditioner (I’ve prob tried 100 different conditioners and this one works every time). I put my head upside down away from the water (so water is hitting my butt) and gently comb my hands through my hair removing tangles (adding more conditioner as needed - I probably end up with at least two quarter sizes when all is said and done). 

With head still upside down I twist my hair extremely gently trying not to loose any water/conditioner and then I bring my head back up and squeeze the twisted hair onto the top of my head like a bun so the conditioner seeps into my scalp. 

Then I shave my legs, wash my face, enjoy the hot water.

Then I turn my head back over and wash with ICE COLD water. I’ve got a pull down shower head so I don’t spray my body with the cold water. Sometimes I’ll get cold doing this so once I’m done rinsing I’ll put my hair back on my head again and run hot water over my body before getting out. 

I towel dry a bit and swing my head back upside down and gently brush out. Then I braid it while still upside down and go to sleep. I unbraid it in the morning and it looks like this. So easy... 

I used to French braid it before bed but I noticed my hairline getting thinner prob because it was pulling my hair all night. Braiding with your head upside down looks awful but gives you lots of wiggle room/isn’t tight in your head. And it is easier to sleep because the braid is already on top of your head! Twofer! 

I used to have to use the curling iron or other products but this routine gives me amazing results. I can’t leave the house without getting compliments!&&&Thank you!!!"

finallycurly,7oql07,"I finally figured out a super easy, one-product routine that works for me. Happy to share with others of you who are as impatient as I am with hair!&&&&&&This is the only routine I've actually been able to stick to because I've just absolutely refused, my entire life, to spend more than 10 minutes a day on my hair, no matter how much I want it to look good. I know it's not quite as magnificent as the other curls I see on this site, but it works for me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

So, when I am in the shower, the last thing I do is (softly) brush my hair with conditioner still in it to untangle. Then, I flip my head over so my head is upside down and is super wet. I gently brush through it again, squeeze out some of the excess water (but not all of it, should still be pretty wet). Make sure to keep a little bit of the conditioner in there; don't rinse all of it out. Then I run some [Paul Mitchell Super Sculpt](https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Mitchell-Super-Sculpt-Styling/dp/B0009OMNJI/) throughout all of it, making sure it's all coated. I end up using two quarter-sized amounts. Once I'm sure it's coated, I scrunch up from the bottom, squeezing some of the water out as I do, making sure all of the hair is now curled. There should be a satisfying squelchy sound. Then I flip my hair back over and **don't touch it** until it's completely dry (about 2-3 hours later), when I scrunch up a little bit from the bottom again the places where the gel has set a bit harder. Super easy & fast, every time I shower. If it's on a day I don't want to shower, I just wet my hair and do the same thing outside of the shower. &&&Thanks! I got them online at Coastal.com. [Here's the link!](https://www.coastal.com/glasses/7-for-all-mankind/7-for-all-mankind-7906-50)&&&Yeah, it does.&&&Thanks! I'm currently using Biolage for both shampoo & conditioner.

on deep conditioning days, such as they day i took this pic, i use a good fingertips worth of cantu curl activator cream, cantu repair leave in conditioner, coconut oil, olive oil, auntie jackie’s curl la la, and cantu coconut curling cream and don’t be afraid to get a lot, although too much will make your curls limp. let sit in plastic bag and wrap that with a cotton tee for 30-45 minutes and rinse with your normal conditioner. 
and on cowash days i just put in the normal conditioner and follow above steps 
5-11. And remember, my hair routine may not work for you. &&&also, feel free to leave any advice or comments! thank u!!"
Skippy28,7opbp5,I’ve been following this subreddit for a while now and haven’t gotten started on working with my curly hair for this exact reason. Devacurl seems to be the holy grail and when I found it at the store my excitement dropped at the price tag. And the sidebar has so many suggestions I got overwhelmed and stopped. I just don’t know where to start. :(
SolidSpruceTop,7opbp5,I bought a two pack of 32oz nopoo and condish for $50 on Amazon. A couple ppl got fakes but it seems fine to me
TheBeatles60-70,7opbp5,"Dupes for Devacurl?&&&So, as we all know, Devacurl is EXPENSIVE. Especially for a student on a budget. My question is, what have you guys found that works almost or exactly like certain Devacurl products. If you could list the Devacurl product, the dupe, and the differences if any, that would be so great! I feel like this thread could help a lot of curlies actually. Thanks in advance, lovelies! "
basylica,7opbp5,"I got a devacurl set and TBH I found the shampoo and conditioner unimpressive, gel was OK but nothing to write home about, and the styling cream made me realize my hair likes cream products (just a smidge) but I also bought some kids Cantu cream and it’s waaayyyy cheaper, smells better, and easier to dispense than the revel bottle of deva.

TBH the smell of the shampoo and conditioner makes me gag. Smells like old lady to me. *shrug*

I guess I don’t get the hype.

I went a product buying spree after my 3yr routine stopped working very well and I’m still figuring out what I like but so far I’ve been alternating deva gel and curls blueberry gel. Yes to carrots conditioner does nothing for me, but yes to coconuts is awesome. And I’m really loving the leavein conditioner and curly custard from mop top. Now that’s a smell I LOVE. 

I used to Cowash with suave, tresseme naturals leavein and then gel. Then I’d use shea hibiscus or water/conditioner spray to refresh.

Lately I’ve been trying out shampoo/conditioner/cowash and using a dime size of the mop top leavein, curl custard, and then gel after. Then a small (toothpaste sized?) ammt of the Cantu once my hair is dry and then to refresh before bed.

I took pics 3 days in a row of using the Cantu and while troubleshooting why my curls suddenly went flat. Day 1 was flat and lack luster and all I did was use Cantu before bed the next 2 days and day 3 looked night and day. Even when I look at the pics it’s hard to believe it’s really 3 days in a row without washing!

boonslinger,7opbp5,"no poo: literally just scrubbing suave essentials conditioner into my scalp for 5 minutes, it has the same effect

one condition: this product didn't really work for me, but a conditioner i use now (and love) that has a similar slip is tresemme perfectly undone

i unfortunately haven't found any satisfactory dupes for the styling products"
epipin,7opbp5,"Not really a dupe, but the closest results I have had to Devacurl One Condition Original has been the Not Your Mother’s Naturals Tahitian Gardenia and Mango Butter conditioner. My hair looks pretty much identical on day 1, but by day 2 and 3 I notice that my hair is not holding the curl as well (especially the grays) and seems drier with NYM than when I use the Devacurl. Still, no other conditioner I have tried so far will give me even the good day 1 results so it’s good enough for me to keep it in rotation to keep my costs down. SheaMoisture for example seems to turn everything to straw for me lately.

[I have fine hair, mostly 3a but some 3b on day 1, and some 2c by the time day 3 comes around. I use Devacurl low poo original for shampoo.]"
imnotukrainian,7opbp5,"I’ve seen discounted devacurl on Poshmark. Usually it’s unopened, or a person has tried it and decided they didn’t like it so they post it for sale there. You can submit offers on things and I’m pretty sure your first purchase is free shipping. ☺️"
katethegreat4,7opbp5,"I second the beginners routine...I used Deva Curl for the better part of two years, and by the time I finally gave up on it, my hair was looking pretty lackluster. I'm using the beginners products right now (TRESemme botanique nourish and replenish and LA Looks blue sport gel) and my hair looks, feels, and smells way better. The only change I made to the beginner routine was to cowash with Suave Everlasting Sunshine before using the TRESemme as a rinse out, because my hair has not reacted well to strictly cowashing in the past. All of that being said, Yes to Carrots nourishing conditioner is supposed to be pretty close to Deva Curl one condition if you want to give that a shot. I don't know of any other dupes"
loverules2,7opbp5,"Omg I thought I was the only one, the smell of their products makes me want to gag too! "
mcroro,7opbp5,"I love most Devacurl products, but I never buy them at full price. I signed up for a loyalty card and promos from CVS - I constantly get emails for 30-40% off of a single item. I wait for those and buy the Devacurl products I want one at a time! "
nemicolopterus,7opbp5,There's a new super simple and super cheap beginners routine in the wiki. Highly recommended :) (I'm not baised)
tica-puravida,7opbp5,"There is a group on fb "" curly girls! (Conditioner -washing group for woman)&&&There is a brand called lovely curls that you can find at bed, bath and beyond.  I haven't tried it thou but heard it is almost as good as deva curl. I use a conditioner from sallys called GVP conditioning balm "
