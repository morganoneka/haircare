surebegrandlike,iwszfy,Hey there’s a sub for that 😊 r/curlyhairUK
tinyplantprincess,iwszfy,"UK/ Ireland brand and product recommendations please!&&&I'm moving back to Scotland after many years of school- during which I discovered the magic of caring properly for my hair (very dense, very long, high porosity, 2B/2C/3A, favorite hobby is to FRIZZ)! I'll also be spending a lot of time in Ireland over the next year or so. I'm no longer familiar with a lot of the brands back home other than the ones that are sold in the US as well. 

I'd love to hear about the brands and products you guys love that are available in the UK or Ireland or both! I'm fairly faithful to CG products but I'm very open to things that are not-quite-CG as well. Special points given to recommendations that are easy to find- at Boots, etc. Extra special points given if the brands are woman/ POC owned, small companies, or local to the Isles.&&&Wow, I didn't realize! Thank you so much!! Can't wait to dive in&&&Thanks!!"
Whatsername_2020,iwst7l,"I like Not Your Mother's Curl Talk line! They've got a cream and gel.  Recently I have been seeing a lot of folks loving it on YouTube and saying it is a decent DevaCurl dupe! (Only much more affordable and not terrifying to use)

Edit: their gel is not strong hold, but when I use it with their mouse and cream it does a good job for me. ( Have super thick 2c/3a hair)"
djg123,iwst7l,"I need a new curl cream and gel!&&&Hello curlies!  I am a recent DevaCurl quitter - it's been about a month and so far so good.  I have switched to Giovanni for wash and condition products.  Unfortunately, my hair does not like their styling products!  

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions for a defining curl cream and strong hold gel that are good for fine, thin hair??  TIA for any suggestions!"
xdreamingdahlia,iwst7l,"I like the Miss Jessie’s no crunch gel (white bottle with pink writing)! I love using it after a curl cream and then diffusing my hair. For reference, i have fine 2c/3a type curls"
Bike_Pretty,iwsrpg,"First of all, you hair is beautiful and looks luscious. You might feel like you are missing hair, but it looks like you have lots of it!

Secondly, that’s a very normal part configuration, especially for wavies. A lot of us have a swirly cowlick right at the fontanelle spot. I asked my hair dresser and she showed me how to do some very light backcombing to cover that little bit.

ashikatheninja,iws1nn,"Breakouts with CGM?&&&Does anyone else get major breakouts on their scalp/face with having so many products in and leaving them in for so long?  If I sleep with products in my hair, they get all over my pillow and I get acne all over my face. So day 2+ curls are out. I’ve tried sleeping in head scarves, but that just smooshes the product against my scalp... and I’ve tried pineapple-ing, but it still gets on my pillow/face. The only thing that helps is washing my hair at night and then getting it wet again in the morning, but then I’m doing the whole routine every day, which is not ideal. And just having so many products in my hair at all seems to be making my scalp break out too. 

Anyone else dealing with this? Any pointers?&&&That’s what I do. My face still breaks out from being on the product covered pillow all night. 😕&&&When I do that, it’s still all mushed up onto my scalp and my scalp breaks out..."
mooshu1x2,iws1nn,I would simple put your hair in a bonnet at night so that the products do not get absorbed in the pillowcase and in your face. Also frequently wash your pillow cases and keep a good face wash routine.
rhinoray29,iws1nn,"Sounds like my issue. I have really finicky, acne prone skin. My hair doesn’t seem to absorb much, but my skin sure does! Your issues you mentioned sound a lot like mine. FWIW, don’t think mine is an allergic reaction. 

I’m still trying to figure out a proper solution though. I finally found a skin care routine that works, and I got excited and dove into CGM and it all went up in flame again, haha. 

I’m trying Giovanni smooth as silk for co wash and conditioner, I leave in a tiny amount still and wear a bonnet to bed. My skin is *slightly* better  since I cut out the Giovanni LA style gel, but still working to get my skin health back.

I also use Johnson and Johnson’s baby shampoo for my weekly shampoo... not totally sold on that solution in terms of frequency and the impact on my hair, but I am POSITIVE that one doesn’t make me break out. Good luck :)"

alsohotwheels,iwr3s2,"Best. Wash. Day. Ever.&&&&&&I started CGM in March when quarantine began here in the US and I was sent home from college. Since then I have deviated slightly with products but starting Full CGM helped me reset and control my hair!

Today was clarifying wash day & this is the best hair day I have had since I discovered that my hair is curly! My whole life I was one of those humans who had “hair that is frizzy and poofy and unmanageable and undefined”. 

My typical routine:

1. Fully soak hair in shower
2. Co-Wash with Curlsmith Curl Quenching Conditioning Wash, massage scalp with silicone shampoo brush, finger detangle 
3. Squish to Condish in the co-wash, upside down 
4. Fully rinse
5. Wrap soaking hair with The Perfect Haircare Towel
6. Remove towel and scrunch in Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk Curl Cream upside down
7. Generously apply Curlsmith Curl Defining Styling Soufflé and scrunch in upside down
8. Plop in t shirt for 10-15 minutes
9. Diffuse upside down with Bed Head Diffusing Dryer until 80% dry using the Manes by Mell method
10. Air dry, SOTC

*Deep Condition 1x a week using Maui Moisture Shea Butter Hair Mask (purple tub)
*Clarifying Wash using V02 Clarifying Shampoo every two weeks"
galaxyhump,iwr2h2,"I have a similar hair texture to you, and for me, I find that washing every other day works best for me. In between washes I co-wash. 

As for products, it depends on how easily your hair gets weighed down. I personally use a leave-in conditioner, mousse, a curl lotion, and gel. Mousse is a good start, and if you feel like your hair needs more products, you can always add the other options i mentioned above.

Not dry brushing is surprisingly easy to get used to. Just detangle in the shower with some conditioner and you're set. Keep your hair pulled up at night and sleep on a satin/silk pillowcase to avoid tangles and frizz.

Now for product brands!!! I love Aussie so so so much!! They're super cheap and it works wonders on my hair. My hair feels so hydrated and my curls have never looked better. I got a buttload of products for like $20 something a few days ago."
ohnevelmynevel,iwr2h2,"I want to try using the curly girl method but I’m nervous to go shampoo and brush free, how did you first adjust to it? what product works best for you? my curl type is between 2c to 2b so is it ok for me to shampoo at least once a week?&&&I’m going to finally use the curly girl method full force because I’m so fed up with only having curls underneath while the top layers are basically straight, I didn’t know before looking it up that the method recommends going curl free and that is really daunting because how will I clean my hair? 

I’m also nervous about tangles as while I do hate how brushing makes my hair look I don’t know how I’ll be able to prevent tangles from happening and since the method advises against brushing how will I get them out? 

The only hair product I own for my curls right now is some curl mousse because the gel is daunting to me, I am obviously looking for other products but because my hair isn’t the curliest I don’t want to grease it up with something it can’t handle. 

The only thing that’s extremely easy about this method is no heat and no coloring, I’ve always kept my hair natural but only recently have I started caring for it correctly. 

Any advice/product recommendations is appreciated(just as an fyi for recommendations I’m on a pretty tight budget right now so cheap but quality is what I’m looking for)."
red_210,iwr2h2,"Shampooing is still totally fine, lots of people do it, but you might hear them talk about ""low poo"", which just means that the shampoo they use only have gentle cleansing ingredients. Run the ingredients lists of shampoos through curlsbot.com or isitcg.com to see if they're suitable for curly girl method.

I personally use a low poo about once a week, and then co-wash (use a conditioner that has cleansing ingredients to wash my hair) in between if I feel I need it.

Brushing is also still definitely a thing, the big no-no is DRY brushing. It's best to do any detangling while you're in the shower and with a bit of conditioner in your hair. You can use your fingers, or a wide tooth comb, or a wet brush (a specific kind of brush, not just any brush).

Depending on the thickness of your hair, mousse could be a good styling product for you. Those with 2a/b/c curls often have fine hair, and mousse can work really well for them. I think gel is amazing, but it can be daunting when you first start cause technique is really important when you use it, so I'd suggest using the mousse that you have, and then trying out gel if you find the mousse doesn't work for you.

I've personally found that technique is more important than products. Expensive products can be great but nothing I use costs more than $20AUD. The best thing for figuring out if products are cgm is curlsbot.com and isitcg.com. You may be able to find country specific product lists, but I've found those two websites the best help for me, especially if I'm trying to figure out if budget products are cgm approved."

- Air-dry (no touching)

Dye is lunar tides rainbow pack&&&Luck I'm afraid :( I make sure my hair is super detangled because I find the curls get messed up by them&&&So first I singled out a few curls to do (believe it or not, 8). I bleached them once and they were still pretty orangey so I bleached them again 3 days later until they were as light as I could get them (level 9). I then waited a few days to give my hair a break. I opened all of the dyes and got 6 brushes, and went through and painted each curl with my bf. We started at the top and switched brushes between each color. He found it easier to paint with the foil as a background to my hair. We did about 3 inches of pink (only to cover the poorly bleached top of each curl) and 1 inch of every other color. Then, being super careful not to move the foil, we folded it up. I waited like 4 hours to rinse because I didn't want to rinse too early. 

I mixed a few things into my bleach to protect my hair so it could absorb color better. I went to sallys and got ion brilliance absolute perfection step 2 (olaplex dupe, bond reconstructor) and neutral protein filler. Be careful, if you add a bunch your bleach needs a stronger developer (like 30 instead of 20). I also mix these things with some clear gloss to paint over my dyed hair to seal in the color and hopefully stop the dye from fading.

Sorry this was so long, I added a ton of detail because I get frustrated with the lack of detail most tutorials provide."

GrandmasCheeseBalls,iwpu5z,Do you have a mousse recommendation? I feel like my hair behaves the same as yours!
Kraslie,iwpu5z,"Hair looks really ""flat"" from behind&&&After years of not really taking care of my hair at all i decided to chop it off and start anew, im now at a point in hair growth and have been trying to learn to properly style it for once. After growing it out again i started noticing that on good days i can have fairly [decent](http://imgur.com/a/vq6IxRh) [wavy](http://imgur.com/a/COwSK79) and [curly](http://imgur.com/a/dfSmJ5Q) hair. The curl pattern not being consistent i am fine with, variety is the spice of life, but the bane of my existence the last few months learning to style it has been how to deal with the [hair on the back](http://imgur.com/a/7Ta4fB0) looking so flat.

I have fairly thin low porosity hair, i have reduced my shampoo use down from daily to 2/3 times a week, and use a no brand silicone free conditioner from Aldi. To style, in the first three pictures, i used the curl company's mousse, but as they have discontinued it in the stores, ive started experimenting with gel again, which i sadly think makes my hair look dull and lifeless, the fourth pic is with gel.

I don't think i'm looking for product recommendations as much as i am technique though, i think the issue might be that i plop for too long, which my thin hair probably doesn't take as well as others with thicker hair leaving it flat looking, but ive just not been able to get it to looker fuller in the back. 

Anyone else with a similar hairtype that bumped into the same point om the learning curve?&&&Ttied brushing with my old tangle teaser, and the hair would just form back into clumps since it was wet so thats nifty!

I tried diffusing ""right way up"" and its giving me more definition in the back, but at the cost of a lot of volume i get from washing and diffusing upside down. Might have to experiment to find a happy medium, perhaps washing upside down and diffusing right way up

Thanks for the tips :)&&&For more info on my routine, i wash it upside down, and scrunch in all my products. Ive considered that this might mean that the hair in the back doesn't get scrunched and therefore lacks definition, but i've tried washing it ""normally"" and scrunching in from behind, but it diden't do anything really.&&&As i wrote above i think plopping might be the issue? I assume for people with thicker hair it kind of forces it the clump together into curls but for me it just straps the hair close to my head? Ive not gotten much better results from not plopping, so might just be my curl pattern.

I use a wide tooth comb in the shower, haven't used it to style with. I might try that and finger coiling, then scrunching in mousse/gel."
chillythefrog,iwpu5z,"I find plopping just doesn’t work for us with wavy, fine hair. Every time I plopped the curls at the back and the bottom at the back just never formed nicely, and when Diffusing upside down would cause my hair to clump in all the wrong places so when tipping my head right side up it’d be a flat tangled mess. 

Here’s my routine which is working really well:

- Rinse out all conditioner, and split my hair to two sides so it’s all at the front

- brush my hair using my wet tangle teaser (I know a lot of people say not to brush wet wavy hair for fear of losing clumps, but it gets rid of the tangles caused by moving my hair about in the shower)

- lightly scrunch my hair with a t-shirt. Get as much water out of possible so it’s not sopping wet

- apply mousse (I’ve found gel to be too heavy, and mousse is much easier to work in to my hair. Also gel makes my hair a tangled mess). You can apply this anyway you like, I use a method of praying hands and raking it through my hair

- lightly dry again with t-shirt 

- dry hair with diffuser, with hair still split on either side. This way you can get the back more effectively

And your done!! I’ve found a lot of the things people say you should never do with wavy/fine hair have actually really worked for me. Raking my hair doesn’t cause a problem with clumping for me as long as I then re scrunch my hair. 

I hope those helps :)"
floridameerkat,iwpu5z,Have you ever tried plopping? Or using a denman brush or finger coiling the back section?
GrandmasCheeseBalls,iwnkom,Curls look great! And I just wanted to say we appreciate you for working with covid patients ♥️ You are the best of the best. One day it’ll be over with!!
plateofcorn,iwnkom,So gorgeous! Love the color especially!!!
purebreadbagel,iwnkom,"I’m starting to not hate my hair! Fingers crossed the success isn’t a fluke!&&&&&&Routine that has been a work of trial, error, and spending the last three months with my hair up because it’s been awful. It’s only really started to look decent in the last week or so. 

- Before I get my hair wet once a week (or before I shampoo it) I’ll saturate my hair with 50/50 Grape seed oil and hemp oil mixed with 1% Rosemary Essential Oil and 1% Tea Tree Essential oil and 10% Polysorbate 80 (helps it rinse out better)
- About once a week (different day than the oil usually) I’ll add protein by mixing the neutral protein filler with conditioner (instead of water) and a little bit of oil and applying to my hair and letting it sit for around 10 minutes. I’m out of the protein filler, so I’ll probably try rice water next week- we’ll see where it goes 😂
- If my hair is feeling particularly gross, my scalp is starting to f eel weird or itch, I worked a covid floor, or if my hair is absolutely *not* behaving I’ll shampoo it with either Love, Beauty, and Planet coconut milk and jasmine shampoo or if I used something with silicones in it I’ll use diluted suave clarifying shampoo. 
- Co-wash with Suave Essentials conditioner (whatever scent I happen to pick up that week)
- de tangle with a wide toothed comb
- Squish to condish(I think? I’m probs doing it ‘wrong’ but it works so 🤷‍♀️) with the same conditioner
- Scrunch some excess water out and scrunch in either herbal essence Totally Twisted gel or LA looks sport gel (the blue one). Depending on how it went on I might smooth some more closer to my roots, at my bangs, or the back of my head. 
- If I’m just going to chill and let my hair do whatever for the next few days (or plan on wearing it up most of the time) I’ll just plop it with a turbie twist and let it stay like that until I need to take it off to go somewhere or if it starts to bug me. Then I let it finish drying, SOTC and see what I get. 
- If I actually want my hair to look good and not leave it to chance- I diffuse it with the pixie curls method and make sure before I turn the dryer off on each section I hit it with a blast of cold air to help it hold the wave. 
- Usually it ends up most of the way dry by the time I’m done and if there’s any crunch left I scrunch it out. I might put a little bit of the oil mix I use before washing when I scrunch, but I’ve forgotten 90% of the time.


This looks like a lot, but it doesn’t really feel like it tbh."
