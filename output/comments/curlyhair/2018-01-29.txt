Acierblade,7vcgxi,Now THIS is a kick-ass routine. Well-done.
curlyguy2646,7vcgxi,"Even though my Steelers didnâ€™t play today, my curls absolutely played along today.&&&&&&My routine currently starts with DevaCurl No Poo every few days, maybe once a week or so. I use Suave Essentials conditioner, whatever I can grab that isnâ€™t the coconut one. I squish to condish with it, wash some of it out. A little bit of Kinky Curly Knot Today as a leave-in, then DevaCurl Styling Cream to hold it all together as itâ€™s dripping wet. Pat dry a teeny bit then diffuse blow dry until my arm falls off. "
omgcow,7vcgxi,Your curls look great! And go Steelers! Next year will be our year for sure ;)
rnnybf,7vcgxi,The curls are the real MVP ðŸ˜‚
Curly_Edi,7vboiv,"Have you seen the curly up do thread? Someone shared it with me last week

Steampunk_Gypsy,7vboiv,I twist it up loosely and put in a couple hair sticks and/or pencils. 
ambulancia,7vboiv,"Favorite way to put your hair up!&&&I am so excited for this sub! I just found it, and plan on starting as soon as I can later this week. My problem is that when I work I absolutely need to keep my hair up. I also sometimes sleep at work, (24 hour shifts!) and would like to be able to put it up then too.

So, what's your favorite way to put your hair up without killing your curls? &&&Thank you! &&&Oh my goodness thank you! That's exactly what I was looking for!"
Independent-worm,7vb425,Lovely! Your hair looks so healthy.
Whiskeysneat,7vb425,"A great hair day made me want to look back on when I started CG 8 months ago&&&&&&Oh right! Cowash and condition with tresemme perfectly undone, squish in boots curl creme and then dippity do girls with curls gelee while it's soaking wet, plop for 10-20min and then air dry. I really want to see what diffusing does but I haven't gotten around to getting one yet! "
rnnybf,7vb425,Routine?
capitalismwitch,7vam4t,"day 1 of attempting a curly hair routine. help!&&&&&&I spent years trying to brush my hair straight after my hair went miraculously curly (and frizzy) during puberty. Iâ€™m trying to completely embrace my curls now, but Iâ€™m at a loss as to what exactly to do. 

Routine: 
- Brush out knots with plastic brush meant for horses. 
- Cowash with DevaCurl No Poo 
- Condition with DevaCurl Daily Cream Conditioner and comb with widetooth comb 
- Flip hair sopping wet upside down and put DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel in hair 
- Put hair in microfibre towel from DevaCurl, clip up and let sit for 1 hr 
- Remove towel and let air dry. 

Should I add or change anything from my routine? Whatâ€™s my curl type likely? I donâ€™t use heat on my hair ever (even to blow dry), but would a diffuser be a good investment? Would a hair cut be beneficial? "
ktothebo,7vam4t,"Your hair wants to curl. You can see hints of it all over. I went through this at first, too. Looser curl patterns can take some time to recover from mistreatment. (Iâ€™m a 3A now.) my suggestions, in no particular order:

1. Patience

2.  Why is your hair knotting? Brushing with a horse brush is . . . less than ideal. Sleep with your hair braided. Get a cheap CG conditioner, use it prior to washing, get out the knots with a wide tooth comb, then wash. 

3. Your hair looks really dry. Try using an oil, like olive or coconut at least 30 minutes prior to washing, ideally overnight. Are you leaving in conditioner under the gel? 

4. How much gel are you using? The correct amount is A LOT.  More than that. Nope, still not enough. 

5. If your hair was thinned at your last haircut, that will prevent curl formation. "
musicmagicmayhem,7v9oa8,I have one slightly shorter layer - it's about an inch and a half shorter than the rest of my hair. Breaks up the triangle head look! Bear in mind that my hair reaches my waist when wet so has extra weight to keep things downwards-facing.
nemicolopterus,7v9oa8,"A curly-expert (Deva, or Ouidad) can cut layers that are appropriate for your hair. There are links in the sidebar. Can be hit or miss, but when it's a hit it's usually a MAJOR hit."
vviiv,7v9oa8,"Hair Cut&&&I'm in dire need of a haircut as my ends are dry and I have split-ends. 

I have Botticelli curls and its two inches below the shoulders. I'm thinking of asking for a layered cut. But, I've always heard curly haired girls should stay away from layers - thoughts?"

bitch_youre_22,7v9364,"First time making and using flaxseed gel, I love it!!&&&&&&[Flaxseed Gel recipe](https://youtu.be/os0gI1vx1tw)

Routine: Deep condition with Aussie 3 min miracle (I think). Rinse, squish to condition some Deva Curl conditioner with hea dupside down. Squish with microfiber towel to dry, use Renpure whipped coconut leave in, squish in flaxseed gel generously. Plop with microfiber towel for a while before letting it air dry. Let the hair dry until crunchy and then swuish to break the cast. Results in soft, nicely formed curls!"
mistyokmon,7v8pom,"I just want to shave my head sometimes&&&I have TERRIBLE heat damage! like I thought I had low density hair, but in reality itâ€™s not.....itâ€™s just so damaged from years of heat. My hair is full on the top but gets so stringy in the middle/bottom! Especially the back of my hair is extremely stringy, you can barely tell if my roots are thicker or not because itâ€™s so damaged. I sometimes want to shave my head, but I know I wouldnâ€™t want that. I got a trim a month ago, and itâ€™s too soon for another, but I just want one. Maybe I should get a protective hair style so I donâ€™t have to be reminded everyday of how damaged my hair is. 

Like I have no idea what my hair texture is cause my curls are waves. I try products but it jsut gets poofy/frizzy with no curls. Even when itâ€™s wet, the curls arenâ€™t there.

I started my transition a month ago so I know I have to be patient but I just hate my hair so much right now 

Here is the disaster of my hair 

https://imgur.com/a/Iysbt&&&Can you describe whatâ€™s going on with my hair? Like it looks so thin in some places and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m balding cause you canâ€™t see my scalp (except for my temples but many people have issues with their edges because of tying their hair back). Idk but I never knew that heat damage can really mess up with your hair :/..... itâ€™s been a little over a month so Ik I shouldnâ€™t be sad since itâ€™s too little of time to see progress "
nemicolopterus,7v8pom,"Awwww :( yeah I think we've all been there.

Sorry you're bummed right now. Can we answer any questions while you're here?"
CrimsonStorm43,7v54am,I have the same exact problem! My 18 month old has crazy curls. Iâ€™ve always had pin straight hair so Iâ€™m at a complete loss at what to do! 
ollee32,7v54am,"Curly toddler hair...what do I do?&&&My almost 2 year old daughter has beautiful ringlet curls on the bottom and sides but the top is like a weird straight/wavy frizzy mess. Curly hair is new to me so in my little bit of research Iâ€™ve learned to 1) stop brushing 2) stop washing so often and 3) moisturize...a lot!

Iâ€™m using Shea Moisture products bc I like the smell but Iâ€™m learning people with curly hair like them, so we lucked out there. 

Since Iâ€™ve learned I need to care for it differently, Iâ€™ve started wetting it in the mornings and using bumble and bumble beach waves spray and then scrunching it. It seems to work but it still looks messy...maybe a trim?

Any ideas? Sheâ€™s little so whatever I do canâ€™t involve complicated steps and certainly not a diffuser. "
