allstarfart,8avh41,normal towel or microfibre? a microfibre towel has taken my drying time from 10+ hrs to ~5hrs
nattuggla2608,8avh41,"I'm not sure if I can really help, since I have straight hair and it might be different, but for me certain kinds of conditioners really help. Without them, my hair takes forever to dry, but when I use it and dry it with a towel, it's notably dryer. The rest I dry with a hair dryer and some heat protection spray without silicone. 

Edit: I usually use conditioners without silicone, but I've also used C without S that didn't help at all with the drying process. Just try a few different products and see if it makes a difference. "
redneckgymrat,8avh41,"My hair takes forever to dry, but has never been healthier.&&&I started growing from razored bald and went water-only from the start. This is 15 months of virgin hair, never had a product of any sort touch it, but I cleanse it twice a week on average.
 
My hair and scalp have never been healthier, and it's getting to a length where my curls are asserting themselves.  Full ringlets in the back.  I had no idea that my hair was curly.

My issue is not with its health or condition.  It just takes forever to dry.  This picture was taken at lunchtime, obviously not yet dry...it's a good thing that I work from home.
 
I towel dry, then put my hair in a turbie-twist for about an hour before I let it air dry.  The last time it took 13-hours to completely dry.
 
And that time is getting longer as my length increases.
 
As I said, it's absolutely virgin hair.  So I'm hesitant to introduce products that might disrupt the balance I've actually managed.
 
But there has GOT to be something that can speed up the drying time, something which doesn't cause damage.  My first thought was a hairdryer but the horror stories scared me off.
 
Help!  Suggestions?&&&My hair has never been touched by anything but water, not even shampoo, so I'm a bit nervous to introduce products.  Even common ones.&&&First drying, regular cotton bath towel.  

Second drying, a microfiber turbie-twist.  Wore it for around an hour.

Third, let the remaining moisture evaporate.  Air drying.

Today I managed to shave my time from 13 hours to less than 7, so that's progress."
Gypsy012,8avfi8,"I'm 30 yrs old and finally getting my hair right.&&&&&&My routine  (varies on if I want to try new stuff out):

1. Devacurl one condition decadence conditioner in the shower. Rinse most out, but leave some in.

2. Flip my hair over and use devacurl styling cream.
3. Use devacurl arc angel all over.
4. I use a microfiber towel to scrunch up any left over moisture and to help form curls.
5. Use clips at the crown of my head for volume and air dry.
6. I pineapple AND use a satin bonnet to sleep. 
7. Wake up and scrunch out the crunch with set it free and no touching after!

I recently got Kinky Curly knot today and Kinky Curly custard and excited to play around with it (it's glycerin free!!!) :). Any pointers would be great as my hair turns into a frizz ball mid day.&&&Thank you!"
whoisvia,8avfi8,It's lively and lovely! 
MiniDeflector,8ausfw,Do you notice a difference with the devacurl foam? I‚Äôve been thinking of trying it because I want more volume near my roots but I‚Äôm not sure. Their products are pricey and my shower is already full of other DC products üòÇ
SonorasDeathRow,8ausfw,I think it looks so good that way :)
alexandra-mordant,8ausfw,"I've had success getting more volume/something resembling curls by French braiding along my scalp when wet, and letting that dry! 


It's not really ""curls"", but it looks more consistent with the rest of my hair (curl pattern looks pretty similar to yours when it's behaving!)"
catgirl1359,8ausfw,Squish to condish will help! You can also try squishing or using praying hands to apply product instead of raking.
cupcakeluvr,8ausfw,"Maybe try sleeping with spiral rod curlers just in the very top layer?

Like [these](https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-flair-curlformers-long-and-wide/SBS-473020.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adpos=1o4&scid=scplpSBS-473020&sc_intid=SBS-473020&utm_content=SBS-473020&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnqzWBRC_ARIsABSMVTMLHgYsV0cFUfWosjpYwFubUzV0idCI4HMjJzi-WfINOHt6hoS0MwAaApzfEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).  I think they are soft and fairly comfortable for sleeping, especially if they are only on the very top layer.

I use them on my fine wavy hair (go to bed with damp hair) only on the top, and get heaps of volume that lasts all day.  Way better solution for me than re-wetting, piling on tons of product, scrunching, twisting, pinning, etc. lol."
devieous,8ausfw,"Good hair on a masque day! But need help getting curls on top&&&&&&I just got pretty intense layers from devacurl, but thanks for the suggestion :)&&&Nooooo I don‚Äôt want to believe that!&&&I have actually tried squish to condish! Do you feel you use more product this way though?&&&Yeah I don‚Äôt really diffuse very often. Maybe I should do it for like special events or if I wanna look extra cute on a certain day! I think that may be the key. I actually do have a lot of layers from my DevaCut. Thanks!&&&Yeah I do everything in the shower upside down! I also feel like leaving the towel on for longer creates more frizz, but that may just be me. &&&Thank you!&&&Routine 
1. Get hair wet

For normal routine do these and skip to 8:
2. Rake ~2 pumps DevaCurl one condition through hair
3. Finger comb 
4. Rinse out only a little bit

Special Routine (do these and 8-11)
2. Scrunch a quarter sized glob of DevaCurl Conditioning Cleanser through crown
3. Rinse out
4. Apply large glob of Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Masque throughout hair
5. Finger Comb
6. Shave or do something else while it sits in hair for like 15 mins
7. Rinse out

8. In shower, flip over hair and rake a quarter sized glob of DevaCurl Light defining gel through hair
9. Scrunch up hair
10. Apply 3 pumps of DevaCurl Frizz Free volumizing foam
11. Scrunch lightly with microfiber towel

Some days I do curl clips, but they get caught in my hair and me struggling to take them out creates frizz. I already put the foam solely in my crown, what more should I do to get curls to form on top?"
giselledelamo,8ausfw,I have the problem. My hair is pretty straight on top. I read a curly hair hairdresser in Instagram say there‚Äôs not much that can be done with that. 
joy_sea,8ausfw,"Diffusing upside down might help, but I do agree that if you have more layers then your roots won't be weighed down so much. Your hair looks really thick, so it might partially be that.

 But I also think diffusing would help too. If the problem is that they're just being weighed down by the sheervolume of hair you have. Another thought would be to maybe try a product that has more hold if what you're using doesn't. 

Good luck!"
philsfamily,8ausfw,All I could imagine would cure the flat top is some shorter layers. I cut my own hair and give myself layers to avoid flat roots :)
probablysleepingg,8ausfw,"For the top - you can try scrunching in the conditioner with your hair upside down while in the shower, and putting it under the water for a little and then taking it out and re-scrunching and repeating until you have the amount left in that you want, and then after you put in your other products - try plopping with a cotton t shirt or microfiber towel for like 20 mins or so before bed / air-drying / diffusing or whatever. You can look up a video tutorial online if you don't know what that is, but I've found it makes all the difference in whether my hair curls on top or not. 

I usually do the squish to condish in the shower, leave a little in, and then plop for about 20 mins. Then I go to bed and pineapple my hair (except without a ponytail bc I get major creases), and then when I wake up in the morning, I plop again for as long as I can like while I'm getting ready / doing my makeup and stuff. It helps a lot with the volume, especially the volume on top. "
anditdontstopcoming,8aurvq,"Finally, some definition!&&&&&&Hello!  My routine is as follows:
Wash with Eden Jojoba Monoi Moisturizing Shampoo
Condition and detangle with Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner
Style with Herbal Escences Bio:Renew Curl Defining Mouse. "
LabRatCoat,8auqub,"L‚ÄôOreal everstrong conditioner now has silicones?&&&I‚Äôm trying to switch to a low-sulfate shampoo to cut down on hair breakage (no-poo gives me horrible dandruff, can‚Äôt do it) and decided to try the L‚ÄôOreal Everstrong line because it‚Äôs low-sulfate and, according to many websites, silicone free. Except when I got home I noticed the conditioner had both dimethicone and amodimethicone, which are apparently the ‚Äúbad‚Äù silicones. What gives? What would happen if I used it anyways? "
Blk_Brbi,8atzus,Mark Anthony products! Your experiences ? Loving them so far&&&&&&Awe! Thanks üíï&&&* hair been using Curl Envy Curl Creme and Grow Long leave in conditioner for a little over a week now 
_little_red,8atzus,Perfect. Curls. Yes ma'am. 
happyhippoking,8atzus,Unrelated but you have gorgeous eyes :) and gorgeous curls too!
99999999q,8atwwx,Is this first hair day? So glorious.
AndreaCulea,8atwwx,How dare you be this beautiful!
DowntoAbbey,8atwwx,So jealous. So mad with jealously. 
Emilypooper727,8atwwx,I'm almost offended at how beautiful you are 
Janeruns,8atwwx,you‚Äôre very good looking. so is your hair.
MistressMunin,8atwwx,"You're quite striking, I must say. I love the hair, as well. Keep on rocking those magnificent curls, person."
Mynameismommy,8atwwx,Your hair is amazing. 
Nataliyaah,8atwwx,Woooow! Looks amazing
Ombra17,8atwwx,"Yesterday's curls. I think I'm really getting my routine down.&&&&&&Pretty much my normal routine with a few tweaks!

Current routine:

1. Wash hair upside with Tresemme Nourish & Replenish conditioner
2. Rinse hair with cool water
3. Turn shower off
3. While still standing in the shower with hair upside down, apply Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Boosting Mousse
4. Get out of shower and plop hair
5. Waited 20 minutes, took hair out, reapplied mousse and re-plopped hair
6. Played with the doggo for roughly 30 mins (superrrrr important step)
7. Take hair out and finish getting ready
8. Wait for hair to dry and then use microtowel to scrunch the crunch away&&&Don't think I've ever been anyone's goal. Thank you! &&&Would highly recommend. [Here's the one I use in my routine. ](http://imgur.com/IJdKKcj)
&&&I actually haven't tried gel so I can't give you an actual answer, but I will say I've never had any problems with stickiness with the mousse I use. &&&Oh I dare üòè lol thank you! &&&I like to think it is, but no one's really touching it and letting me know. I have gotten some compliments from the ladies at work about it smelling good though!&&&Thank you! &&&Aw shucks ‚ò∫ thank you&&&Well there's your problem, you're supposed to eat the whole avocado silly. 

In all seriousness though this was actually my first time using the Totally Twisted mousse. I was using their Tousling Mousse, but wanted to try this one out since it's supposed to hold a bit better. I really love how my hair came out using it, but I'm not sure if the mousse was the main reason they looked so good or if it was because this is the first time I tried plopping twice. &&&Yeah I always feel a little awkward when I tell someone where I got the routine from. I just omit the ""curly girl"" part and just say ""a curly hair method"" or something like that. &&&Thanks! &&&Thank you! I wish I had the time to get them looking like this everyday. I usually shower at the gym when I go on my lunch and then head back to work. Don't think my office would like having me wearing a towel on my head. &&&I'll have to check it out over there&&&Thank you I think? lol&&&Sure is. Thank you! &&&Thanks! Sunlight really helps it pop. &&&Thank you! &&&Vampire Red from Manic Panic! I have light brown hair already so I don't bother bleaching it. I just work the red into my hair, let it sit for about 30 mins, rinse it out, and then I'm good for around 2 months. This is how my hair looks after 2 months of having the dye so you're seeing it at a faded stage which I think I actually like better. &&&Thank you for the kind words :)

I saw that recently got a devacut. How's it treating you? &&&Thanks!&&&Don't let your dreams be dreams!&&&Thank you and thank you again :) &&&Thanks! Grew it myself lol&&&Aw! If I could share my hair I would be happy to share it. &&&Thank you and yes! I hope it helps him embrace his curls! My nephews have really curly hair that look sooooo good on them. The oldest one cut them off though because some kids were picking on him so he's never grown them back out. And of course his little brother wanted to be like him so he gets his haircut short like his older brother now. &&&Thank you internet stranger :) Wonderful comment to end my birthday with"
PinkClip_,8atwwx,"I have really thick curly hair and I love it to be full of volume and not flat. I use mousse. Anything else just weighs down my curls

cashTX,8atwwx,Hey those look like my curls before they fall/get weighed down. Do you prefer mousse over gel? I‚Äôve been interested in trying mousse but can‚Äôt stand the stickiness of some products. 
charisrose013,8atwwx,Hair goals
hashtagmollyno,8atwwx,Dude you have my dream hair. How‚Äôd you get it red?
haybalers,8atwwx,I‚Äôll be honest. I like your face almost as much as I like your hair! They both look really good :) 
imodelz,8atwwx,"seeing this makes me wish we didn't refer to everything as ""curly girl"".&&&curls are not just for girls
why do you think the penis twirls?
sorry to make your head swirl

around the world!!"
lechimeric,8atwwx,"Out of curiosity, have you tried plopping/applying mousse only once? Interested in hearing if you had different results. Definitely interested in giving your routine a try!"
msddsue_16,8atwwx,Beautiful!!!!
not4u2kn0w,8atwwx,"I‚Äôm late to the party, but you have amazing hair!!! We have similar curls (mine on a good day). I still haven‚Äôt figured out my routine yet. I tried cowashing with the Tresemme and it gave me absolutely no volume at all. I might give this mousse a go though! "
okWhateverlol,8atwwx,Is your hair as soft as it looks?
purpleandglitter,8atwwx,"How do you feel about the totally twisted curl? My hair is a lot like yours, we have very similar curls except mine tends to be frizzier and I can only get definition like this if I pray real hard, eat half an avocado on one foot and catch a falling star with my left hand. Lol! "
quickbunny01,8atwwx,I am sooooo jealous!
skippah,8atwwx,So you flip upside down to wash. Do you go right-side-up at any point before plopping? I‚Äôve never tried the upside down part before 
sweetcliches,8atwwx,"I'm totally showing my 11 year old son this! I want him to embrace the curl, and not just ""waves are fine mom!""

Also, nice face! "
sweetred69,8atwwx,You would get rave reviews on r/MajesticManes.

weeburdies,8atwwx,Wow! So SHINY! Your curls look great.
wherearethetoads,8atwwx,Woah your hair looks great!
allicat_88,8at9pt,"I do. I work out regularly but can get away with co-washing every 3-4 days. I use shampoo every few weeks, when I notice my hair start looking really dull after washing it, or when the bleached parts start looking especially yellow."
catgirl1359,8at9pt,"You just have to figure out what works for you. Totally depends on your hair. Some people cowash all the time and use shampoo maybe once a month to clarify. Other people use sulfate free shampoo 2x weekly. A lot of curlies fall somewhere in between. Just depends on what‚Äôs right for you. I personally use sulfate free shampoo once a week. I wash a second time during the week and for that I either use shampoo or cowash depending on how dirty my hair is. I have very fine, low porosity hair so products and oil build up quickly. If I don‚Äôt use shampoo regularly, I get buildup and any conditioner I use sits on my hair and won‚Äôt penetrate. "
happyhippoking,8at9pt,"Probably about once or twice a month. I think it helps to get rid of hard to remove buildup and if you have hard water, it can remove that kind of buildup from the hair too. I notice that my hair does benefit from a once a month shampoo and I get bouncier curls."
n-olie,8at9pt,"I shampoo more than most I know, 1-2x a week.  I work out almost daily and don‚Äôt like the headfeel if don‚Äôt give my scalp a good cleanse, so I usually do this after a really sweaty workout on day 2  or day 3 hair. It also makes my hair bouncier without product buildup."
notevenitalian,8at9pt,"Question about co-washing: do you EVER use shampoo?&&&I know that co-washing is a curly hair must! But I'm just curious, should I ever use shampoo? Like once a month? Once a week? What's the protocol that works best for you guys? &&&This is great advice, thank you. I've been lurking this sub for a while and I'm planning on posting a pic of my hair and my routine soon to ask for advice! I've just been really sick lately so I haven't really been doing much to my hair haha.

Thanks for the response!"
plantedtoast,8at9pt,"I don't, ever. Haven't used shampoo in at least a year. No buildup, crazy volume, and it singlehandedly got rid of my dandruff issue. 

I find that a lot of advice here is highly subjective. I'd recommend going for your longest comfortable time no shampoo, go ahead and shampoo, then decide if there's an improvement. If there's no change, go longer. If you start feeling buildup or your hair stops behaving the way you want, try shampooing. "
AtaraxiaLust,8aswtq,"Oh my goodness yes! I love your hair for one, I think we have a similar curl type! And somehow I got my hair to last until day 9 and I was SO pleased with the volume."
Myalicious,8aswtq,"Day 4 curls! Anyone else like their curls more the bigger they get? Going for 7 days&&&&&&I use OGX Coconut Curls shampoo and finish with Cantu curl activating moisturizer, once every week!&&&Nothing besides sleep on a satin pillow case &&&Lol no! Not at all... a lot of times I wake up with no pillow &&&9 days? Wow!

n-olie,8asgtd,"Your ringlets! üôå
Have you tried picking apart your bigger ringlet clumps once your hair is completely dry? This can give you more diffused hair with volume especially in shorter sections. "
gbenedetto,8ascqz,"First good hair day in a while! (Routine in comments)&&&&&&Day 1 (shower day): shower with warm water using the Deva Curl co wash system. I detangle with my fingers while the second step of the system is in. Use the style holding gel that comes with the deva curl system directly out of shower. Dry by scrunching with a microfiber towel. 
Use Curls Milkshake Styling Cream, a little dry shampoo on roots (for volume), coconut oil, and jojoba oil on hair once towel dried. Scrunch again and then leave it alone until dry.

Day 2 (nonshower day)
Reuse Curls Milkshake Styling Cream to redefine and dry shampoo and leave in conditioner for volume and to ward off knots.

I also sleep using a silk pillowcase."
