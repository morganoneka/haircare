catgirl1359,azoddv,"Most of us follow the Curly Girl/Guy Method (aka CG or CGM). It's a collection of techniques and ingredients that keep curly hair healthy. You can read more in the [Intro to CG guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/wiki/intro-cgm#wiki_the_super_short_version) to see if it's something you want to try.

You can find the cheapest (less than $12 for everything!), quickest, and most popular way to start here: https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/wiki/beginner-routine

[Here's a visual version of the beginner routine](https://i.imgur.com/FA7kPST.png)



Adding some specific recommendations on top of our automated beginner info: gel is a major help in making curls last multiple days and giving them the structure to hold their curl. Squish to condish is also great for encouraging tighter curls that'll hold better. You may find that doing S2C upside down makes the roots go in weird directions and exposes the scalp so if that happens try doing it right side up and tilting your head side to side. Feel free to ask any questions as that's a lot of new info to process!"
derpydumb,azoddv,"Thin curly hair&&&Does anyone else have thin curly hair? I specifically have female pattern alopecia, and the hair itself has normal-thick diameter. I just can‚Äôt manage it at all. The curls don‚Äôt hold but it can‚Äôt dry straight-ish for the life of me. Please tell me what products and methods can help me. I‚Äôm really at a loss because I won‚Äôt iron it since I want to minimize my hair loss. At this point the alopecia isn‚Äôt that bad, my scalp looks empty when it‚Äôs wet but that‚Äôs it. I just love my curls and I want to wear them, but after going to bed, or wearing them for a full day, they are completely lifeless at the top and like wispy at the bottom. Also to clarify, at no point is it a wearable straight. "
Longdistanceliving,azo433,"I use several Cantu products, they can easily over moisturize and/or weigh my curls down if I apply too much or use too many of them at once. 
If baby has fine/delicate hair that could be the problem. "
cheetaracupcake,azo433,"What am I doing wrong with Cantu products? It seems they made my 18 month old baby's curls relaxed or straight.&&&I had been using only Cetaphil and California Baby shampoo for her because she has sensitive skin, I started using the Cantu curling cream and it worked great! So I bought the shampoo and conditioner from the same Cantu kids line but just after ONE use, her curls almost dissapeared, maybe I didn't rinse correctly or I don't know, I changed to California Baby again and her curls are back! She has very defined curls normaly, I can fit only my pinky finger inside a curl so you can get an idea. &&&Thank you! There is a relatively new Cetaphil Baby Wash and Shampoo, it works great! 

Which brand of products for curly hair would you recommend for kids if you don't mind my asking?&&&That may be the problem then, I'll store them and use them for when she's older! Thank you for your reply!"
rosyppeachy,azo433,"Cantu products are generally really heavy so my guess is that its weighing the curls down. 

Also did you say cetaphil in the hair?? Isnt that for skin only?"
Taylortothotdish,azo3ph,"What are your favorite shampoo/conditioner brands?&&&I'm looking to expand my curly girl horizons. Since I've started, I've been dabbling with Shea Moisture, but with my hair hardly waving/curling anymore,  I'm starting to think the shea butter might be a little too much for my low/normal porosity hair. 

&#x200B;

So far from Shea Moisture I've tried their:

Low-Porosity Line (current)

Jamaican Castor Oil Protein Treatment (current)  
Fruit Fusion Coconut Water Weightless Line

 Superfruit Complex 10-in-1 Renewal System‚Äé Line

  


I've been looking into the Not Your Mother's Brand, but want some opinions and other options. I have awhile to go before I'm out of my current Shea Moisture products - but if you have anything you love, or even anything you hate, I'd love to hear about it!

magicalnest095,aznvrv,"22. My first birthday living my authentic, curly girl life.&&&&&&Thank you r/curlyhair for being such a supportive community. I started living the CG life July 2018, and with your help, haven‚Äôt looked back. It‚Äôs made me feel so much more like.. me! Truly grateful.

Routine:

-Devacurl No Poo Original

-Devacurl One Condition Original - Squish to condish!

-Devacurl Frizz-free Foam at roots
 
-Mix together Devacurl styling cream/ Light hold gel and scrunch 

-Scrunch with microfibre towel and air dry mostly upside down

-pin some unruly curls at the front for more definition 

I haven‚Äôt experimented with products much clearly, so if anyone has any alternatives close to the Devacurl line I would be very grateful to hear them!

Also if anyone has an any what curl type I actually have I am curious, I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm in the 2s or 3s

Thanks again friends :) 

Edit: sorry for the poor formatting, I‚Äôm on mobile and don‚Äôt post too often &&&Thank you so much :) I appreciate that! I left my routine as a reply to someone else if you‚Äôre interested at all.&&&Aw thank you :)&&&You‚Äôre too kind! Full disclosure I‚Äôm wearing some concealer and liquid highlighter but I have stepped up my skincare game lately!

-Palmers Cleansing Oil
-Nivea Gentle toner 
-Oxy Deep Pore pads (AM) or
-Nip+Fab Extreme Glycolic pads (PM)
**-Vichy Aqua Thermale Light cream** 
(THIS made a world of difference in the skin! Highly recommend)&&&Thank you aw! üòä&&&Thank you friend! !&&&Thank you!&&&Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes!! You‚Äôre all awesome :) &&&Thank you SO much you are so sweet! I appreciate your feedback, I was thinking something like that but it‚Äôs nice to hear from someone with similar hair :) spot on about being curlier underneath lol. Thanks again! &&&I have never tried the Supercream! I am a bit scared because I have relatively fine hair (it‚Äôs very evident if I have my hair straight) but might try to pick up a sample. Have you tried it? If so what‚Äôs your experience with it? 

Also I find the styling cream gives me slightly more definition, more moisture and less frizz than something like the Wavemaker which I used while easing into my curly journey. I try not to use too much though, or I‚Äôve found that my hair is weighed down a bit more and I loveee volume! &&&Not trans, just a girl who‚Äôs straightened and fried her hair off for as long as can be remembered üò≠ I can see where you got that though!

amj2,azmmtw,"Queer curls&&&&&&SO easy! So glad I cut it :) &&&Right back at you :) &&&I use all Lush Cosmetic products in my hair. Currently using their shampoo bars. 

I apply Lush‚Äôs ‚ÄúR&B‚Äù moisturizer directly after shower. Once hair has air dried some but still damp, I apply Lush‚Äôs ‚ÄúMr. Dandie‚Äôs Hair Candy‚Äù by first running fingers through curls, then making a fist. 

Update: wow! Thank you guys so much! Your comments were lovely to wake up to!
I give all the curl credit to Lush :)&&&I never thought I could, but I hated having long hair! It took some time, effort, and many awkward haircuts before I learn what cut worked for me.&&&Thank you for the complements! I absolutely love having my hair short.

I am using ‚Äúcopperhead‚Äù which has been discontinued. It has a bit of red henna as an ingredient. The fact they have SLS as an ingredient doesn‚Äôt bother me since my hair isn‚Äôt colored. 

What really makes a big difference is the ‚ÄúR&B‚Äù and it smells amazing.&&&Thank you! I took this picture after I was asked to come for a job interview for a position I really wanted. Found out last week I got the job :)&&&I used to work at lush too! I stocked up before they d/c it. These are actually my natural curls. When my hair was longer (shoulder length) it was wavy, not curly. 

Grow it out! If you don‚Äôt like it, you can cut it again! It‚Äôs just hair!  I would‚Äôve never known I had curly hair if I didn‚Äôt cut mine short! It was a lovely surprise. "
bstractig,azmmtw,"LOVE. Can I ask you questions? Is this your natural curl, or one you worked to achieve? I currently have a buzzcut and am thinking about growing it out. My usual hair curl is about 2a and i wanna try the cgm and see if i can get them going stronger. More curl, less ""waves"". But my main concern is being able to finger curl or scrunch my hair with gel with it being so short. I work at lush so i have total access to all the goodies (tbh sometimes i throw r&b on my hair just for the effin smell, yum). Also if you didn't know, i don't mean to break your heart but mr.dandy's hair candy was discontinued last year :( hope you have a stash to work from, otherwise i might start hunting on ebay or finding another alternative you might like"
fauxfoucault,azmmtw,"I used to have a curly pixi for years! I grew it out, and now it‚Äôs down to the small of my back. This is really tempting me to go short again. The short hair makes your features shine! The smile & eyes in particular. 

Which shampoo bar is your favorite so far? I know the Lush ones are a bit controversial because most of them have some sulfates, but I‚Äôm always intrigued. "
grammargirl8,azmmtw,Super cute! Curly pixies are so easy to maintain!
ih8comingupwithnames,azmmtw,You are rocking that pixie!  Wish i could pull it off.
pawesome-aw,azmmtw,Your smile is so radiant! And your curls are amazing c:
tworedangels,azmmtw,Love you and your hair! Great pic! I loved my short curls.
morlocky,azmj0z,"Tried a DIY mask -- so fluffy!&&&&&&Today's routine: Applied egg + honey + coconut oil to damp hair and let it sit in a shower cap for 20ish minutes. Rinsed and washed with Loreal Everclear Coconut Oil Shampoo. Then did a rinse with diluted apple cider vinegar. Plopped. Squished in some Loma Volumizing Gel. Voila.

I've been dabbling in the CG ways for a little over a year now. This is the longest my hair has been in 7 years, and I decided to grow it out and donate again! This was my first shot at a DIY mask and the ACV rinse. Just a couple things I'd found online and figured I'd give it a shot. My hair came out super soft, fluffy, and light, which surprised me because I think I'm low porosity and didn't expect egg to mix well with that. I'll definitely be incorporating this into my routine in the future.

Side note: my phone camera (LG) has an auto-photoshopping technique that I thought I turned off, but it seems to be blurring out my hair texture. Can anyone help with this?

WeAreStarless,azkei2,"i'm really curious about your belief about ""water damage"" being a thing, what has led you to believe that?"
surf-actant,azkei2,"I found this on the Holy Grail list posted in the side bar:  **L‚ÄôOreal** Boost It Blow Out Heatspray 

I think once in a while, it's not going to be that bad... I have a concert coming up next weekend, and I do intend to use my curling wand for any wayward waves. I'll definitely use a lower heat setting than I used to, when my attitude was ""damn the torpedos, FULL HEAT = BEST CURL."" 

&#x200B;"
vampyrotoothus,azkei2,"Curling wand for touch-ups?&&&Hi fellow curlies!

I‚Äôm thinking about getting a small curling wand to touch up just the top of my hair. Now before anyone jumps down my throat about heat damage, I totally believe water damage on your hair is real too and as it stands now I have to wet my hair every day to get it to look decent, and that can‚Äôt be good either! I feel like it might be better to use a low heat once in a while on my top curls to freshen them than to wet all my hair to get it to look right? I try to wet sections at a time but it just looks strange sometimes. Anyone else have this?

Does anyone have suggestions on spray products for heat protection? Preferably a spray that won‚Äôt harm the environment. I looked at the holy grail list and didn‚Äôt see much, probably because we‚Äôre generally anti-heat haha. Thanks!&&&Oh thanks! I must have missed that. And yeah, its not going to be a daily thing, I‚Äôm too lazy for that haha üòõ and definitelyyy as low heat as I can manage! "

HoneyHopScotch,azkd5u,So does the NYM conditioner help actually cleanse? I‚Äôm finding my current cowash doesn‚Äôt do much for product buildup and my hair gets gross after a week or two. Do you use something else to occasionally cleanse? My hair is really similar to yours so I‚Äôm curious

Edit: typo"
KareBexar,azka82,Are you applying the stylers to soaking wet hair or are you drying a little before applying?
aaelizaa,azka82,"I noticed you don‚Äôt list a curl cream in your current routine. Have you tried this before? I‚Äôve been experimenting with Wave Maker and B‚ÄôLeavin and both help with volume. Be‚ÄôLeavin gives me super fat, though less defined waves. Wave Maker give me a little extra volume and a LOT of definition. I think it makes my waves twirl and spiral more than usual. I apply these to wet hair right after S2C and right before applying LA Looks blue gel. If I don‚Äôt use a heavy-duty gel, the definition won‚Äôt last as long."
mimiroooo,azka82,"Everything weighs down my hair!&&&I‚Äôve been doing the CG method for about 3-4 months and I‚Äôve been genuinely happy with my hair only two days out of that timespan. I‚Äôve got normal porosity wavy hair, cut in a recent Deva cut. Only part of my hair will behave at a given time - it‚Äôs either not enough volume or my wavy hair turns straightish when it dries. 

I‚Äôve experimented with lots of products, and right now my routine is this - wash every other day with  DevaCurl‚Äôs Low-Poo Delight shampoo, followed by Innersense Pure Inspiration Daily Conditioner (I was using DevaCurl‚Äôs Delight conditioner, but my stylist recommended I switch to something lighter). I rinse that out completely, then scrunch in DevaCurl‚Äôs Ultra Defining Gel immediately after showering, I‚Äôll plop my hair in a T-shirt for 15-30 minutes, then diffuse or air dry depending on how much time I have. 

I have to shower in the morning, because if I sleep on my wet hair it looks like a disaster (I‚Äôve tried sleeping with it plopped in a T-shirt and it will inevitably fall out, and refreshing with a spray bottle the next day does nothing). I‚Äôve tried leave-ins, I‚Äôve tried using only shampoo, and my hair is just okay at best. I‚Äôm feeling really discouraged and I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong. &&&I flip my head upside down to scrunch in gel. Normally I just go straight to the scrunching motion, but I guess I can lather it in with praying hands, if I‚Äôm understanding correctly? (There‚Äôs a lot of new terminology in this group and I get a little frazzled sometimes hahah).

I definitely struggle with getting all the conditioner out of my hair - I‚Äôve got really thick hair so it can hide easily! I‚Äôve noticed a difference since my stylist called me out on how gunky my hair felt haha&&&Soaking, as my stylist recommended!&&&I used the Wave Maker for a while and loved it! I should definitely get back into it, just have been lazy about buying it again. "
namastayouttautah,azka82,"Do you do the praying hands thing? I finally bought the book and wavies/s'wavies are supposed to scrunch in the gel from the bottom as to not weigh the curl down. Also, rinse out conditioner and focus it away from the roots. All of this was news to me after learning everything I knew from groups like this."
