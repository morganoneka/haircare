headoverheels14,hu40v5,Is that a ringlet that I see?!&&&
VintageWitchcraft,hu3x4v,"I live for the Shea Moisture products. I really like their: 100% coconut oil leave-in treatment, Manuka honey hydration shampoo, (if really dry) raw shea butter moisture retention conditioner, and the coconut & hibiscus conditioner.

All of these products have proteins in them. I believe my hair is medium to high porosity and I haven't had protein overload problems so I think this is working well.

Lately I've been downright abusing the leave-in treatment, I spray a lot in my hair every single day after my shower. The leave-in helps my curls/waves detangle, clump together, and it offers a slight hold if I skip the gel and not touch my hair after scrunching as it dries."
ash0427,hu3x4v,Favorite CVS/drugstore products with protein?&&&&&&I was looking into the Cantu products! Do you think it might be too heavy for waves or no?

PlainISeeYou,hu3m9i,Very Nice!
livelaughrun--eh,hu3m9i,"Your pattern looks way similar to mine, whats your texture? and What products did you use?"
syd_ann96,hu3m9i,"Reminiscing a good hair day when I actually put in effort...&&&&&&My hair is very fine, but I have a lot of it with 2a/2b waves. This was after using the Shea moisture African black soap shampoo and the NYM naturals pink conditioner. Squish to condish, wash out most of the conditioner and apply LA looks gel using the praying hands/scrunching method on soaking wet hair. Microplop with t-shirt and reverse plop with a microfiber hair towel. I never put my hair upside down because I will lose definition close to my roots!"
LittleBit20,htqdnr,"I love the balayage! I've been wanting to get it done on my hair for some time now, but I always chicken out lol. You're 2a waves appear to be very much like mine! I have a lot of straighter bits on the back of my head, but I get a similar wave pattern to yours on the front and sides. Its awesome to see other 2a wavies out there!"
PlainISeeYou,htqdnr,"Same, girl! Everyone talks about our past history of heat styling to get it straight, but how many of us used to use curlers and wavers to try to get what we have naturally lol üôà"
coralto,htqdnr,What is KCCC?
rainbowjanebo,htqdnr,"Best hair day since starting the new wavy routine for my 2A waves! Can't believe I used to destroy it with heat trying to get it to look like this.&&&&&&It's such a wild perspective shift! üòÇ&&&Thank you! It's an almost grown-out balayage. I'll miss it when it's all gone. üò≠

And that's how mine is on most days too! Irregular with some flat pieces. I think the mask helped.. My two most bouncy wave days have been on mask day!

For the KCCC I did an open-palm scrunch while it was still sopping wet and in clumps in the shower. No prayer hands this time. Then plopped in a t-shirt immediately for about 20 min. Scrunched in a little more KCCC after taking it down and then air dried.&&&Today's routine:

-Shampoo with NYM Gardenia and Mango shampoo (pink bottle)

-Love Beauty and Planet rose mask (not CGM approved due to some oils but my hair loves it)

-S2C NYM Gardenia and Mango conditioner, rinse

-S2C SheaMoisture Hemp leave-in spray conditioner

-Plop with KCCC, SOTC&&&Thanks so much! I recently chickened out of getting it touched up. I originally got it done before I tried out the wavy method, so I've been wondering how my waves will fare if I get it redone eventually. If you ever do it, you'll have to let the sub know how it goes. üòÅ

I'm glad I'm not alone in having a mix of 2A and straighter bits! The front pieces on either side of my face actually love to stay straight, so I'm envious that your 2A locks show in the front! üòÇ"
soupnoudles,htqdnr,"love the loose waves and the colour gradient of your hair! i feel like this is my hair's potential but it's all irregular waves where some are sprongy and others just stubbornly lie flat. quick question, how did you plop with KCCC -- just apply with prayer hands and then plop?"
BlackWhiteStriped,htm72n,When someone tells me to just brush out my waves&&&
LIFOMakesJesusCry,htm72n,"I feel like wave direction/style can make a big difference too.  My natural hair is between 1c and 2a, and if I try to brush out my dry hair after the waves have set it looks like that.  Sometimes I do overnight curls with a headband and brushing it out gives it a nice, Hollywood wave effect.  But those curls/waves are all in the same direction, whereas my natural hair waves in different directions and looks very chaotic if I brush."
ma_hell_yeah,htm72n,"I have wavy hair and I can brush it with a boar bristle brush to have big soft waves. I do have a shag haircut though, so I have less hair at the bottom and don‚Äôt have to worry about triangle effect. Sometimes I brush my hair out on day three or four when my hair is getting tangly and it helps redistribute oil and lets me get more days between washes. When I first brush it, I look really weird but then I smooth it back down with a little leave in conditioner and I have shiny soft waves."
yumbrainsss,htm72n,"I was thinking about getting a shag! Does this make your waves more manageable? / would you mind sharing a pic?&&&I LOVE IT. Thank you for sharing, I will definitely mention this to my stylist when my appointment finally comes around."
BlackWhiteStriped,htjuoz,"briogeo scalp revival charcoal! It is a bit pricey but I swear it works. I've used head and shoulders for years but using it was as useful as using a hand dryer to put out a grease fire. My sister bought this for me for my birthday and because she said my dandruff made a snowstorm everytime I turned my head. You apply it to the places where you typically feel the dandruff is, and deeply massage it in your scalp. It smells very minty and you will feel a tingle in your scalp, even when you rinse it out. This miraculous gray gunk really solved my dandruff without affecting my waves too much"
Mantkoso,htjuoz,"A lot of dandruff in wavy hair ! Help me!&&&&#x200B;

I'm growing my wavy hair out using curly approved products, and I've always suffered from dandruff. I used to use shampoo with Ketoconazole and it controlled it, but I know that using this type of shampoo now is very strong and could damage my hair.

The dandruff is like in the pictures, the itching is mild but it comes at times, now you recommend me to take that anti-dandruff shampoo again or you know of a different treatment that I can follow, since it makes me very uncomfortable to see the dandruff in all my hair and part of my clothes"
MynameisntLinda,htjuoz,What do you suggest instead?
Shallane,htjuoz,"As I Am has a line that is curly approved for dry and itchy scalps that contains zinc pyrithione. I've really liked their cowash since it has tee tree oil and mint in it as well to give a really nice cooling and tingly feeling on your scalp  I still find that I occasionally need my ketoconazole shampoo, but I just treat it as clarifying and use a deep conditioner on those wash days."
SpaceyKiKi,htjuoz,"Jason‚Äôs tea tree shampoo, you can add zinc to it to help with dandruff"
miamcb16,htjuoz,"If you plop, stop doing that. The warm and wet atmosphere is the perfect place for fungi and bacteria (i.e. dandruff) to grow. Hope this helps"
lavacaakess,ht9pz1,I‚Äôm jealous! Your hair looks amazing
lilsn00zy,ht9pz1,2 weeks into the Curly Girl Method. Shampoing with Hair Food every 7 days. A co-wash with Cantu co-was every 2-3 days. No brushes or combs Styling with Cantu Wave Mouse. Or Cantu curl activator&&&
WeAreStarless,ht8dbf,"your conditioner isn't silicone free. silicones create a plastic-y layer around your hair shaft that prevents moisture from coming in, and can create waxy build-up. you need to clarify, and then switch to products that are both sulfate _and_ silicone free"
deets23_,ht8dbf,"Want to start CGM but can‚Äôt tell if hair needs moisture due to broken baby hairs and snap test, or if needs protein due to stringy greasy/waxy hair at back/under layer of hair even though I don‚Äôt use any hair products except for sulfate free shampoo/conditioner :/ help!&&&&&&Omg it makes sense that my conditioner was the problem.

Sylvss1011,ht7fdw,Using curl cream and mousse vs swimming in chlorinated pool&&&
mrachelle326,ht7fdw,My hair looks amazing after chlorine. It's so unfair that chlorine and salt water are awful for your hair.
Pixelline,ht2hq9,Me too! The only issue i get is greasy roots no matter what shampoo I use already on day 2 and I use dry shampoo and it looks great. Your hair looks amazing!

PlainISeeYou,ht09ri,"1. There is no product on this planet that will give you waves that aren‚Äôt there naturally, so it doesn‚Äôt matter how much coaxing it requires- if you can get waves to form, your hair is ‚Äúactually‚Äù wavy lol 

2. It‚Äôs been a week, girl. Give it time."
awkwardauntenergy,ht09ri,"Help!&&&I‚Äôm new to the whole wavy hair thing. I had wavy hair up until I was about 4 y/o, and recently learned I could get my curls back with the CGM. I‚Äôve been doing this for about a week and the very front of my hair is easily a 2b/2c curl but the back and sides need a lot of coaxing to get to a 2a with a few 2b/2c curls and a few straight pieces. Is my hair just not actually wavy? I know people can have different curl patterns, but is there anything I can do to get tighter/more consistent waves in the back? 

I don‚Äôt have a consistent routine but I started with a clarifying shampoo and been washing every other day with Maui moisture shampoo and a coconut oil conditioner, brushing the conditioner through and scrunching right out of the shower, adding gel or mouse, and then scrunching with a tshirt, plopping for 10 mins to an hour and then either diffusing or air drying.

I have fine hair but I‚Äôm not sure about the porosity.&&&Thanks! maybe I just need some patience :) Also, do you wrap your hair when you sleep with the braids, or not?"
gloooooooo,ht09ri,"I would just stick to the routine you have and give it time :) not only are you reconditioning all your old hair that is on your head now, but your new hair will be treated better as it grows and wont get so dry and damaged in the first place. I see before and after posts for the cgm like a year apart sometimes and you will continue to see improvements like that too beyond what you notice in the first few weeks. I also like to sleep in rope braids to help my flatter sections of hair sometimes too if your normal wave pattern isnt tightening"
professionalhippo1,ht09ri,Try just finger detangling! The brushing could be why some of the parts are straight.
a_diddle,hsvn8u,"First good hair day in weeks!&&&&&&New to reddit so I don‚Äôt know to put text in the post but I have a really hard time getting my hair to wave. I tried some new products last night and I‚Äôm pretty impressed. We‚Äôll see if the curls stay once my hair dries üòÖ

Products used:

Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothing: put it on my hair dry before I got in the shower and let it sit for about 5-10 mins 

Kristen Ess Signature Shampoo/Conditioner (not sure if this is cgm approved but it said ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù so I was intrigued) 

NYM Curl defining cream&&&Update my hair is dry and my curls stayed! Feeling so successful!"
pochierteziege,hsrypv,Is anyone here from Switzerland and can reccomend me Products That i can buy here?&&&I have shoulderlenghth Wavy hair and Curly hair at the Ends :)
megannza,hrzmqr,"Curls Blueberry Bliss leave in Conditioner or Hair Milk&&&Does anyone have experience with both of those products? The curls website says the leave-in conditioner is better for all hair textures, while hair milk is for 3-4 curls."
Lucymoby,hry1oa,It looks like you have more 2c 3a hair rather than 2b. I can't help with the workout thing because I have the same problem and have yet to find a solution.
didusayday6,hry1oa,"hi! it looks like we have similar hair types. i try to keep my routine as minimal as possible as well. currently I am using a curl cream from zotos all about curls line and a flaxseed and aloe vera gel from ecoslay called orange marmalade. i use both of these products on wet hair and i do not rake either of them in. i just use the prayer hands method. i workout also, and what i usually do is put my hair in a very high pony, do a bun, and use a headband. hopefully your hair isn‚Äôt too short for what i suggested... but i hope this all works!"
mistyann4,hry1oa,"I would recommend firstly not brushing it when it‚Äôs dry, it‚Äôll easily make it frizzy like you said. Try combing it in the shower or brushing it right before you jump in the shower. 
I‚Äôve recently found Not Your Mothers brand shampoo and conditioner in Natural Curls Tahitian Gardenia set and love it. 
Can you apply your oil when your hair is pretty damp? Also you could try when you get out of the shower, use a hair towel (deva curl makes a fab one!) or cotton T-shirt to lightly take off the dripping ends or plopping  then apply oil, or apply oil then plop. Good luck!"
mrshoffu,hry1oa,"Hello! I would guess your hair is curlier than you think, I would encourage you to check out the curly hair subreddit and try silicone and sulfate free products, no brushing, squishing to consist, etc.  they have a great getting started doc.  Good luck!"
nan00shie,hry1oa,"Try using a leave in conditioner after washing your hair its life changing!! If you wanted to take it a step further u can use gel too. Also, you don't necessarily have to put in a lot of products when you refresh your hair just a bit of water is fine (a bit of leave in conditioner or gel is good if u really wanted to put something in)."
rileyisflying,hry1oa,"Please help with minimal 2b routine!&&&I have only recently discovered that I have 2b hair and I don't really know how to take care of it. I'm looking for some advice on what products might help me. I would prefer a minimal routine because if it becomes too much, I'll have trouble keeping up with the several steps. 

I prefer washing my hair only twice a week and these are the products that I use:

* Tresemme Salon Silk shampoo
* Tresemme Salon Silk conditioner (I don't apply it to the roots)
* The Body Shop's argan oil spray (I spray it onto my palms and then apply to my hair also with the exception of my roots because I don't want it to look greasy)

My hair only looks like it does in the pics on my wash days after air drying. I very rarely use heat. After it's dry, I brush it out and it gets a bit poofy and frizzy but the argan oil kinda helped but just a tiny bit, the difference isn't really noticeable. That's why I started using the argan oil spray thinking it would help with that. On the days that I workout, after my hair is dry (from all the sweat)  it starts feeling very dry, stiff, poofy, and loses its shape. I don't want to not brush my hair but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to refresh it (without using any dry shampoo. I've never used it anyway).
