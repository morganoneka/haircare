DixieGoblin,kcp5yr,"I love Courtney! S2C definitely helps. 

I would check on the ingredients in the Bumble and Bumble products you‚Äôre using. Many of them are CG. You may have build up or be using drying alcohols."
ShinigamiLeaf,kcp5yr,"You'd hair is seriously looking better after just a couple months! Heads up though that keeping it healthy while also bleaching is HARD. I love dying my hair but gave up and went to using only henna dyes this year cause my hair was just too destroyed. A good cut will help, and a lot of repairing treatments, but I honestly don't know if getting it fully healthy is possible while bleaching. Even with all that though I'd say your hair is looking better"
hungry_ghost34,kcp5yr,"Am I right in thinking your hair has been bleached?  If so, an Olaplex 3 treatment will probably help."
hurray4dolphins,kcp5yr,"It is so hard for some of us waives to coax the wave into our hair!

I bet if you cut off more hair you could coax more curls or waves. Or if your stylist cut a lot of the weight out of your hair. or add layers. 

 I, personally, have not been staying strictly CGM and it has been fine for my hair. Some of my fav products aren‚Äôt CGM approved. Some of the methods I have learned here have been really helpful, though. Using squish to condish to apply LA looks gel to my sopping wet hair was a game changer. So was plopping, pixi diffusing, and using a hair buff to help keep my waves volumized and in tact. These methods have all been more important in my journey then actually staying cgm approved is.

So, if you haven‚Äôt tried some different methods then maybe try experimenting more with that?"
justHopps,kcp5yr,"You will need a haircut. some layers will do a lot of good. Seriously ask for layers. A stronger hold product will help as well. 

Make sure to read up on moisture and protein balance. Sometimes a boost of protein helps. 

Two months is not a lot of time. I like to clarify my hair every few weeks especially if you‚Äôre not using CGM approved products."
kansas_hooper,kcp5yr,"I‚Äôm almost two months in and I see 0 change. I have a hair cut scheduled at the end of January where I plan to chop 3-4‚Äù off. Should I just baby my waves till then?&&&&&&I‚Äôve got an appt with my girl scheduled for the end of January. It was the soonest I could get in with her cause her Saturdays go super fast. I plan on chopping 3-4‚Äù off plus getting tons of layers.&&&Current routine: 
Shampoo: Bumble and Bumble BB Curl Moisturizing shampoo. Scrub roots/scalp and let it rinse down my length. 

Conditioner: Bumble and Bumble 3-in-1 conditioner. I usually apply this to dripping hair, finger rake it thru, then detangle with a wet brush. With my last wash I tried to S2C like Swavy Curly Courtney does. 

Then I apply Paul Mitchell Flexible Styling Foam with prayer hands first. Then scrunch it in. 
I try to avoid heat so if I don‚Äôt have time to air dry I‚Äôll diffuse on cold by pixie diffusing (I think this is what I‚Äôm doing?). 
I usually sleep in a satin scarf unless it‚Äôs close to wash day. 

My hair is a stringy and tangled mess usually even after I wash and dry. What am I doing wrong?! Add a curl cream? Too much moisture? Not enough? I‚Äôm so new still I know and I need to figure my hair out but I feel very very lost.&&&Yep it has been to achieve the vibrancy I want. Thankfully my stylist is certified to use Olaplex during colors so that‚Äôs always done along with bleach and color. I have been doing the No. 3 treatments semi-regularly at home but I need the largest bottle for all this hair and that shits not cheap.&&&I‚Äôm switching conditioners to the SheaMoisture Curl and Shine this week after learning (literally today) Bumble and Bumble isnt CGM approved. I feel bad switching brands before I run out of the product. Just ran out of the BB conditioner so a trip to Ulta is in order."
Andromeda853,kcoswc,"I second the protein treatment, and also experiment with other conditioners! I use NYM shampoos and a mix of two conditioners, one of which is actually a frizz/climate control one (still cgm i think) that i mix in to a second shampoo. Thats helped tame my hair a bit."
DrBubblesPhD,kcoswc,"I have heard deva curl is in some hot water for wrecking people's hair. I would be wary of that. As far as good, lightweight moisture that doesn't weigh hair down, I swear by the Not Your Mother's Naturals Coconut Milk and Marula Tree Oil shampoo and conditioner. I have tried others but keep coming back to it."
Encodead,kcoswc,"First off I'm very jealous of the volume of your hair! It's lovely. I wanted to weigh in and say you'd probably benefit from not just a clarifying shampoo session, but a chelating one too just in case you've got any kind of mineral build up (particularly if you've got colour treated hair which can leave residue as well.) I do a clarifying and chelating shampoo once every few weeks because our water is SO hard where I live. But if you don't have hard water, just try a one off chelating treatment (I think you can get sachets from Sally's). It helps to remove stuff a normal clarifying shampoo can't. All sorts of things can affect hair - water quality, mineral residues, pollution, medications, health etc and chelating can help with the residue that some of those things leave behind.

It sounds like you may have hydral fatigue due to over moisturising, but it's hard to know for sure without seeing your hair up close...either way I'd definitely work on getting the right protein / moisture balance. If you haven't already, it really helps to look up signs of hydral fatigue and protein overload so you can distinguish the signs if your hair starts going in the wrong direction. For example my hair really loves protein, my waves always bounce back after I've done a protein treatment.

I can't recommend products as I've not found my holy grails either, but experiment with some cheap options first - you need to find what works for you as some people's hair doesn't react well to certain ingredients - Glycerin, coconut, Shea, etc. All that type of stuff comes in to play, especially when it comes to wavies as traditional curly products can weigh our waves down. And don't be afraid to stray away from the ""traditional"" techniques, it's all about finding what works for your hair! 

On the plus side you can always give products to your partner if they don't work for you :) 

Ps as someone else has said, I'd hold off on Deva curl for a while if your hair has reacted badly. They've been under question for some time with some people having hair issues that are possibly attributed to their products."
HotRice0,kcoswc,"Wavy hair help!&&&&&&Hi! I am trying to figure out my hair and have been having a lot of trouble! I have wavy hair and have tried a lot of products my boyfriend uses for his curly hair that always weigh mine down ( Shea moisture and Deva Curl) and I am currently using just OGX brand for shampoo and conditioner and I know it‚Äôs not good for my hair but I am frustrated of buying things that don‚Äôt work. 

My hair is also SO dry and I feel like this has happened in the last couple weeks. Whenever I get it wet it becomes so tangly whereas before it would be super silky and I could comb thru with my fingers no problem, now I have to spend a while trying to get the tangles out in the shower. I used an entire Deva Curl Matcha moisture mask in the past 2 weeks and it didn‚Äôt help. 

I don‚Äôt know what products to use that won‚Äôt weigh down my hair and bring out my natural waves and restore moisture. I have looked on a bunch of sites and sources to try an find what would be best for wavy but it all seems like it would suit curly better and I would love anyone‚Äôs suggestions!! Thank you!!&&&Thank you all so much for your suggestions! I have read all the comments thoroughly and taken many notes and am excited to try some new things out!"
LSDsavedmylife,kcoswc,"Honestly I found simplifying my routine has helped a lot. A lot of the products used by many curlies like sheamoisture are meant for people with very curly hair and kinky textures, so it weighs down waves. Ive found that if you‚Äôre wavy you probably want to stay away from lots of heavy oils like coconut oil, and heavy protein.

I recently bought Johnson & Johnson baby shampoo for curly hair (~$4) which I really like. It comes in a pink bottle and you can find it at pretty much any drug store in the US. It lathers and cleans well. It was recommended on one of the Holy Grail threads here.  

For conditioner I splurged a bit on Giovanni smooth as silk. It is really good, but next I will probably buy the matching J&J conditioner to my shampoo because it‚Äôs cheaper.  

The reason I‚Äôll probably drop the Giovanni is because I‚Äôve been using the papaya Garnier Fructics Hair Food 1 min mask as needed and it helps a lot. It smells so yummy too!  

Also for leave in I have Curls blueberry or Kinky Curly. Both are great and don‚Äôt weigh the hair down. (there is coconut oil in the curls blueberry but it doesn‚Äôt bother me)"
Mybishop,kcoswc,"Hey girl, not sure if this will help. I have super dry wavy hair and use Olaplex no 6 and 7. (Not CGM friendly) but it makes all the difference and you need the TINIEST bit of both, I focus on only my ends. I‚Äôll usually layer a mousse or gel on top (any will be fine) and this will cut down massively on frizz. I know they‚Äôre pricey but I suspect a bottle of each will last me at least two years. Good luck üíô."
Retiredgiverofboners,kcoswc,Your hair is beautiful.  If it feels like straw it might be because of too much protein.  Maybe clarify and do a moisture mask?  Or stop shampooing and just cowash (I love as I am cowash)
TheKakistocracy,kcoswc,"Do you have access to the [Garnier hair food](https://www.prettylittlething.com.au/garnier-ultimate-blends-hair-food-banana-3-in-1-dry-hair-mask.html) in your country? I have wavy hair that can get very dry and straw-like and have had similar problems detangling in the shower - this stuff has absolutely saved me for that! I use the banana one the most as I find the macadamia one to be a bit too heavy and the Aloe Vera is not as conditioning for my hair. It‚Äôs not always even expensive - I usually buy it when it‚Äôs on special at my local supermarket for $5.99 AUD. Love this stuff so much, it could definitely be worth a try for that shower part!

Edit: I‚Äôve not used Deva Curl before but I do sometimes use Shea Moisture curl & shine shampoo and conditioner and also find that a lot of the time it leaves me quite greasy. I prefer to use a less specialised sulphate-free shampoo (Glow Lab at the moment) and then just soak my hair in Garnier‚Äôs hair food. :P"
TweedleJAR,kcoswc,"Adding to this, using Olaplex #0 & #3 always helps with damage & makes my hair feel amazing! Really the entire Olaplex line could help!"
Wavesmith,kcoswc,Seconding what somebody else said that if your hair feels tangly when wet you may be using products with too much protein for your hair. I‚Äôd look to make some if your products protein free.
coastalsagebrush,kcoswc,"Someone suggested that I use a foam for my hair cuz creams always just weigh down my hair and I've def seen an improvement. It was always really dry and kinda greasy at the same time but the foam adds great definition, keeps my hair hydrated, and doesn't weight it down"
jbei9981,kcoswc,"It sounds like your struggling with protein/moisture balance. Tough to say about which it is, but manes by Mel on YouTube has a great video on this and I think it would help you. 

In terms of products - My hair is a bit curlier than yours, but I can definitely relate to the super dry, tangly as soon as it's wet feeling. The best products I have found have been Not Your Mother's naturals, and the curl talk products. I've found that my hair gets very straw like if I use too many products with protein in them (which I think all of the curl talk products do), so I like to combine the curl talk (protein rich) shampoo with very moisturizing conditioner. The one I've found has surpassed all others is the NYM naturals tahitian gardenia (pink) conditioner and curl defining combing cream. When my hair is feeling super tangly and rough when it's wet, these immediately make it feel soft.

 The other trick that might help with the tangles is to really work in a lot of water with your conditioner, to the point where it feels slippery like seaweed. This is what will truly moisturize your hair. I think it matters less how ""heavy"" the products are if you use them sparingly and dilute them by using on very wet hair."
neverseektotell,kcoswc,"I would start with cowashing - look for the cheapest curly girl friendly conditioners where you are and only shampoo once every 3 washes. 

Then I would look for ways to work the water into your hair when you wash - squishing or the bowl method. 

Then I would try finding ways to seal in the water with products - whether that‚Äôs using a few drops of almond oil on your hands and scrunching, or using a leave-in conditioner or gel on wet hair.

But honestly, I‚Äôve gotta say I love how your hair looks in the second pic."
pissgender,kcoswc,I think you might be overmoisturized! its weird but if your hair is overmoisturized it can sometimes feel dry and tangly. try doing a protein treatment!
potatopotatoee,kcoswc,"My hair is really similar to yours, I think. I'm taking a break from buying styling products for the same reason ¬†‚Äì they're so hit or miss for my fine wavy hair, and the costs add up.

I've been experimenting with hair treatments that use ingredients I already have (inspired by  this post on [curly hair recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ay4gup/easy_diy_recipes_for_homemade_curly_girl_products/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).) Was skeptical, but so far it's been way more reliable than products. 

I'm still using Hask shampoo + conditioner (avoiding sulfates, which dry my hair out), ending with a cold water rinse. Then I leave in some conditioner and apply homemade flaxseed gel, squishing out as much water as possible, so my hair isn't weighed down. It makes my hair look really healthy/shiny when I SOTC on my dry hair. 

Also been doing a deep condition treatment once a week with warm honey (humectant that hydrates hair) followed by coconut oil (seals cuticle) on warm, damp hair, which made my hair silkier. For fine hair, you just have to rinse it out well, even with a small bit of shampoo to avoid oily vibes. Good luck!"
txdejavu,kcoswc,Hiiii! I'm still learning what works best for me too but a tip im learned maybe it will help... Start with the basic products that are cheap. .... Youd be surprised at how many of the cheaper products meet the CG method. For instance.. Right now for deep clean shampoo I use Suave Clarity.. Condition with V05 extra body with collagen ... Leave in conditioner As I Am ... Do not rinse the leave in...Squish to condition so that your hair is saturated... I use a hair genie towel to plop and squeeze out extra water ...it can way your waves down..i section my hair ... I use a dime size amt of Cantu curl activating cream... Then I go over the cream using La Looks Gel... Coat every section... Lastly i Use Herbal Essence volume mousse... A little air dry and then diffuse upside down. And then scrunch out the crunch.... Like i said I'm still learning but a major thing ive figure out that makes a difference is your technique to apply products.... im still learning but ive seen a major increase in my volume and curls pattern. If you want to message me id me more than happy to share some progress pics :) Hang in there you can figure it out but I get the frustration :)
vhrthrt,kcoswc,"I believe some Ogx products have silicones which can sometimes cause dryness and buildup. You could try a silicone free routine as well as a clarifying shampoo like others mentioned. You could have hard water like I do, so I switched to Ion Hard Water Shampoo (from Sally‚Äôs) and it has definitely helped make my hair more soft and less dry! I also use Shea Moisture Manuka Honey Repair Protein Treatment once in a while and that helps as well as I was lacking protein!"
Bonitanina,kcjcnt,I have enjoyed finger curling it gives more definition but you need to follow the direction of your natural curls and a few occasionally the opposite direction but it will still be straight at the roots most likely. Mine is anyway I just recommend diffusing the roots for lift!
Wavyhaircare,kcjcnt,"Getting my waves to start higher requires a combo of techniques:

Styling upside down and applying product upside down.

Plopping to keep my roots from going flat due to the weight of water.

Damp styling instead of wet styling (meaning applying my products after plopping)

Diffusing dry instead of air drying 

Microplopping at any step if I see water pulling my roots flat. 

For me it's almost all about fighting water from pulling my hair down higher up. Though part of it is also making sure I get mousse all the way up my strands."
lewan115,kcjcnt,"Waves on top of head?&&&Hello all! I have some trouble with the crown of my head with my waves. I have about 2b waves and it looks great until about 3/4 up my hair and it looks kinda straight.

I was thinking about finger coiling but I'm not sure how that works on wavy hair. Anyone have some advice for this? Thanks!&&&This is really helpful!! I find though that plopping sometimes makes my roots flat (though maybe that's because I apply my products before plopping). What do you do to microplop?&&&Haha I love the positivity!

Numky101,kciwpp,"When you wash your hair upside down..&&&Do you have to untangle with a comb or brush?

TraumaMamaZ,kciwpp,Same here...
helldog89,kciwpp,"Swavycurlycourtney has a good tutorial on Instagram and YouTube on how to wash and brush upside down, to avoid tangles when you flip it the right way up - essentially you have to pull the hair away from the scalp when brushing or finger detangling so it isn't stuck to the scalp and moves freely. It's taken me ages to get the hang of it and still don't always get it right when I'm in a rush!"
thenavylark,kciwpp,"I use a wet brush, but I also use my fingers to detangle. If my hair is dry I do lose some definition, but I can recapture some if I add water (or gel/mousse depending on the weather) and open palm ""scrunch"" (so kind of like a pat? Idk. I dont close my hand into a fist)."

I probably will buy it eventually but I think I will try a rice treatment for now!"
snarktini,kci86q,"I love it, but it's worth noting that it's both a protein AND a moisture treatment. My hair is dry and while I benefit from protein I can only use a little and only it if it's paired with a ton of hydration and Repair Me works great that way for me. So I tend to think it won't have enough protein for someone who's over-moisturized, but that's just a guess on my part. What about a rice treatment (which was waaaay too much for my hair) or some protein-heavy stylers? Might be cheaper and easier to access. I have also had great luck adding Neutral Protein Filler to existing products -- in the hand, not in the bottle -- to avoid buying all new ones.

2BC, fine, extremely dense, low porosity"
zillarillazilla,kci86q,"I am on a similar quest! 

Here is what I have found so far:

1) Hask Keratin Protein Treatment (pink packets for $2-3 at Target or Ulta) - I loved this and it‚Äôs definitely been my favorite so far. Smelled good, worked really well, affordable.

2) Curls Blueberry Bliss Treatment (at Target) - not digging it as much as Hask. It‚Äôs getting the job done though, and I‚Äôm finishing the bottle.


3) Ecoslay Matcha Boost (on ecoslay website) - haven‚Äôt tried yet but I‚Äôm excited to use it after I‚Äôm done with blueberry bliss is done. The ingredient list is very similar to Curl Repair."
MaltyMiso,kchlvb,Why would you want to use silicones is my first question? I use them because my hair high porosity from bleaching and cannot hold moisture very well. Silicones don't really absorb on anyone either. I would say if your hair is dry at all it might give your hair an even harder time absorbing moisture but you can also experiment and see what works for you.

anonymous_here767,kcfwa4,"Two good wash days in a row!!!&&&&&&I've had two good wash days in a row! This is completely unheard of for me, and I think I figured out how to use diffusing to help my hair. The gray sweater is today after SOTC, the blue shirt is Wednesday right after SOTC (it lost a lot of volume and definition a few minutes later)

Routine:

Shampoo with As I am Dry and Itchy Scalp (Wed.) or Love, Beauty, and Planet prevent and preserve (today, my hair didn't feel like it needed the extra moisture from As I am) I use warm/hot water to shampoo and try to rub with my fingers all over my scalp. I turn my head all over to get the water and shampoo where it needs to be.

Condition: NYM Naturals Green Apple conditioner: used one-two pumps squished/detangled, let sit through rest of shower, then rinsed out while scrunching with cold water on lower pressure. Rinsed side-to-side and sometimes upside down

Gel: Giovanni LA Naturals: Kinda roped and kinda prayer hands (application is not my strength) all over. Sometimes upside down. **Added more water by cupping it in when I felt like I needed to.** I think this helped somewhat with application and frizz reduction, which I've been struggling with as the seasons changed.

Finally, I plopped while I got dressed etc. (10 minutes max. probably.) Then, I let my hair air dry for awhile (until it was more dampish, this was totally random on Wednesday, but tested it again today to see if it would work). Then, I diffused for about 10 minutes. It still had to air dry for a few hours, but I think diffusing helped with definition.

I know the routine looks super long, but it's honestly really simple."
TraumaMamaZ,kccsmn,"I usually use some Bobby pins to keep it off my face.

I‚Äôve heard on r/curlygirl that the conditioner is heavier on moisture than protein. But the shampoo lists soy protein relatively high on the ingredient list, so I‚Äôm curious about that product. They also have a curl cream, which I know nothing about! Any feedback is appreciated. Has anyone tried it? What did you think, and what is your hair like?&&&Update if anyone sees this post later: I love the shampoo in this line. It‚Äôs very sudsy, and makes my hair feel squeaky clean, but it‚Äôs still CG approved. If you feel like you get your best results after a reset wash, I 100% recommend this shampoo. It gives the same feeling but isn‚Äôt as harsh as a sulfate. Plus, my hair is loving the dose of protein. Curls clump easier and more consistently. 

I‚Äôve not tried the conditioner or curl cream but honestly I might after such good results with the shampoo. Price point is similar to NYM"
StrawberryHead99,kc55sy,"Product help!&&&I don‚Äôt even know where to begin! I think I have 2a/2b hair type. I have really thick hair that is low/medium porosity. It gets frizzy too. When trying to figure out a good CGM for my boyfriend (who has really curly hair) I dabbled in some of the products and found that they weight my hair down A LOT. Now I‚Äôm overwhelmed and at a loss of what to use for my hair. I don‚Äôt know what masks or even gel/mousse to use. I‚Äôve spent quite some time on this subreddit but I find it so overwhelming I‚Äôm not quite sure where to start. 

I currently use Maui lightweight/hydration + hibiscus water for condition 
Maui shine + awapuhi shampoo (once a week) 
As I am cowash (ever other day to a couple of days) 
The only treatment I use is Shea moisture leave in treatment (this weighs my hair down) 

I always air dry my hair and have tried plopping it with a t-shirt which works but without products, my hair does retain its waves in some places
I find the as I am cowash hydrating for my hair and doesn‚Äôt weigh my hair down but I feel like it‚Äôs the only product I use that does well for me 

I don‚Äôt have dry hair and don‚Äôt usually have moisture problems, my scalp gets really oily sometimes but the Maui products aren‚Äôt hydrating my hair enough, I feel like that do dry my hair out. 
I just need help on what to use that might work better for me! Thanks for the help in advance! I‚Äôll post pictures on my hair in the comments if that‚Äôll help out!"
Bonitanina,kc4y94,Looks gorgeous!!!
Sugarbooger8,kc4y94,"I posted the other day about my hair struggles and I finally got a good hair day after starting the CGM since June.&&&&&&My rountine is wash with Pantene curl care shampoo, and condition with NYM curl conditioner with a couple drops of protein. Styled with blueberry bliss leave in, Cantu gel, and NYM moose. Micro plopped and diffused until fully dry."
T_chronicles,kc4y94,What are the drops of protein? Trying to figure out a good protein product. Btw your hair looks gorgeous!
Wavyhaircare,kc4op1,"I did the same thing! I read about protein overload early on and was scared of protein. Then when I finally used it, i was in bad moisture overload so the improvement it made was huge."
WeAreStarless,kc4op1,"it's a total myth anyway! i don't know where it comes from, the idea that low porosity needs no protein and that high porosity needs a lot of protein, but porosity and protein/moisture balance are entirely unrelated"
brittathisusername,kc4op1,"Don't scare away from protein just because you have low porosity hair. I've followed strict rules and didn't use protein until now. It's been amazing.&&&&&&Routine: Tea tree triple treat invigorating shampoo and conditioner. Shampoo and condition upside down and comb through conditioner and rinse. 

Squeeze out excess water and squish in blueberry bliss reparative leave in conditioner. The plop in a t-shirt for about 10-15 mins then take down and micro-plop right side up to get my hair in the right place. Air dry. 

Refresh: Spritz with distilled water and kinda scrunch. That's it. 

(I sleep in a silk cap to protect)&&&Yes! I'm so glad I just gave in to try and see what happens. So happy with the results and the stuff smells amazing."
neverseektotell,kc4op1,Is the blueberry bliss the protein-containing product?
zillarillazilla,kc4op1,I agree! I‚Äôm low porosity and my hair has been loving protein!!
Least-Somewhere,kc0yo3,"I have cowlicks and I can‚Äôt plop with gel/mousse at all or they go nuts. I do microplopping or plop with just the leave in or a cream. I also hate that I can‚Äôt get a part when I‚Äôm upside down so style up for a cleaner look, even though my waves aren‚Äôt as intense"
helliebell3,kc0yo3,"How long are you plopping? The longer you do it, the more it can exacerbate cowlicks. Aim for no more than 20 minutes. Something else to think about is that you might not have a straight part at all when wearing your hair curly"
iamchickenssss,kc0yo3,"Creating part in hair??&&&I cannot for the life of me create a part in my hair without separating my clumps and making the top bit of my hair all stringy (even on my best days). I also don‚Äôt have a defined ‚Äúnatural part‚Äù, I have a lot of cowlicks so my hair goes all over the place :( any tips/tricks???

Routine: Shampoo/condition w/NYM Sea Mineral line, prayer hands and squish Kinky curly custard, plop, air dry w/NYM Sea Mineral mousse.&&&OOH never thought about that - I‚Äôll definitely try plopping for less time, thanks! :)&&&No bc I keep my head pretty much upside down the whole time it‚Äôs wet but I‚Äôll give it a shot! Thank you :)"
me-me-123,kc0yo3,Do you part when your hair is sopping wet? I do that before plopping and it usually eliminates any extra frizz or weird separation
vintage-sunrae,kc0yo3,"Same! What seems to work best for me is to not plop, but part my hair with a comb after I get out of the shower. I usually glaze and squish in a curl custard upside down in the shower, get out of the shower and part my hair, then glaze and squish in gel, scrunch with a microfiber towel and let it air dry."
