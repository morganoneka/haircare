chikoritaaaaaaa,kljez3,"Don’t sleep in a plop, your hair should be totally dry when you go to bed! What works for me if I wash at night is I don’t scrunch out the crunch completely and leave my hair with some gel cast and then fluff it out in the morning.

Sleeping in two braids might leave dents in your hair if you already styled it. Some people slee in braids to get that wavy texture the waves give!! If you want to kee your natural waves, try doing a pineapple, or putting your hair in a very loose bun or ponytail on the top of your head (totally dry, of course)."
yo_teach213,kljez3,"I shower the night before and plop my hair into a microfiber turbin. I add a little curl cream or gel starting about 4"" away from my scalp before I plop. I would say about a quarter size.  

When I wake up, my hair is still very wet. I add more product and diffuse until it's as dry as I want it and then I'm good to go! 

A few notes:

- I have A LOT of hair--like I need to book two hair appointments because it takes that long. 
- I go to sleep late and wake up early, so this may not work if you have a reasonable sleep schedule 😬
- I struggle to tame frizz on ""refresh"" days. It looks great after this routine, but it's a real pain to get my hair soaked because it takes so long to dry. I don't know if my routine hinders that at all, but thought I should note anyway."
zygonsinvade,kljez3,"two quick questions from a beginner!&&&i've tried the cgm in the past but abandoned it after persistent stringy waves. finally giving it another go! two things though:

1. i use gel and scrunch out the crunch. should i plop overnight and scrunch the next morning? or scrunch out before bed...?
2. i used to sleep in 2 braids almost every night; it's basically the only way i found my hair acceptable haha. is it ok to do this in tandem with the cgm or is it wrecking my natural waves? 

TIA!&&&thank you so so much!! i have shoulder length hair so can i put it in two buns on the side? while dry :)"
Jnad1,kljalu,"Hi, your post is super helpful but I'm new here so what does a hard cast mean? I'm so overwhelmed and frustrated by my hair rn 😭"
plants_and_art,kljalu,"Round 2 of attempting to coax out my waves was a success! Pics of round 1, my stick-straight silicone-soaked ""before"" hair, and a very detailed routine description!&&&&&&**Routine (and background):**

I started CGM in September with moderate success, but a lot of the products I was trying irritated my scalp and I didn't feel like doing my hair just to work in my living room off camera. I've been using some combo of the below products since mid-november but none of the techniques. I used a mask a few time that I  think was messing with my curl pattern since it had coconut and in it.

I've had really nice hair the last two wash days with the below technique - Merry Christmas to me!

Start with day 5 hair both times (definitely past when I should have washed it, but…..)

**Night before:** a few pumps of Pacifica High Ends Hair & Body Oil, distributed and rubbed into my scalp/roots. My scalp gets super dry/itchy in the winter and this has helped a lot. It does have a pretty strong smell.

**Shower:** I do all my washing standing up, not with my head upside-down. Wash with liberal amounts of Matrix Biolage ScalpSync Shampoo, fully rinse. Wash with Johnson's Head-to-Toe Baby Wash & Shampoo. Put in a liberal amount (~3 T) of Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle Conditioner and squish it through my hair up to about an inch from my scalp, but I don't rub it in to my scalp. I stick it in a bun while I do the rest of my shower things, then I rinse it out fully with cool water. At this point, I flip my head over and fully saturate with water.

I did the double-wash the last two times because my hair was so dirty. The Matrix Shampoo is what I used before CGM, and I feel bad throwing it out. I'll reevaluate when I run out. I tried not using sulfates, and my scalp was not having it.

**Post-Shower:** I spray NYM Royal Honey & Kalahari Desert Melon Leave-In liberally and squish as I go until it feels saturated and starts to clump. I add the next products by coating my hands with a single product, and then squishing it in fully. ½ t of NYM Curl Talk Defining Cream, then ¼ c of NYM Curl Talk Mousse, then 3 T of LA Looks Sport Gel. After all this, I sort of squish sections of hair into a single ""column"" of hair to get them to stick, then scrunch up towards my head. When I do this a few times it makes the clumps way more defined. I then plop in a long-sleeved t-shirt for ~30 minutes. I can dress, do my skincare routine, clean up the water I dripped everywhere, and make coffee.

**Drying:** I do my beat to part my hair at this point. I use the Xtava Diffuser and Hairdryer. I put my hair in the dryer as shown in the photo, then turn it on to high speed and ⅔ heat for 2 minutes, then cool blast for about 30 seconds, turn off the dryer, then move the dryer. I go over my hair in 4 sections and go around my head 3 times. I stay right-side up for this whole process so I can eat, drink, read on my phone. It's not 100% dry at this point, but it works.

I don't get a super hard cast, but I do avoid touching much for a few hours.&&&Thank you!! I keep surprising myself in the mirror because I've never had this kind of texture!&&&Thank you!!! I had these little ringlets that would show up in my baby hairs ONLY when it would lightly rain with my hair pulled back. It was my sign to try CGM and I'm blown away by the difference!"
sagefairyy,kljalu,Your hair looks so good!!
summercampforsadists,kljalu,"Aaa, your progress is so good! I also started out with straight straight hair. I love your hair wavy."
Clean-Hamster-3023,kliruz,"Need help troubleshooting!! From super low maintenance and curly to fluffy and flat (somehow at the same time)!!!&&&Help!!!!

I need some advice because I am SO FRUSTRATED. I have 2b/2c curls and am not sure about my porosity. I started CGM-ish last year in October and immediately saw amazing results (first pic). At the time I was just using Maui Moisture Shea Butter Shampoo + Conditioner and Giovanni Direct Leave-in. I wasnt plopping, was airdrying with no stylers, washed my hair everyday and my hair was PERFECT.  In February my hair started to lose its curl and I thought I had over moisturized so I may have over corrected and suddenly there was protein in all my products. For the last 4 months I was using the Curl Talk shampoo and the Maui Moisture Curl quench with the giovanni leave in but my hair was flash drying and super stringy and dry even when it was wet with TONS of wet frizz. I thought the problem was Aloe so I switched my products. Today (2nd pic) I tried using Curl Talk shampoo, Shea Moisture coconut hibiscus conditioner, and kinky curly knot today and plopped for a while then air dried. My hair was super slippery in the shower which was awesome but now is super fluffy and has no volume on top and Ive lost curl definition. The main place Ive noticed a change is in my bangs and I want my curly bangs back so bad! Any suggestions? Thank you for your advice in advance!

I did one try of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey protein treatment in a blue bottle and nothing changed drastically but maybe I need something more concentrated. Thank you!"
pissgender,kliruz,"have you tried an actual protein treatment? for me personally when I am over moisturized just using products with protein in it isn't enough to bring it back to balanced...I have to bring in the big guns. I use ecoslay's matcha boost which is literally just hydrolyzed protein in water, it's great!"
BeLynLynSh,klfq32,"My Prose hasn’t arrived yet but I did the quiz and have an order on the way! I went a little buck wild and got a hair mask, shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, and hair oil, so I’ll let you know how it goes. I can’t speak for FOB, but Prose talked a lot about re-evaluating your formula once you’ve tried it, so if I don’t get the results I want I can have them tweak my formula if I choose to reorder. They also have the option where you can send in hair photos for further evaluation."
littlegardenbirds,klfq32,I'm using function of beauty. I find the shampoo lasts for ages but my first conditioner was really watery and ran out much quicker. I've been using a drugstore conditioner to finish using up the shampoo and I find the drugstore conditioners to not work as nicely on my hair. I've just bought more fob and this time chose curl defining instead of colour protection. The conditioner is much thicker and made my hair feel very soft after using. I'm very much at the beginning of my hair journey and I kept silicones in my formula so I can't really comment on how it holds waves yet.
ljwedding,klfq32,"Currently using function of beauty. I really liked it at first, but over time, it's seemed like there's buildup in my hair. I did like the natural texture of my hair though for awhile  without having to put any additional product in it. My experiences may differ from the next person though. Since this is a custom product and relies heavily on the customer ticking off the right boxes for what results they're looking for, I am taking my own results with a grain of salt. Haven't tried prose so can't speak to that."
megant113,klfq32,"I tried Prose a couple of months ago, shortly before deciding to stop heat styling my hair straight again. I wasn't a fan. It was super pricey and left my hair worse off than before I started. My hair ended up straw like and staticky, both things I don't normally deal with.

The silver lining is that that was one of the contributing factors to me trying to go wavy again. 😊"
mimisdailydose,klfq32,What was your formula? I’m seriously considering getting it but for that price I‘m just not sure yet.
official_koda_,klfq32,"I don’t suggest function of beauty. I used it as my only shampoo and conditioner for about a year and started having hair loss, and I wasn’t having any medical issues. I don’t think it’s all formulas that cause hair loss, but I believe there is a certain one that has cause hair loss in myself and plenty of others."
swminn,klfq32,Prose or function of beauty?&&&Has anyone tried or is currently using either of these? Does it seem to work for your hair better than drugstore products?
Midnight_madness8,kles4p,It happens to me occasionally. I only have shoulder length hair but it seems to happen more when my hair needs more moisture ... Maybe a factor?
kansas_hooper,kles4p,"What the hell just happened?&&&Please help me understand what I’m doing wrong. 

My hair is waist length, 2a/2b, high porosity i think, And very damaged from YEARS of color abuse (it’s currently purple and I have no plans of going back to normal hair colors any time soon. Thank god for Olaplex) 

Today is wash day for me. I use Bumble and Bumble Curl shampoo and have recently switched to SheaMoisture Curl and Shine conditioner. I usually finger rake my hair to detangle then squish to condish, rinse out, and use Curl Crème Brûle curl cream. Apply that with prayer hands and then lightly scrunch then t-shirt plop. When I took my hair down from the plop to diffuse I noticed the back was a god damn hot mess. I tried to finger rake to calm it down but this caused a tangle mess. 

I go back to the bathroom to spray my hair down to brush and my hair was so tangled up I ended up washing all the curl cream back out and re-applying conditioner. This time I used my wet brush to detangle and it took me 45 minutes!!! Every time I’d turn my head to the side, my hair would tangle right back up in MASSIVE knots. I finally gave up, brushed it out upside down, applied curl cream, and I’m t-shirt plopping again. 

Does everyone else’s hair do this when they turn to the side???? What is happening???&&&I’m going to try to find a good cruelty free and color safe deep conditioner soon. For some reason the combo of cruelty free, color safe, and CGM approved is hard to find. I’m also getting a haircut at the end of January so I’m hoping that helps too. I’m just so frustrated from today’s experience I’m thiiiiiiis close to giving up."
HanSav,kla630,Following. I live in the desert myself.
Impressive_Bus1284,kla630,"Hair sun protection that’s silicone free?&&&I’ve been doing a CGM-lite routine that I’m still figuring out, but basically am looking for a silicone-free sun protection product for my hair. I live in the Middle Eastern desert and while I don’t go out in harsh sun that often, I’m still looking to use something on the occasions I do. 

All hair UVA/UVB protecting products I’ve seen seem to have silicones, so I’m wondering if anyone has recommendations that are silicone free? I’ve looked into living proof but it’s a bit expensive and also hard to get my hands on here. 

Thanks ☺️"
Nibblinsquirrel,kla630,"Hmmm the only product that I know of that has uv protection is also expensive and hard to find. It's called 12 benefits healthy hair treatment, but it's basically a light leave in. I can't really think of anything else, sorry if this isn't particularly helpful!"
FuzzyJury,kl7eiw,"Aw your mask is so cute! Mind if I ask where you got it? Also, pretty hair!"
Grateful_Breadd,kl7eiw,Beautiful hair
MynameisntLinda,kl7eiw,Beautiful curls!
VintageWitchcraft,kl7eiw,"Very pretty, a lot of girls even use hair straighteners in order to get this wave effect in their hair. 

I love seeing people embrace their texture!"
bkogut81,kl7eiw,"Those are full on curls, my friend!"
eveleanon,kl7eiw,Beautiful! I’d say these are curls!
falloutgrungemaster,kl7eiw,What’s SOTC? sorry I’m new here!
mlki0315,kl7eiw,"Finally trying to embrace the waves after 6+ years of daily straightening! Here’s my progress.&&&&&&For my routine, I wash my hair every second day with Pantene Curl Care Jojoba Oil Shampoo and then use the conditioner from the same line. I use Dippity Do Girls With Curls Gel mixed with some water and scrunch it through my hair. Then I use a cotton t-shirt and scrunch to get rid of some of the excess water, and leave it to air dry (I’ve tried diffusing and my hair just ends up very stringy, not sure what I’m doing wrong!). I then SOTC once it’s completely dry. Also recently used the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt Protein Treatment and it gave my hair a lot more definition! My hair is very fine and quite thin (and high porosity, I believe!) Very heat damaged from straightening everyday for many years.&&&Oh I know exactly how you feel! I was so demotivated after the first month or two, but I just kept trying different products and techniques and slowly things started coming together! It definitely gets better. You got this :) !&&&Thank you! The mask is actually just a plain black one with a bear emoji on top of the image (I wasn’t sure if I wanted to cover my face with an emoji or a mask for this post so I just combined them lol). I do believe you can get masks with this emoji on websites such as Redbubble though!"
plinkamalinka,kl7eiw,"Thanks for sharing! This gave me hope, as I was so demotivated by the results of all my hair care, but well I've been only doing it for two months it WILL get better!"
ruggedlamp,kl7eiw,Wow these are defiantly goals!
zillarillazilla,kl7eiw,"Looks beautiful! 

Diffusing hasn’t worked for me either, but I’m having some success with “the hammock method” - hard to explain but you put the hair dryer on the counter, flip your hair upside down, and put it in a t-shirt/towel “hammock style” and focus on drying the roots"
BlondieFromSeattle,kl3pb7,"Personally I really like it. I have highlights and the top layer of my hair is pretty fried.  When I use olaplaex I notice more curls especially in those damaged sections. Its a concentrated treatment and a little goes a long way. I've had the same bottle since August and  using it Bi-Weekly I still have half left. In terms of cost per use it seems to be in line with other ""cheaper"" treatments I've tried."
Cake_4_Life,kl3pb7,"I say give it a go. I got a bottle a couple of months ago and its lasting me forever (thats says a lot considering my hair is tailbone length). I didn't notice a drastic change in curl pattern/tightness, but overall health has definetly improved for my bleached hair."
Daisyfay1414,kl3pb7,Especially with bleached hair I can recommend it
Greatrisk,kl3pb7,"Yep I’ve used it and I like it. I have 2b-c waves with a few 3a’s. It was extremely damaged from daily straightening and is now recovering nicely. I have used it 3-4 times, and I find it gives my hair obvious structure, similar to a protein treatment, but like, hard core lol. Worth a try for sure."
Jenn-bird1217,kl3pb7,I super wanna try it. I’ve heard good things but the main one is to not expect anything drastic especially from the first use. Olaplex restore bonds inside the hair unlike other hair restoring products which only work on the surface area. So it could take a few tries before seeing real results.
ausheidi,kl3pb7,"I used it on like 2b-3a hair, my hair is straighter underneath and has some spirals almost on top. It didn’t do much and I lost some curl enhancement until my next wash. I did it because it was free from my hairdresser but I definitely wouldn’t pay for it in hopes of changing my curls. Hope that helps."
caroper2487,kl3pb7,Super expensive but worth it. It helped my hair after I murdered it with bleach.
midget_chloe,kl3pb7,"Olaplex on wavy hair&&&Has anyone used Olaplex no 3 on their hair?

I have previously bleached hair with a box dye brown put over it. Hair looks dry, with about 2b waves. My top layer is definitely more damaged, the under layer is a lot softer and curls more naturally 

Just wondering if anyone can tell me about their experience? Its quite an expensive treatment so want to make sure its worth it&&&Thanks for your comments everyone! Will defs give it a try!"
ndsales,kl3pb7,"I have bleach on my wavy hair, and I love Olaplex!! I use it about once a month."
8MonthsofWinter,kl1hs6,"I have very similar hair to yours and absolutely cannot rake product through my hair. I use the grazing method to apply product and then scrunch it in and that works much better at keeping the clumps bigger. 

Also highly recommend a lot of what was mentioned already... 1. Less product in general. 2. Only lightweight products (KatherinePageWaves on IG has great info that was helpful to me in finding lightweight products). I definitely can’t use curl cream or my hair ends up flat with so much less wave 3. Applying to soaking wet hair and add even more water during styling if necessary"
Cllorento,kl1hs6,"It's been said a few times but keeping my hair as wet as possible while applying products always seems to help me with getting bigger clumps. 

Also I have tried washing my hair in the evening a few times and sleeping with the almost dry cast in a pineapple. That helps me avoid the temptation to scrunch out the crunch before my hair is completely dry."
EpitaFelis,kl1hs6,Praying hands helped for me in creating bigger curl clumps. You spread the styling product with hands clapped together instead of raking it in.
Greatrisk,kl1hs6,Try not plopping - it doesn’t work for everyone (including me) and can break up clumps and make them stringy. I microplop instead and it works much better.
Least-Somewhere,kl1hs6,Mousse always makes my hair stringier for some reason. I actually get better results with gel or just a leave in. Ag recoil has given me some pretty waves too&&&I started using a wet brush and it’s made a world of difference. I brush my gel or cream (I’ve been using Ag recoil) in my hair to get it evenly distributed and better clumps. Also adding it on super wet hair. It gets stringier on damp hair. I micro plop rather than plopping as well.
RadishDerp,kl1hs6,"I started out stringy and frizzy! I think part of it for me was damage from bleaching as well as heat damage. Something I wanted to ask though is how wet your hair is when you're applying your stylers? One of my issues was that my hair wasn't wet enough so it wasn't sticking together, now I make sure my hair is wet enough to make a squelching sound when I scrunch, which helps the clumps form!"
Son114,kl1hs6,What exactly does ‘stringy’ mean? I hear it on this and curly sub all the time. Does it mean thin clumps? I have that issue but I don’t know if that can be solved.. always thought that’s how my hair is.
Tigerlily49,kl1hs6,"I would make sure my hair is soaking wet before putting any product in it. Try to not scrunch with a towel/T-shirt, until your product has been applied. A little of some light scrunching with with a microfiber towel/T-shirt, then plop. Time will vary with how long you need to plop for. The idea is to create a “clump” or clumps. This would mean that a chunk of hair will stick together to create one curl/wave. After plopping is a step you could play around with, like air drying or diffusing your hair. Don’t forget to SOTC!! My tip here is to use an oil to glaze over my curls/waves while using praying hands and then lightly SOTC. I wish you the best of luck in your journey!"
betsyyyyyy,kl1hs6,Just from reading your routine I would say to try and not touch it much at all when diffusing to try to get the gel to cast! Then once it’s completely dry you can scrunch out the crunch.
builtthiscityon,kl1hs6,"Denman brush to style. A real one. 

Olaplex no 3 always helps my clumps to form 

Try mousse or cream to style"
hainic0,kl1hs6,"I saw that others recommended mouse instead of curl cream, which definitely made a difference in my case!

Some other things to try (not sure if they've been mentioned yet):
Try applying gel after plopping. That seems to help my hair clump better. 
Have you tried air drying rather than diffusing? My clumps apparently love air drying, especially in cool air. They hate the heat of the diffuser!"
hooperluna,kl1hs6,"Tips for less ‘stringy’ looking curls? I started my attempt at CGM on December 24th. These are from days 1 and 2.&&&&&&Oh! Very good to know. Anything to help them stay together lol. Thank you!&&&Ooo yes good call adding as much moisture as possible I will give that a go tomorrow!&&&So far I’m using...
Marc Antony curl conditioner and shampoo
(Only shampoo on scalp, then conditioner on wet hair, brush out with my wet brush, then squish to condish) 
I use a curl cream on wet hair 
Then a gel on wet hair 
Then I plop for about 15 
Then scrunch while diffusing 
I have a silk pillow case 

So far I’ve been washing everyday because my I’m not living for my stringy curls and hoping that a new wash will bring me something new but so far no luck. I know it’s only been like 3 days but it feels like it’s been a month lol. 
 
Can’t remember the names of the last two products. Just on break at work wishing I had better curls and feeling irrationally impatient about this process lol.

Anyone else start out stringy and frizzy?&&&Ooo ! I haven’t tried mousse yet but maybe I should give it a go. Also I haven’t tried skipping the gel. So many options to experiment with. I wouldn’t necessarily have thought of skipping the gel so thank you :)&&&Thank you! That is encouraging. Also think I’m gonna give my hair a bit of a trim and chop so say goodbye to the straw I’ve created lol&&&Haha yes! Oh the faces we make on our journeys for the curl lol Thank you! I really appreciate that!&&&Oh thank you! I’ll check this out :) and sadly my hair starts to become like this while scrunching. But after reading a bunch here I think what I’m doing is scrunching the crunch before there is a ‘crunch’ lol. So I’m going to really wait til I have a gel cast today hopefully that helps 😅"
lhaynie,kl1hs6,"This is what happens for me when I apply product and my hair isn't really wet. I see that you said you apply it to wet hair but of your hair dries really quickly, you may have to re-wet it."
minnielargo,kl1hs6,"My waves looked like that in the beginning of doing CGM too, it took over 6 months before I started seeing more clumping. Stick with it!"
mkf52,kl1hs6,"I've seen the Denman suggestion a bunch of times, might you have any idea why these brushes work to make better clumps?"
moose8617,kl1hs6,You want to create curl clumps. Try using a denman brush.
ndcdshed,kl1hs6,"Try a denman brush to clump waves, no plopping and apply products to very wet hair. My waves are a lot less stringy doing this."
neverseektotell,kl1hs6,"More water, less conditioner, glaze/rope in your products without raking"
notokaythanks,kl1hs6,"Tbh it looks good to me!

Do you find you have clumps at any point in your routine and lose them? Or never have them to begin with? 

I’m gonna link my post so you can see the video I used and what my routine is and my before/after.

princesszoom101,kl1hs6,Same here. I apply product in the shower when my hair is soaking then scrunch out extra water later. Helps prevent stringiness

Have you tried mousse? Or just doing the curl creme without the gel?"
thesuzy,kl1hs6,"Try using less product. Also try a day where you just use the cream, a day where you just use the gel, and if it’s been awhile, a day where you use nothing at all. It will help you learn what each product does specifically, then you can decide if or how to combine them.

My hair is fine, although not as fine as yours. I’ve lately just been using Kinky Curly curl custard and love it. If you prefer creams, try Briogeo’s curl cream or Aveda’s."

Animasylvania,kktkcb,I think maybe using a clarifying shampoo. Especially since you switched to sulfate free shampoo which sometimes isn't as good at getting built up product out. I would stick with the sulfate free but then clarify every once in a while. Maybe once every two weeks or so? I guess it depends on the person for how often.
Littlelungss,kktkcb,"I would skip the curl cream and swap out cowash for shampoo. For protein treatment, I recently picked up TPH by TARAJI real love mask and it’s added structure to my hair."
SadlyNotanAlien,kktkcb,"Hair seems limp, won't get a cast anymore and losing its curl?&&&Hello people who know way more about hair than I do!

I think maybe my hair is over moisturized? But I used the curl junky repair me! Protein treatment and it made no difference. The first time I used that treatment my hair felt strong, held its curl, and even a tiny bit dry. Now, my hair is limp and refuses to hold its waves and will no longer get a cast from my gel when it used to. (note: it felt this way before the treatment, I thought the treatment would help but no luck!) my hair also seems to take forever to dry... Not sure if that means anything. 

I have a lot of fine hair. 2b on average with 2a and 2c in the mix, though my hair mostly looks 2a right now with the issues I'm having. Pretty sure it's high porosity as well. 


My routine:

*Sunday*

-As I am coconut co wash
-Shea Moisture Cannabis hemp seed oil lush length conditioner (brush through upside down, StC, and rinse all out) 
-As I am leave in conditioner (comb through, StC) 
-leave the shower and apply Dippity Doo Girls with Curls Curl Cream (praying hands, then scrunch in) 
-Giovanni Styling Gel (praying hands, then scrunch in) 
-plop with t-shirt for about an hour
-diffuse if I want to look nice for a meeting lol, air dry if I'm just sitting around doing quarantine things


*Thursday* (basically the same as Sunday with a couple differences) 

-Shampoo with whatever shampoo I am experimenting with as I haven't found one I love yet. Last 2 weeks have been the Shea Moisture Cannabis hemp seed oil lush length shampoo which is the first sulfate free shampoo I have used. 

-Shea Moisture Cannabis hemp seed oil lush length conditioner (brush through upside down, StC, and rinse all out)

-diffuse if I want to look nice for a meeting lol, air dry if I'm just sitting around doing quarantine things


Please help... I have no idea what I'm doing.

Happy holidays!


Edit: the in-between days I spray my hair with water and scrunch in curl cream and gel, then plop and air dry&&&Thank you! I have clarifying shampoo I'll use on my wash day and see if that helps! 

What is chelate? Also, I'll have to look at porosity definitions again... I'm still learning

Thank you again for your reply :)&&&Thank you!  good idea- I'll simplify my routine and see where that takes me.

I do find the cowash pretty moisture heavy..

Also I'll look up that conditioner. I am in no way attached to my shampoo/conditioner&&&I'm definetly going to do this... I feel like the as I am products are too much for my hair! Especially how frequently I use them&&&Good plan, thanks for the vote, seems to be the consensus so far&&&Thank you! I will checkout the product!&&&Thanks for the tips! It stretches a normal amount before snapping I'm pretty sure. I think I'm going to clarify and regular condition this week and that's it. See how my hair feels afterwards.

Thank you!"
archnonymous,kktkcb,"A good clarifying might help with this issue!! It seems like your routine has a lot of moisture in it that might be building up on your fine hair. I don't know about that line of SM but that's usually the problem.

To problem solve, I usually try moisture, protein, clarify, chelate (I had moderately hard water).

As well, I think if your hair takes long to dry it might be lower porosity than you think? I could be wrong on this though!!"
bemydarkling,kktkcb,I vote too much moisture. That’s what happens to my hair. I have to amp up the protein and dial back the conditioner.
betsyyyyyy,kktkcb,"That happens to me when I use too many products in one routine that are catered towards curly hair and not wavy hair - so my vote is over moisture as well! My hair seems similar to yours -2b ish, fine, and low porosity. Products made for curly hair can be waaaay too much moisture for my hair depending on the product. But some things work great so it’s just a trial and error. 
I second the suggestion on doing some clarifying, and maybe a less is more approach to products for awhile until your hair adjusts back to normal."
chelliex2,kktkcb,"If you take a strand of your hair in your hands and attempt to stretch it, does it snap immediately or stretch?
This test is pretty much the standard for testing protein or moisture needs. If it immediately snaps... you need moisture. If it stretches then you need protein. If it's just a small stretch before snapping you've got a happy medium.. and you probably just need a clarifying wash and simplify your routine for a bit to see what it is your hair hates. Lol.

You can also test your hairs porosity by sticking it a glass/cup/bowl of water. Depending on if it floats, sinks, or floats in the middle will determine your porosity."
dazedg,kktkcb,"It could definitely be too much moisture. You might want to consider simplifying your routine for a few weeks with just a shampoo, conditioner, and one styling product. That way you can figure out which products are causing the limpness. You might also want to reduce how often you use the as I am cowash. I also have 2a/ 2b fine hair and I find that when I use that more than once in a row my hair gets kind of limp like what you describe. I’d also make sure that your conditioner or styling product has enough protein in it. I like the bounce curl cream conditioner which has a ton of protein."
pcgirl1965,kktkcb,I would suggest also skipping the curl cream.  I personally have no success with creams.  They weigh my hair down.
hainic0,kktjcp,"A week of progress (last pic shows what I thought my natural hair pattern/texture was)&&&&&&They're still here and kicking at almost 6 pm! But I wonder if that's because I left the gel in for a looooong time (like 3 hours ha). I feel like the longer the gel is in before scrunching out the crunch, the more longevity the waves have later. And since I almost never have anywhere important to go because COVID, I'll leave it in there a while and forget about it.&&&Routine (copied from previous post):

1. Shower and use Macademia Oil deep conditioner; squish to condish 
2. Dry a little bit and scrunch with cotton t shirt 
3. Section out hair into top and bottom sections and scrunch in Ogx coconut curls mouse 
4. Plop for 15 ish mins 
5. Section out hair and scrunch in Ecostyler olive oil gel 
6. Let air dry, including spending time outside in cold colorado air
7. Scrunch out the crunch with hands&&&Thanks! I actually don't know what it looks like when I don't plop (but still scrunch/use product). Plopping for a short amount of time seems to work for me, so I've done it each time. I'll report back if I try the routine without plopping!"
littleprojects,kktjcp,Your hair’s texture/wave pattern looks a LOT like mine! Did these waves last all day? Do you have any issues with your waves straightening out over the course of the day?
summercampforsadists,kktjcp,What is your hair like when you don’t plop? I have 2b-ish hair and I always find that plopping makes my hair super weird. So I’m wondering what yours is like if you don’t. I love the beachy texture you have!!
Least-Somewhere,kkpxob,"So those methods aren’t meant to transform your hair into something it’s not. So if you hair is wavy, it’s not going to transform it into 3a curls. I would mostly focus on getting your hair healthy and finding products that don’t weigh your hair down"
Midnight_madness8,kkpxob,"I'm somewhere between 2a and 2c and finer coiling does not work for me. The only time I use it in any capacity is refreshing, sometimes if a face framing curl is looking real straggly I'll finger coil it with damp hands and a touch of leave in. It works sometimes. Brushing sometimes helps for me, but if I overbrush, it makes my hair stringy. You kind of just have to experiment with different strategies, and it may end up that you need a routine that uses a very basic technique, like gently running product over your hair and scrunching a little. It may help you to find people with hair like yours on instagram or Facebook, and see what techniques they use."
NotSoManicPixi,kkpxob,"You didn't say at what point in your routine you try finger coiling? Keep in mind that finger coiling or curl training work to *enhance* the existing curl pattern not create new ones, so you definitely need to figure out the direction your hair curls work.

Personally, finger coiling / curl training, or brushing don't work for me either on normal wash days, but when I'm doing the Olaplex no.3 treatment, I finger coil it when (saw this on Swavy Curly Courtney on Youtube). Maybe try doing it if you're doing a leave-in treatment of some kind (or hair mask) and not on your usual wash days? Or try clipping in coils *when* it's drying? 

It will definitely take a while for your hair to learn to be in it's 'natural' wavy form and to find products that keep it moisturised and not weighed down, as someone pointed out. I also definitely understand that 'normal' curly hair strategies can't work the same way for wavies, YMMV. I squish-to-condish when showering, and then scrunch after mousse/gel, and this works well for me, and of course, letting it dry completely before touching it to SOTC and not tying it in tight hairstyles after."
nah_mydude,kkpxob,"Finger coiling... Yay or nay?&&&So I've got type two hair(too early in my progress to tell the shape) with pretty fine strands. My hair tends to adhere to shape pretty well, but it's seeming like whenever I do the normal curl helping strategies, I go directly to straight hair. Denman brush, completely suffocated wave pattern; finger coil, completely suffocated wave pattern. The thing is, I've only really seen these techniques demonstrated on black people with around type four hair. My hair is very european, so are these sorts  of techniques just not meant for hair like mine?
If not, what can I do instead?"
KermitSewerSlide2000,kkppz2,That's...quite the tough one! I have heard of slighty different patterns and textures but not this different! How does the thickness compare at the roots? And have you dyed/bleached your hair recently
Lala77_,kkppz2,"Just a few questions, 

is the finer hair in the top layers mostly? do you have any scalp issues (dandruff, itchy, dry

)

do you comb your hair often, wear it in buns of ponytails or any other style that pulls on hair?"
No_Goose_4291,kkppz2,Following for some answers
Vegetable-Toe-4683,kkppz2,"My hair looks really similar! I asked about this in my own post (it's the only other thing I've ever posted so you could probably find it by just clicking my username lol) and someone said it might be stretching damage. I know I can be a little aggressive with a hairbrush, I brushed all the time before starting CGM (sort of) and now still do every once in a while. Given your comments I'm not sure that's the case, I can't imagine pulling at your hair could cause so much damage like this. I really don't know what to do about it, when I looked up ""stretching damage"" all that came up were targeted to type 4 hair. Maybe there's a different name? Whatever it is I'm pretty confident that's what's going on with my hair, which looks identical to yours in the second/third photos, so it could probably be addressed the same way (I could be completely wrong though lol). Good luck finding solutions! I'd definitely be interested to hear if you find anything that helps, I can't find any ways to reverse my damage."
jenastelli,kkppz2,"Help understand my weird-ass wavy hair texture (damage?)&&&&&&Hi there,
So this is maybe a weirdo request but I’ve been reading in this and r/curlygirl for months and can’t seem to figure out my hair texture. I have mostly pretty fine hair, mixed with these much thicker, dented strands that seem damaged. 
*Current routine* is CGM-adjacent. I use Living Proof cleansing conditioner and only wash 2x/week. I use Neutrogena clarifying shampoo every 4-6 weeks. Generally after a shower I comb Kristen Ess’s conditioning mask as a leave-in and let it plop for a bit, then air dry. I will also sometimes use praying hand and work gel and/or Shea Moisture curl smoothie with the conditioner.

I haven’t used heat styling since March, no silicones in probably years, and I’ve had these hairs as long as I can remember. I was hoping this change in routine would overall make my hair healthier but tbh I haven’t noticed much of an improvement in the last 9-10 months (I’m also overdue for a trim which isn’t helping). I do use Olaplex 3 every month or so and haven’t noticed much of a change.

Is this too much protein? Not enough? Product recs and insight welcome!!!&&&It is definitely thicker at the root (and dented at the root and at various other sections of the strand). I did get a few highlights in June but this hair is from the back of my hair and most like this I find are not highlighted. It’s so weird 😭&&&Yes! Mostly in my top layers. My hair on the lower part of my head (like when my hair is half up) has perfect curls and it soft and fine - which is why I think it’s damage. I don’t comb my hair much/at all unless I’m conditioning it, though I do have a nervous tendency to pull on my hair 😑

ETA - no known scalp issues"
pissgender,kkppz2,"oh my hair is like this (weird, coarse hairs among fine ""normal"" hairs). as far as I know it's totally natural and isn't damage as I've had them my whole life. they're just there I guess. I've also had coarse white hairs scattered around my head my whole life too so I'm not sure if that indicates anything else ..."
Daisyfay1414,kknram,"I would recommend seeing a curl hair specialist since it could be a lot of different things (porosity, humidity where you live, caused by products too harsh like sulfates, ingredients like glycerin)"
Least-Somewhere,kknram,"For me the biggest difference was adding a leave in conditioner. I’ve used not your mothers and as I am but like nym a little bit more.

 I have mostly 2a/b with a couple random ringlets if I just use leave in. Mousse makes my hair stringy and gel makes pretty waves but less ringlets. So it’s trial and error to see what your hair needs."
businescasualunicorn,kknram,"I have had S curls underneath and frizzy not quite straight hair on the outside for forever. My hair is super thick and naturally red, so the follicle itself is thicker than normal. Unmanageable doesn’t begin to describe it. 

I stumbled into a curlygirl subreddit and learned a lot! I have taken to the DevaCurl hair care line. I use one of their deep conditioners every shower after using their daily cream conditioner which I use in place of shampoo. When I’m letting the deep conditioner set (the second conditioner) I use a beard comb to brush the  tangles out of my hair. Once I’ve rinsed out most of the conditioner I drape my hair forward over my head and finish the rinse that way kind of scrunching the sectioning upwards towards my head to encourage the curls/waves to reform. When I leave the shower I used to rub my hair to dry it and twist in in a towel but I DO NOT do that anymore. Now I immediately apply a DC leave in conditioner to lightly dripping wet hair (scrunch out what I can in the shower) then their supercream curl styler in the same upward scrunch motion. I tried gels and it made my hair look like trash. I use a microfiber towel (helps reduce frizz) that I use in combination with alligator clips to “plop” my hair on the top of my head for 1-3 hours (it’s that thick). I diffuse in sections until 80% dry. It has made a noticeable difference for me for day one. I have not mastered not looking a hot mess day 2 and beyond, but I have some things I’m still going to try to get there. I’m learning myself and I’m sure I’m doing stuff wrong. Nonetheless I hope this helps! :-)"
ftr-mmrs,kknram,"Please head over to r/curlyhair and check out thie Beginners Quickstart Guide. Look for the pinned threr labeled ""Start here!"" At the top of that thread is an infographic with all the basic ideas.

The guide recommends cowashing, but you can use a sulfate-free shampoo (low-poo) instead for cleansing.

i dont know what a type 2a 2h is. But often times hair properties are more important than curl pattern."
madds0804,kknram,Help!&&&I have struggled with my hair forever. It’s always been super frizzy and thick. My hair has always had a natural wave to it and my baby hairs underneath are super wiry and curlier than the rest. I took the hair code quiz and I am a 2a 2h. Are there any recommendations for shampoo/conditioner/other products to minimize my frizzy hair and define my waves? And is it possible to do that and have my hair be soft/smooth?
HiHungryImDad25,kkgg6u,Do it! Love some wavy hair with curtain bangs so deliciously 70s
S4mm1,kkgg6u,I have thin and ultra fine 2b hair and I love mine. See pics =) https://i.imgur.com/poPZIf3.jpg https://i.imgur.com/7n0vvGQ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/SIGPbx7.jpg
allthedarlings,kkgg6u,"Curtain bangs ??&&&I’m having one of those GETTING BANGS IS A GREAT IDEA moments. Any feedback about long curtain bangs for long, thick 2B hair.&&&Looks amazing!! :) :) :)
My hair is thick and fuzzy lol"
neverseektotell,kkgg6u,Check how your hair lies at the front. Bangs are far too much hassle for me because my forehead is cowlick central. Nothing lies the way it’s supposed to. Be prepared to have to work around your partner much more than with long hair.
Botanisosurus_Rex,kkbuya,"Merry Whatever You Celebrate my fellow wavies! First time doing pigtails since starting this journey. Loved it!&&&&&&I wash/style with all NYM Curl Talk. Wash upside down, scrunch in leave in while soaking wet, apply gel after doing mircoplop with a tshirt, then plop in a tshirt! Boom! Easy lol"
