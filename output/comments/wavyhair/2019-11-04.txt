Ilovegarlicbread101,du6wyn,"Recently just found out my hair was wavy. (I'm thinking 2A) Any product recommendations?&&&&&&Surprisingly my hair is never frizzy. And I'm fairly happy with it I just need some products that will replace the aloe vera gel I'm currently using. So something that will give my hair definition, hold, and definitely some volume to my hair.&&&Yes, I have been doing the CGM method. Well, a modified version lol. Kirkland brand stuff and aloe vera gel. And probably a little bit of both. And I've been meaning to a get a diffuser to see if that would help. Also thanks for the recommendations! The only other problems I have is that my hair gets greasy super fast and sometimes I have no volume to my hair."
ItGirl66,du6wyn,"To be honest, you already have what everyone else is trying to achieve: soft, smooth, frizz-free waves/curls. This picture is my dream hair as another wavy. 

If you arenâ€™t happy with your hair, what exactly are you trying to improve? That way I could make specific product recommendations."
LaneyLuv,du6wyn,"Do you do the curly girl method? 
What kind or results are you looking for? Hold, definition, etc? Youâ€™re hair does look lovely as it is ðŸ™‚
I am 2a-2b and use the V05 conditioners (I like the strawberry one) because theyâ€™re so light weight and never weigh down my hair. If I want a little hold I like AG:Recoil, which is more of a curl cream, or Deva Curl Wave maker which is a little heavier than Recoil. Iâ€™ve heard great things about Miss jessieâ€™s and Jessicurl products for wavy hair but havenâ€™t tried them yet. I really like using Herbal Essenceâ€™s mousses to add a little hold so my waves to go flat. You might look up and try the plopping or squish-to-condish methods, as those can be helpful to encourage waves. Diffusing helps encourage waves too, if you are okay with using heat. Thereâ€™s also nothing wrong with braid waves! So sometimes I just braid my hair after putting a little curl cream in it and it comes out lovely. Best of luck ðŸ˜ƒ"
