Samantharae667,g4dcrl,"Bounce curl help?&&&&&&I added a comment above. I also just really hate adding product to soaking wet hair. It‚Äôs uncomfortable and my curls really don‚Äôt bounce when I do that. I‚Äôve tried it a few times with no luck üòï but like I said, I gave up on bounce curl and like my curls better with the kinky curly line. It builds up on my ends really fast though, gotta wash it with shampoo every 3 days.&&&Am I doing something wrong? Here‚Äôs my routine. 

1. Cowash with moisture bounce curl conditioner
2. Apply the define cream to soaking wet hair, scrunch then used praying hands to add the gel to soaking wet hair. 
3. Scrunched with t-shirt 
4. Air dry. 

Curls are super soft and mushy, not forming clumps at all. My hair usually does well with protein. I‚Äôve tried countless products, but I feel like without a haircut and salon quality clarifying treatment, I‚Äôm doomed!&&&Thank you. I think I‚Äôm going to return it. If it doesn‚Äôt just work for 90$ it‚Äôs not worth it lol&&&Thank you! Yes, by scrunching I mean I scrunch with a towel gently after adding the curl cream. Then I use praying hands to add the gel and gently scrunch it in with my hands. I sent bounce curl back and used kinky curly, here is the result

Sharkelberryfinn,g4dcrl,"So you have a great curl pattern, but you are right, it's not really clumping. 

I'm not sure what you mean in 2 and 3 when you say you scrunch, but if you mean that you use your hand or a towel to squish your hair up towards your head numerous times or vigorously you should probably avoid that. Usually people will add product to sopping wet hair and ""plop"" it in a towel. You can Google technique,  but it involves gently laying the hair in a microfiber towel or tshirt and tying in up for 10-30 min (maybe this is what you're doing but you're calling it scrunching?)

Praying hands is good, you can also try the ""rope"" method.

Once the gel is in you can't touch your hair again until it is 100% dry. Once it is dry then you can scrunch out the crunch by breaking the hard gel cast to reveal the soft wave underneath.

Every time you touch your hair you disrupt a curl family, manipulate it as little as you can. 

Manes by Mel is really entertaining and has a lot of good YouTube videos on technique especially how to diffuse and use gel. 

Good luck Curlfriend!"
dazedg,g4dcrl,"The bounce curl gel is VERY concentrated so perhaps try putting a small amount in your palm, diluting it with water, and then applying and repeat a few times. If that doesn‚Äôt work, maybe try skipping the define cream and see how that turns out."
mpag119,g4dcrl,"I think you may have moisture overload, especially if you say that your curls are soft and mushy.  I would clarify with a sulfate shampoo or an ACV rinse, and do a protein treatment.  Rice water rinses are easy and cheap DIY protein treatments.

Co-washing is probably leading to moisture overload.  The define cream also seems like it is too heavy.  Have you tried their gel?"
ak2311,g3takk,"Is there actually a curl?&&&&&&So I stared the CGM a week ago. I ordered some products online but because of the Covid19 they aren't here yet. So I started with what I already had. I didn't even had a clarifying wash yet. For now, until my package arrives,  hopefully in the next couple of days, my hair routine looks like this: I wash my hair every 3-4 days, I conditioning them, once a week I deep conditioning,  I apply on wet hair a curl enhancing product,  I plop my hair in a tshirt for 30 minutes and I air dry my hair"
ell04,g3takk,"Do you mind sharing your hair routine, if you follow one? üôèüèª"
justtoclarafy-,g3takk,Definitely looks like you‚Äôve got some waves going on there! Keep us updated :)
opaul11,g3takk,It‚Äôs going for it! Congratulations!
professionalhippo1,g3takk,Looks like it is trying!! üëè
CorgoDestroyrOfWrlds,g3bv65,"How often do you clarify?&&&Most of the advice I‚Äôve heard is once a month but I‚Äôm less than 3 weeks into a modified cgm (no sulfates/silicones, trying out gel/mousse) and my hair is barely waving at all. When I first started I had much more visible waves so I‚Äôm wondering if my hair is being weighed down by the products I‚Äôve been trying. I have pretty thin hair, do I need clarify more often?"
LittleBit20,g3bv65,"I'm about the same as syd_ann96, though I learned that only very recently. With constant styling after a low-poo wash I find my hair getting build-up quite badly by the 2-week mark."
biscuitplz,g3bv65,"I clarify about every 4th-ish wash day. Sometimes I wait longer till I know I have time to do a deep treatment too. I do my darnedest to not do one without the other.

You're hair is still getting used to this method so definitely give yourself grace to break the rules. If you want to clarify, then go for it. Enjoy that reset button!"
crunchletsupreme,g3bv65,"Are you noticing more flakes in your hair or on your shoulders? Do you feel any discomfort at the scalp (dryness, itchiness, redness, soreness, inflamation)? If no, then the issue might not be clarifying. It could be what you suspect with products. Are you using different products right now compared to when you had more visible waves? Have you also maintained the same hair length & cut?

I went modified cgm (SLS and silicone free) spring 2018 and don't clarify routinely. I also don't cowash, I just do my routine every 3-4 days."
professionalhippo1,g3bv65,I started almost a month ago and figured I would do the once a month plan. I have since learned that My hair just can‚Äôt do that. I found out I have low porosity hair so product just sits in top rather than soaking in. I also have hard water. However I don‚Äôt want to just straight clarify once a week because I don‚Äôt always have time to deep condition. So now I am trying out mixing a tiny bit of hard water shampoo (ion brand from sallys) in with a cowash (as I am coconut cowash)to try to get a little clarifying action without completely stripping my hair. I am waiting to scrunch out my crunch now so I‚Äôll post an update when I see how it looks. If this works well I will alternate this cowash/hard water mix with a moisturizing lo poo until I get too much build up and then do a full clarifying shampoo and deep condition.&&&[here is my result ](https://img.makeupalley.com/4/4/3/7/3622836.jpeg) I will definitely try mixing the hard water shampoo with the cowash again. My hair looks a little stringy today but I am still pretty new to all this. All in all it‚Äôs one of my better wash days.
syd_ann96,g3bv65,"Personally I've found that I need to clarify every 2 weeks if I style my hair every wash/cowash. I also do modified curly girl method, if I don't style my hair often, I feel like I can get away with about 3 weeks. I do a deep conditioning protein treatment before washing and then I just use a light leave in to detangle."
Bleacherblonde,g3bn3f,"Kenra medium hold mousse. I have tried every curl cream and leave in conditioner, but they all weigh my hair down. But this mousse is amazing and doesn‚Äôt leave hair crunchy or heavy."
banana_kat,g3bn3f,For leave-in conditioner I like [Giovanni's Leave In Weightless Conditioner](https://giovannicosmetics.com/product/direct-leave-in-weightless-moisture-conditioner-curly-girl/)
dazedg,g3bn3f,"Lightweight product recommendations?&&&Hi! I have very fine and kind of thin long, 2a/b wavy hair. I‚Äôve been following the CGM (not super strictly) for about four years. I‚Äôve never been a product junkie, but as I near the end of my current product bottles, I‚Äôm thinking about trying some new ones. 

I‚Äôm on the hunt for some lightweight CGM approved shampoos, conditioners, leave-ins, and stylers (mousses, gels, creams, whatever). I‚Äôm hoping lighter weight products will help my hair hold its curl pattern and give it a tad more volume. 

I currently use Carols daughter shampoo (not sure if it‚Äôs CG), bounce curl cream conditioner, and either jessicurl spiralicious or bounce curl light cream gel. 

I‚Äôm open to all price ranges. Thanks!&&&Thanks! I‚Äôll look into its ingredients to see if I‚Äôm willing to give it a shot but sounds promising&&&Thanks!&&&Thank you!&&&Thanks I‚Äôll look into it!"
mercurys-daughter,g3bn3f,Cake curl whip
syd_ann96,g3bn3f,Mousse for sure! I use marc Anthony strictly curls styling foam. I don't believe it's CG approved but it works wonders on my fine hair.
tomanon69,g3bn3f,I really like LUS all in one curl cream. There shampoo/conditioner aren't worth the money imo.
HeavyDoubles,g39jn8,"Would NYM shampoo and conditioner be okay for someone with fine hair?

airavenue,g39jn8,"Your hair is so pretty and the curls look so good on you! My hair seems to be similar to yours‚Äîif you take night showers, how do you keep your curls in place until the next morning?"
dianacakes,g39jn8,I have a similar wave pattern and basically the exact same routine and I LOVE the NYM curl talk creme! I bought a second tube when I wasnt even half way done with the first because it worked so well in my hair.
happy_berry,g39jn8,"It looks like we have really similar hair types! I have a bit tighter curls on top and in the back, but then my under layers in the back are barely wavy. 

Also using Not Your Mother's. Haven't tried the cream yet though but I'm convinced! Your hair looks good and there's very little halo frizz (my current struggle)."
opaul11,g39jn8,So pretty
prettylady2208,g39jn8,"9 month process&&&9 month progress

Not your mother's curl talk line, shampoo and condition. Squish conditioner and leave it on until I clean my body. Squish some more. Apply nym curl talk creme dime size with praying hands. Use denman brush to brush hair to spread creme.  Add more water as needed.  Apply la looks extreme sports gel by scrunching it in. Apply some more on the back head.  Remove excess water with microfiber towel . Plop for 20 min. Diffuse by hovering over roots  with warm and for the strands use cool air.

https://i.imgur.com/TOiMpz0.jpg&&&Thanks! I hope you like the creme. My underlayers are less wavy that the front pieces too!&&&Thank you!!&&&I actually do this!! I diffuse and wait until completely dry and then pineapple. I don't scrutch until the morning!  This is actually  what I did last night!&&&I'm not sure but I think so, the conditioner is not as  moisturizing as others so it will not weight  down hair. The shampoo is good too. I think you might need to experiment with it to see if it would work."
Intelligentdrummer8,g38red,"Could my hair BE wavy?&&&&&&Hi guys! I'm so glad I found this reddit group. I always thought my hair was straight (even pin straight when I was a kid and treated it as such with dry brushing etc. It has been thin and dry for as long as I can remember but using more respectful hair products has done it a world of good. A  few months ago, I found out about the Cgm through a YouTube vid and learning about it thought that maybe my hair was not so dry and frizzy but it could be secretly wavy?!

I ve done three attempts at the Cgm but just by using clean shampoo, scrunching and plopping. My conditioner is not as clean as I thought so I stopped using it and I don t have any leave in or gel at home (except aloe but my hair visibly hates it!)

Here are some pics of the results I get so far, do you think I'm deluding myself into thinking it looks a bit wavy? I sleep with my hair twisted in a bun on the top with an invisibobble thingy, so maybe I'm just creating waves like one does by sleeping with a braid?&&&Thanks for your advice! it's quite weird cos one day my hair seems straight with just a bit of movement and the next it looks like a 2A.
I do agree if anything the cgm will make my hair look better, I learned it's high porosity and try to treat it accordingly. I ordered a conditioner and a leave-in from a brand that seems quite clean in my country, I will come back if/when I get more results :)"
LittleBit20,g38red,"You could have some waves in your hair. I see some gentle ones in the front! I'm not too sure if your hair in the back is a bit tangly from the bun you said you put it in or if those are just fluffy waves!

Even if your hair is mostly straight, some things in the cgm can be used for straight hair too. Its gentler, and helps any type of hair become healthier by taking out the silicones and sulfates!

I'd give it a go and see what it does for you! If anything, you'll have healthier hair at the end of it üòä 

If you are worried about spending a ton on products, don't be! There are cheap options out there! I'm currently using Not Your Mothers shampoo/conditioner (the blue bottles) and their Curl Talk Curl Defining Cream, the matching gel, and the refreshing foam. I got all of it for about $35 on Ulta. I think Herbal Essences has some good products too I have a mousse by them and it's pretty affordable!"
crispydetritus,g31pcf,Give flax seed get a try! My hair also has loose waves and it's fine so most products just weigh it down. Flax seed gel really encourages the wave pattern.
minimumanimal1,g31pcf,Tried amended CG method for wavy hair - Potential?&&&&&&Good tip! Will give it a go!
Previous-Ratio,g2owdl,"How to get started with caring for my hair?&&&I‚Äôm 19 years, and quite honestly I‚Äôve never really taken good care of my hair. My family buys shampoos and conditioners from VO5, White Rain, and Sauve. Sometimes I notice dandruff when I scratch my head. I have pretty wavy hair. It‚Äôs dirty blonde, but a few months ago I (temporarily) dyed my hair blue and there‚Äôs still a few streaks of blue that won‚Äôt come out from where I had gotten highlights about a year earlier. (That‚Äôs another problem entirely lol, tho if you have any advice for that as well hmu!)

I have an awful hairline. I can‚Äôt stand having my hair parted in any other way than in the middle, but my hair line is just so noticeable. My hair also gets really greasy the third day if I don‚Äôt shampoo and condition every other day. With quarantine going on, I haven‚Äôt been washing my hair as much so it has gotten greasier.

My sister says it looks like i have a bald spot in the upper back of my hair, but I know it‚Äôs from the hairline.

What type of products can I use to start taking care of it? What shampoos and conditioners should I switch to? I really can‚Äôt afford high priced products. I was looking at SunBum, but I don‚Äôt know, does anyone have any thoughts about their products? What should I do? I‚Äôm so very new to this.&&&thank you so much! I had no clue about any of that. I really appreciate this!"
lfoli72,g2owdl,"Hello fellow blonde wavy! Welcome to the club!

Don‚Äôt worry there are lots of affordable products out there and you don‚Äôt have to go too crazy with your routine. After experimenting for 3 years, my tips would be:

- find a sodium lauryl sulfate free shampoo. Lots of brands at Walmart, drugstore etc now have them.  A lot of wavy/ curly hair advice recommends only washing every 5-7 days.  But if your hair gets greasy then wash however much you need. A SLS free shampoo will help your hair and scalp retain natural oils and not get too dried out

- use generous amounts of conditioner when washing. Use a wide tooth comb to distribute it. Only partially wash it out, mainly around the roots of your hair leaving lots to soak in through the strand and to the ends

- only use a wide tooth comb when combing your hairs. Don‚Äôt brush. Please don‚Äôt brush your hair, just don‚Äôt. Trust me ;)

- try and find a hair refresh method that works for you. I shower at night so I need to refresh in the morning. Lately I‚Äôve been using a spray bottle mix of water and conditioner and that seems to be working for now

- have fun and don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment! My routine has evolved quite a bit over the past 3 years and yours will too!

Hope that helps and that you have many great hair days"

Suave Essentials Daily Clarifying Shampoo (about 1-2x a month max)

Jessicurl Gentle Lather Shampoo

Jessicurl Aloeba Daily Conditioner

Jessicurl Deep Conditioning Treatment (about 1-2x a month)

LOLARISX,g1r1ur,"It's a good start. Why complicate things. Lol. But if you do want to complicate things, I'd suggest to invest in a hair profile analysis.

I‚Äôll try the mousse/gel and leave in! Thanks again!&&&Normally I just shampoo/condition with regular stuff and let it air dry while I sleep. Sometimes I apply heat but since quarantine I just let it be. This is my hair after 3 days no washing.

I‚Äôve been researching all different products that have been mentioned in here and r/curlyhair. Not Your Mothers, Shea, OBX. It‚Äôs overwhelming! So many positives and negatives. I definitely want to try CGM approved product but ones that are geared to help more wavy specific hair.

trevorishy,g1r1ur,"Honestly your hair looks good and healthy already. If you want to try cgm, you can just scrunch in a mousse or a gel to encourage more waves. I dont really use any styling products myself during quarantine, but I do still use a leave in conditioner spray from NYM. It might be enough for your hair to control frizz and flyaways."
