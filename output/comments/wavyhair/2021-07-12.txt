Greatrisk,on5ifr,My under layers aren‚Äôt long enough to put up either so I pin curl them flat to my head to give them some shape. Helps quite a bit!&&&Happy birthday! You‚Äôre making me want to cut my hair‚Ä¶ üëÄ
Ham_Pie_,on5ifr,Damn your hair looks incredible!! Also this is totally the haircut I wanted when I went to the salon last week (not what I left with üò≠)
M30W-,on5ifr,Happy birthday!! Your waves üåä look amazing!
Sir3Kpet,on5ifr,Happy Birthday! Your hair more than cooperated!  Looks fantastic!
SlowSkyes,on5ifr,You are so beautiful!!! Your hair looks absolutely stunning!! I hope you had a wonderful birthday!!!
downy_huffer,on5ifr,"Your hair looks so cute!

My hair is a similar length.. Curious, what do you do with your hair overnight? I try to pineapple a bit with medusa clips but I can't clip the bottom half because it's too uncomfortable, so I just lie on it and it gets super flat underneath."
susscissors,on5ifr,"Got to see my friends for the first time in a while to celebrate my 21st, and my hair cooperated!&&&&&&thank you so much! ‚ò∫Ô∏è&&&I haven‚Äôt totally figured out how to get my hair to last more than a day yet unfortunately üò≠ I normally just sleep with a silk bonnet, and I just kinda shove all my hair into it because my hair is really too short to pineapple well. Sometimes it works, but usually if I want to be curly again, I have to completely wet my hair again in the shower/tub and reapply some products.&&&Hello! Routine is below :)

1. Washed and conditioned my hair with NYM Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water shampoo and conditioner
2. Detangled with a wide tooth comb, Squish-to-condish with the conditioner and water, and rinse
3. Applied Cantu Curl Activator and then Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Mousse with praying hands
4. Brushed hair and formed curl clumps with a knock-off denman brush, finger coiling, and then scrunching 
5. After all excess water was out of hair, I took a little bit the blue LA Looks gel and water and scrunched it into my hair
6. Scrunched hair with a microfiber towel, Diffused upside down until hair was mostly dry, and then let air dry with clips at the roots

I just got the ‚Äúknock off denman brush‚Äù from Ulta, (the brand is Pattern) and it worked so well! I believe my hair is low porosity and it is rather fine/sparse in some areas due to hair loss, and typically 2b-3a. Typing it all out makes it seem so long and complicated, but I think I‚Äôve finally found a routine that works! 
I apply all products (except for the mousse) with wet hands and then scrunch out the excess water/product so that my hair doesn‚Äôt get weighed down.&&&Thank you so much, I did! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è&&&I just recently got it trimmed, and it‚Äôs soooo nice having it a bit shorter with a few long layers!&&&thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ThorberryPie,on4rgr,"My hair seems really similar to yours. It gets overmoisturized REALLY easy and need lots of protein. I would recommend looking up overmoisturized hair to see if the description fits your case. If it does, don't worry about doing any deep conditioner at all.  Hell, I'm at the point of not using any rinse-out conditioner most days and my hair is happy about it. Bring on the clarifying shampoo and protein treatments."
amhause,on4rgr,I use the same shampoo & conditioner. Using a gel with protein made a difference for me. Bounce curl has a light gel with protein. But I really like something with a header hold‚Äîbiosilk rock hard gelee.
crunchletsupreme,on4rgr,"Your issue with buildup seems normal for low porosity hair, since products tend to sit on top of it. I checked the ingredients lists of your products to see if there were any issues with silicones/cleansing agents, but didn't notice any.

Next, I looked at the oils and butters in your products. The Jessicurl Aloeba conditioner says it has jojoba, coconut, and avocado oils. This product *might* be an issue if your hair is sensitive to coconut oil. It is one of those polarizing ingredients that people's hair tends to love or hate, even in a formulation with other ingredients.

The Jessicurl Too Shea deep conditioner might be your culprit. Shea butter is heavy, but current google search results seem to contradict older info recommending lighter butters/oils for low porosity hair such as this [2017 Naturally Curly blog post](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/butters/what-you-need-to-know-about-hair-butter-and-oils). If you're using it after your weekly clarify, the residue is still sitting on top of your hair all week until you clarify again. Butters in general may be too heavy for fine hair. I have fine medium porosity and my hair haaaaates shea butter lol.

Lastly, are you having any issues with moisture? If not then carry on. At minimum, applying the product when your hair is wet and warm should help the product penetrate the hair strand. I've come across sources recommending additional heat such as special shower caps for deep conditioning if you have lower porosity hair.

Edit: If you haven't seen this [Finally Amber](https://youtu.be/yWjKN2KRAj8) video before, then I highly recommend it. There was very scarce info on low porosity natural hair at the time, so her videos stood out to me. Keep in mind her tighter curl pattern so not everything may apply. For example, you already don't use a leave in conditioner as it's not necessary for most wavies.

Edit 2: idk what the itchy scalp implies, but you should first test whether any oils/butters or buildup were irritating your scalp. The Ion shampoo doesn't use SLS, but a milder version of it as the surfactant. Maybe you actually just need to use that one instead of Jessicurl? Slowly increase the clarification per week and see if that helps. As a fine haired wavy, you may be able to use any alternative SLS surfactant *daily*, this would require experimentation."
misslion,on4rgr,"2A/B, very fine, somewhat thin, low porosity hair. Having issues - what am I missing here?&&&Hi y'all! I've recently started with an actual concerted effort towards something resembling CGM, though it's loose. I've had some success over the past couple of days/week, but I'm trying to identify where my issues are coming from. 

Current routine:

Daily 

- wash with Jessicurl Gentle Lather Shampoo

- s2c with Jessicurl Aloeba Conditioner, leave for 3ish minutes and rinse

- apply Jessicurl Spiralicious to soaking wet hair and scrunch in

- scrunch some water out with microfiber towel and then pseudo plop (twistie turbie) for anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes

1x Per Week (Saturdays) 

- wash with Ion hard water shampoo

- condition with Jessicurl Too Shea!, leave in for 10ish minutes then rinse

- apply Jessicurl Spiralicious to soaking wet hair and scrunch in

- scrunch some water out with microfiber towel and then pseudo plop (twistie turbie) for anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes

I know shampooing every day is not CGM, but for me it's a very important component for my mental health so it's not really an option to skip days. 

[Here is](http://imgur.com/a/Wvuderb) my hair from last night, which was Saturday's routine. I'm pretty happy with this. But as the week goes on, when I get to Wednesday/Thursday/Friday, my hair will look greasy and weighed down with buildup even if I just shampoo and condition and don't use any styler. Once I use the Ion, that seems to go away. I also have itchy scalp, scalp acne (not new, but still active), and some maybe dandruff. Is the gentle lather shampoo just not cleansing enough for me? Are the oils in the Aloeba too heavy for my hair? I feel lost.&&&It's possible it's a bit over moisturized, but I'll be honest that I actually prefer the softer/looser waves to tighter ones so that's totally fine with me. I had serious protein overload a couple of months ago that made my hair very dry feeling and straw like, so I've probably swung a bit hard in the opposite direction.&&&I don't think my hair likes straight oils very much since it's low porosity - it feels like they have a tendency to just sit on top. Oil treatment before washing could potentially be an option that I'll definitely look into.&&&Seems entirely possible that the shea butter is the culprit, though I'll admit I find it a bit strange that it feels totally fine right after I use it but hair and products rarely make sense to me so maybe that's just how it is!&&&Yeah, I feel like I've had a lot of people basically act like I'm a failure for not being able/willing to skip shampooing every day. It's like the mantras for curly hair are so oft repeated that some people are unwilling to entertain the idea that they might not work for everyone.&&&My hair doesn't seem overmoisturized and I am somewhat certain it's sensitive to protein? I'll probably have to do some more experimenting there."
roundy_yums,on4rgr,"If it works better for you to clarify more than once a week, I say do it! Everybody‚Äôs hair is different. Do what makes yours feel good. 

You may be over-moisturizing too? Your hair is really pretty and shiny, but maybe a bit weighed down in the pic. Maybe experiment with some protein treatments and alternate deep conditioning with protein? Google ‚ÄúCGM protein‚Äù or look that up on YouTube and get some tips on how to tell if your hair likes protein. 

You might also check out some lighter conditioners and stylers, like mousse instead of gel. My hair‚Äôs texture is pretty different to yours, so I don‚Äôt know specific products, but maybe look for folks on YouTube who have similar hair and see what they say? Good luck!"
tonicspark,on4rgr,"I would think that since you're washing your hair every day you're causing irritation or you're not letting your scalp properly create oils. Could also have some sensitivity to your product ingredients. I have eczema, rosacea, and have a history of dermatitis so I have to really pay attention to ingredients. Since you said you can't stop washing every day try a lightweight oil like jojoba after you shower on your scalp to moisturize. It should help your scalp from producing excess oils. Or you could try a oil treatment before washing like jojoba, tea tree, olive oil etc. it helps me from being really itchy and flaking. Non aerosol dry shampoos also help keep oil production under control. Check out the ingredients in your products for any irritants, there's apps that can tell you more or someone on here might know a bit more about what you're using. I hope this helps you."
wandering_kath,on4rgr,"I can‚Äôt really help with routine (very new to wavy/curly hair myself!) but I just wanted to say I really appreciate that you mentioned washing your hair everyday is important to your mental health. I feel the same way and I‚Äôve been pretty amazed about how adamant people get about avoiding it. Not a lot of resources out there for us! But I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone and wanted you to know you aren‚Äôt either!! It might be more effort on the surface but for me the deeper effects make the difference.

Also I have zero idea if they‚Äôre CGM approved because I started using them pre-curly hair journey but Living Proof has a couple of scalp treatments that work great for my scalp (I‚Äôve always had an itchy scalp and their Dry Scalp Treatment changed the game this winter)."
ayychee,on2tgj,"1.5 months in, these happened with just scrunching&&&&&&This day I used Acure clarifying conditioner to brush tangles out, washed with Kinky Curly Come Clean, pulsed a little Curlsmith protein conditioner into my ends. Glazed Curlsmith souffl√© and a pea sized amount of Lush Power Curl cream emulsified in hands before glazing, scrunched, and wet plopped for 30. Scrunched in Aussie Instant Freeze and Pacifica Coco Gloss serum before hover diffusing."
Wavyhaircare,omyqaf,"The curl clumps closer to my face sometimes flip backwards pretty close to the root. I think it's due to styling upside down and leaning over more so than staying fully upside down. I can correct it if I think to adjust it after I flip upright but it doesn't bother me enough to bother with that extra step usually, haha."
blckrainbow,omyqaf,"It's either a cowlick type of thing where the hair wants to grow in the opposite direction, or could be new growth and your hair that is still almost intact (none or very little heat styling, chemical processing, maipulation, etc.) is actually a lot curlier than what you currently have."
camus-is-absurd,omyqaf,"Does anyone else‚Äôs hair ‚Äútwist‚Äù at the root?&&&I don‚Äôt know if this is a styling issue or an innate feature of my hair. My hair has pretty basic 2a waves all over it, but often the root of the wave clumps will twist or flip‚Äîalmost like a half a ringlet, right at the root. 

Is it due to plopping/washing upside down or is that just a wavy thing?&&&Thank you! They don‚Äôt bother me either but I did wonder if it was trying to do a little curl haha"
BlackWidow1990,omw2lb,"What is the best type of cut for wavy hair?&&&I‚Äôm getting a haircut next week and I‚Äôm just curious as to how I should get it cut to enhance my waves? I think I have 2b waves and my hair is fine. I‚Äôve read about long layers or ghost layers but honestly layered hair scared me because it‚Äôs so fine. Also, short hair is way too much maintenance for me.&&&I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you! I always thought short hair does way more damage than long hair. It‚Äôs always a constant fight with short hair trying to get everything to fall in place. I think my hair stylist knows what to do with wavy/curly hair - she is the one who encouraged me to stop straightening it!&&&I just worry about layers because I use to have layers and my hair got super super damaged but I was also heat styling daily back then so I do wonder if that‚Äôs why it got damaged. I don‚Äôt heat style anymore (thanks to quarantine lol)."
aquarianwitch777,omw2lb,"I have the same hair type very fine as well. I hated the thought of layers but once I got some they actually made a great difference in my hair just make sure to use your best hair cream/gel whatever styling product you use, otherwise my hair just goes limp and looks weird lol. But I‚Äôd suggest the layering it also helps my hair look thicker!"
muffunderstress,omw2lb,"Go to a hairdresser who knows how to cut hair. Since you have fine hair, look for a style that has minimal layering. It also depends on what you consider short and high maintenance. Personally, when my hair gets cut shorter it has always been the easiest to style because I use less product and my hair just benefits from a trim. Then again, I would discuss this with your hairdresser what you are comfortable with :)"
rdagz_,omw2lb,"I recently cut off quite a few inches, from my lower back to my collarbone. My hairdresser (who knows my hair) decided to cut my hair straight across. No layers, no individual curl cuts, just a straight blunt line. Now when I air dry my hair, it poofs out at the bottom and looks ridiculous. I have to blow it out to make it look somewhat decent. Def go to someone who knows how to cut curly/wavy hair."
yayomuse,omw2lb,My hairdresser did this too even tho I asked her not to and now the ends of my waves/curls are almost boxy shaped.
Packer43064,omtzh6,"Growing hair out, am I doomed with this hair sticking out like this until I get it cut again?

WeAreStarless,omtzh6,">will it just keep doing this at the end?

yes. it wants to be a full curl, but it's not long enough to be one yet, and so it just flips out like that"
jasminakarla,omtwjc,Really don‚Äôt think looks bad in the second picture at all! I mean your hair isn‚Äôt straight and sleek but that obv when it‚Äôs wavy. This amount doesn‚Äôt look messy or unprofessional though IMO
reddmead,omtwjc,"Ok this frizz situation is driving me slightly nuts&&&So I started attempting wavy girl method mainly to help reduce itchiness of scalp and trichotillomania (which it has!), but also to reduce frizz/poofiness (which has always bothered me) by encouraging curl pattern, which nothing I'm doing seems to really affect all that much. It might not look too horrible in the pictures, but it definitely looks at least 20% worse in real life.

This pic is before I tried anything wavy, and just washed with a combination shampoo+conditioner which is what I've been doing for the last decade or so.

In this one my hair is wavier (I guess it's hard to see cuz I cropped out the ends to emphasise the frizz), but still frizzy.

And you can even see with gel cast there's frizz. There's even frizz when I'm in the shower and my hair is wet.

&#x200B;

I feel like as far as frizz goes, at least when I brushed it straight, maybe it was poofy but at least it looked uniform???... I really prefer for my scalp's sake to continue doing the wavy girl method, but I worry it's making my hair appear messy and unprofessional.

The only thing I haven't done a tone of experimenting on is hair masks (but they're kind of a pain and I don't want to do them more than once a month unless I absolutely have to). I did an egg+coconut oil mask at the beginning of the month and it seemed to help a little, but only a little. And I conditioned with Garnier Fructis 1 Minute Mask for a few washes, but I noticed it makes my head itch, and have a lot of wet frizz, so I switched to Pacifica Pineapple Curls which seems better.

My routine is not super consistent yet, but basically I'm using Every Man Jack Citrus Shampoo+Conditioner as my shampoo (I know it is not the best, but I'm very hesitant to try anything else because I know this keeps my head from itching. I think maybe I can just use it less, and wash with water only on other days. So far this seems ok.), Pacifica Pineapple Curl Defining Conditioner as my wash-out, and then either flax seed gel, or the last wash I tried Lush Revive as a leave in instead (which actually gave me pretty good waves, which seems to mean a leave in is better than gel for me... the amount of wave seems directly corellated to how moisturized my hair is).

I don't know if my frizz is just inevitable (and maybe I should switch back to combing my hair out after showering?), if it's due to breakage and strain from my years of trichotillomania and I just need to wait for it to improve itself, or if there's something else I can do. But I really don't want to go nuts trying loads of different products, because I really want to keep things as simple as possible both ingredient-wise and number of products. For me it feels like a lot even just adding a conditioner after using just one hair product for a decade.

Edit: Also I have not tried sleeping on a satin pillow, but I laid on my friend's for like three or four hours while we were chatting and for some reason it made my hair really straight. I sleep on a cotton pillow and when I wake up, my hair is usually wavier than when I went to bed. It is usually wavier in the morning and then falls down throughout the day. Different friend with actual curly hair says she's never bothered with the satin stuff and never noticed any issues. I think my hair is generally strong and slick enough that I doubt my sleep gear is a primary issue.  


Edit, pics of hair fluffiness levels:

Two are older, and then the one in the middle is from this morning, where my hair was pretty max ... volume... but with waves. So just imagine that, but without waves, I guess?  


I was guessing that protein may be what I need, though I don't fully understand the concept of it. What type of stuff do you like to use for that and how often do you have to do it?&&&It is possible I am overthinking this, though it feels somewhat redundant since half the reason I was interested in the method was to try to reduce or get rid of the apperance of those stray hairs. But I did talk to my sister about it today, and she said it isn't that noticible. It's good to know it at least doesn't look like I recently crawled out of the woods lol. I guess I'm not sure what is ""normal"" or not."
tranquil_turtle,omtwjc,"How fluffy does your hair get? Whenever I have fluffy and really frizzy hair, like cotton candy, where no styling product seems to work I use a protein treatment and that always helps."

Aheathenconcievably,ompl3i,"I second this. I‚Äôve been using Mielle‚Äôs scalp oil for my telogeon effluvium and I‚Äôve seen great results. It‚Äôs probably a bit more costly than the homemade recipe that you recommended but it‚Äôs great in a time crunch.

Charmaine-Lim,ompk1n,"Tips for transitioning Asian wavy hair + product recs&&&Hello wavies üòäReally long post down below.

Brand new wavy here! Would love any advice/tips you have for transition Asian wavy hair. I just learned in April that my hair isn't straight. I always knew that my dad and sister have wavy hair, but I learned last month that my mom also has wavy hair. Since then, I've been working towards transitioning my hair and routine to see what waves I can bring out.

Background:Always had stereotypically straight Asian hair until I hit puberty. Then my hair got super frizzy and thick. My mom said it was because I permed my hair when I was 8, but all the damage had grown out and been cut off by the time I hit puberty (my hair grows very quickly). What proceeded were several really bad layered cuts and thinning, all of which made me look more like an unintentional 2000s emo girl. I then started braiding it constantly to keep it in check and give me waves because I've always desperately wanted wavy/curly hair.

I've bleached my hair three times and had it rebonded twice. Other than that, it's mostly just been growing longer with an annual cut. My hair always dried straight but held great curl out of braids. Then it would puff immensely in humidity (I sometimes call myself Hagrid because of the frizz) and get really unmanageable. It's always felt pretty dry, even though I never use heat on it. Only in the past three years has it really begun to soften more because I've taken conditioning really seriously.

Starting in April, I wondered if there was a chance that I could have wavy hair and started looking into CGM. I was convinced enough that I should try scrunching without product to see if my hair had any natural wave and it did. It has been a couple months of educating myself through YouTube (Manes By Mell, Swavy Curly Courtney, India Batson, Ayesha Malik) and figuring out if I want to go full CGM or still use the occasional silicone depending on what products are available around me.

Now:So now I'm in transition. Officially began on June 25th and I'm trying to build a CGM-friendly routine with products that can be found in Singapore. I know that Hask has a decent range to be found here and I'm using both CurlScan and IsItCG websites to check brands and ingredients. Still, it would be nice if any fellow Asian waives have tips on how to transition and what products have worked.

I'm also looking for a good hair dryer and diffuser because I think it'll make a huge difference as I transition. My hair is really long and heavy, so the water weight pulls my waves out over time and it currently takes around 6 hours to fully air dry. I've been trying the pineappling method when I sleep, but I think I need to dry plop instead because my hair is too long for the pineapple to work really well.

A good hairdresser who knows how to work to wavy hair would also be nice because I fear going to a salon and having them blowdry my hair. I'm not exactly looking for someone who knows how to dry cut or do wavy cuts (my hair hates being layered), but someone who will understand wanting both length and natural waves.

Products:I'm currently using the Kristin Ess Curl Shampoo and Conditioner because I stocked up before moving back. The Shea Moisture Manuka Honey Deep Conditioner is also in my shower, although the honey seems to be attracting more frizz from the humidity. And I'm trying to figure out how to best use the Shea Moisture Coconut & Hibiscus Curl Cream without causing flash drying. My gel is not CGM approved but it's all I have for now, so I'm sticking with it until I can find something else.

Routine:I wash my hair, squish to condish & wrap it up for extra conditioning time, rinse, scrunch loosely until enough water has come out and then plop with a cotton shirt for 20 mins, add water before using gel in prayer hands and scrunching, and leave it to air dry.

TL;DR - Newbie Asian wavy looking for CGM friendly products available in Singapore & advice on how to transition lower porosity, coarse Asian hair.

Whew, that was really long. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read all of that. It's my first time posting to any subreddit and I feel kind of nervous asking for all this advice üòÖ

Thank you all in advance!

I‚Äôve heard a few people talk about it and I might look it more now&&&Oh I have seen a few people talk about Hera before. I‚Äôll have to look into it üòä As for wavy/curly products, I‚Äôve kind of come to terms with needing to use websites like iHerb and LookFantastic. I haven‚Äôt ordered anything yet, but I‚Äôll make another post when I do. There‚Äôs another website I‚Äôve found that has a ton of CGM-safe products, although I‚Äôm not clear on whether they ship to Singapore. Could be worth checking out though. It‚Äôs CurlShops.com."
ishappinessascam,ompk1n,"In the same boat as you and would love to get some recommendations too! Unfortunately I'm still struggling to find products and build a routine but for the hair salon you could maybe try Hera. Do let me know if you manage to find suitable products/have any wavy girl recommendations, would love to have input from someone else staying in Singapore :)"
michiaball,ompk1n,"Just wanted to say welcome to the club, fellow asian wavie! :)"
reddmead,ompk1n,"Ok, so I started around the same time you did, so I'm not sure my advice is going to be that helpful, but I'm happy to see another Asian hair thread, and it looks like your hair is similar texture to mine, though mine is layered and not as long.

You're right that it will probably wave mostly at the ends due to weight, since my sister who has hair closer to yours says this also seems to be the case for her when she goes to sleep with wet hair.

I'm not totally certain of my conclusions so far, and I'm still experimenting, but there's a couple of unexpected things that seem to be true. One is that I think my hair needs a leave in conditioner more than it needs a gel (and using both at the same time makes the waves straighter), even though the reverse is the case for Emily who write the WavyHairCare blog. But if you want to use a clean gel, if you can get flax seed, you can just boil some of that in water until it thickens, strain out the seeds, and frankly that works pretty well. (You might even be able to use chia seeds, if that's easier to find where you are?)

Another is that I actually think maybe I could sometimes wash my hair without any products at all. For a little bit I've been trying with some limited products to go for a shampoo with less sulfates, but it seems like the sulfate itself helps my scalp itch less (this is a primary goal for me doing cgm) probably because it washes out whatever other stuff is in the shampoo that bothers me. So the other day, since my head didn't feel that dirty, I figured I'd just scrub with water, and that actually seemed to work fine. I don't put the conditioner too close to my roots.

I am not sure yet but I feel like I can get away with sub-par or no shampoo, and decent, but not necessarily perfect wash out conditioner. The leave in stuff afterwards seems to make the biggest difference. I have done a little experimenting with hair masks, but not enough to have an opinion about them except that they do seem a bit helpful.

Also, I should add that I'm in North America near the US/Canada border, so there's some climate difference that may effect things."
Pouriaa,ommcdg,"Any tips for my hair and frizz? It's curlier when wet but when it dries it's like this. This is day 2 hair.&&&&&&Routine: wash with garnier hair food banana shampoo and comb with conditioner, after shower apply john frieda frizz ease gel and scrunch, plop for 10 min, apply john frieda frizz ease mousse&&&Thank you"
Rapunzel_Shepard,ommcdg,"I have had the same issue, what helped me (besides geting shorter hair) was using lighter products without or with less heavy oils. 

Garnier Fructis Hairfood Banana might be too heavy for your hair. (It was to mine)

I do not know what your gel contains, but try to test to avoid styling products with (alot) of shea butter, coconut oil and so on."

Wash and scrub head with shampoo brush- local sulphate free shampoo. Wide tooth comb, condition (local silicone free conditioner) wet brush the clumps to spread product, squish to condish (a bit confused). Wash out conditioner, praying hands a bit of Camille Rose Coconut leave-in and scrunch.

Praying hands Cantu curl activator gel (emulsified the gel first), scrunch, micro plop, air dry. Scrunch out crunch possibly with a light vitamin E oil. 


Next I want to try leave in-mousse-gel after I do deep conditioning and a clarifying wash.

For now I struggle with curl consistency and a lot of frizz (not sure if humidity or what). Day 57 was ‚Äúday 2 hair‚Äù in my washing cycle."

Ladymistery,omj8fp,"Depends on how cheap.

there's an herbal essences set that is about $8 per bottle - it's not bad.

I buy mine from Sally Beauty, Ion brand colour safe sulfate free conditioner/shampoo - it's pricey up front, but it lasts a while."

3dant3,omiax1,"What is my hair type? And how do you deal with frizz when you get sweaty/it‚Äôs hot outside or when refreshing?&&&&&&Thanks! I‚Äôll try that&&& I tried to refresh today after having a good wash day yesterday, but couldn‚Äôt stand the smell of the garnier fructis curl renew spray, and had to rewash today. It looked good after scrunching out the crunch, and was still really wavy after a long sweaty walk outside (but more frizzy). I always knew my hair had some waves, but not ones I ever thought looked nice (I always brushed it out both wet and dry and typically always have it up in a ponytail), except for when I‚Äôd get ringlets around my face after being outside in a drizzling rain, etc. I never realized I had actual wavy hair before. So now I‚Äôm mostly trying to figure out what grade it looks like, and curious because after the sweaty walk it seemed to get more ringlet-y (in addition to a bit more frizzy).&&&Thanks! I guess what I meant to say was curl type/grade, not hair type.&&&Today I washed with aveeno clarifying shampoo, used a suave conditioner, scrunched in some Aussie gel  and some curl cream while hair was wet, plopped for about 20 min, then used some herbal essences totally twisted mousse. I diffused a bit to get it to not be sopping wet, then air dried."
Automatic_Net_5107,omiax1,"One of my favorite gels (which is more like a serum) is Ouidad Heat and Humidity Gel. I used it on a day that I spent all day outside in 90 degree heat, high humidity and my curly waves held up SO well!! Would reccomend üëåüèª"
Sigmund_Six,omiax1,"Hmm. I like the other suggestion about adding a light hold mousse. Otherwise, after I wash, I use a lot of really high gold gel (the LA Looks blue version) and am careful not to scrunch out as much of the crunch in the summer months. I need some of that hold to fight the humidity. 

I also have luck rewetting my hair to reactivate some of the cast, but that only works if I‚Äôve put in enough gel after the wash (like I said, I have to use a lot of it. I‚Äôd guess maybe half a palmful on each side of my head, maybe more.)"
allu-jallu,omiax1,"I tap with Cantu wave mousse after scrunching out the crunch and then don't touch it (don't even remove the excess foam just let it settle) it puts a very light cast over the hair and keeps it more defined, the hold is very soft so no scrunching needed. You might wanna try it. If that doesn't help, you can add a small amount of Cake wave mousse on top of Cantu but be cautious because this one has a strong hold and will form a crunch if used in high quantities.

Edit: I have never tried using your mousse but maybe you could try applying it like I described, after the drying and SOC."
caffein8dnotopi8d,omiax1,i have tried so many other gels but the LA looks one is truly the best i‚Äôve found. i think i might have to go back to that.
neverseektotell,omiax1,Diffuse to about 80% wet then add a very thin coat of gel again and finish drying
rapunzlvr,omiax1,"Not sure of the hair type, but you have beautiful long waves!!"
talks-like-juneee,omiax1,"For the frizz, once you‚Äôre done styling, use a smoothing product. I use BEDHEAD after-the-party smoothing cream and it works well :) but there are many kinds. Been on this sub for awhile now and seems like frizz with wavy hair is just inevitable so we use product to combat it."
