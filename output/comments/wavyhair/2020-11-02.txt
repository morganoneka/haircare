ToTheRiverWeRide,jqqspv,"I woke up to a few serious spirals after pineapple + sleeping scarf wrap! Highly recommend for an automatic refresh.&&&&&&My routine seems to change every time I wash. This time:

Shampoo with Living Proof Restore shampoo

Let Kevin Murphy BLONDE.ANGEL treatment sit in for a couple of minutes, then S2C with Kevin Murphy HYDRATE-ME.RINSE.

Rinse out conditioner upside down while brushing out completely. While sopping wet, scrunch in asiam leave-in conditioner. 

Then glaze + prayer hands + scrunch Tresseme  Tres Gel (extra firm control). 

Plop for 15 min and air dry, SOTC without product (I wasn‚Äôt home so i didn‚Äôt have any). This gel cast and wet plop weren‚Äôt very successful at controlling the frizz this time around.

Last night i put my hair in a pineapple and plopped it in a scarf which i wrapped around my head. It‚Äôs silk but rough, I‚Äôm getting a satin sleep cap to replace it. This overnight plop makes my waves super bouncy, even on days 3-4. It is the ultimate refresh method for my hair."
CH705-807,jqq545,Please save some boys for the rest of us!
Flayrah4Life,jqq545,Your hair is lovely!
MacKenzie-Hollister,jqq545,how on earth do you get that SHINE!! your hair is stunning omg
Madeitforthethread,jqq545,"Holy crap, I dream of hair this perfectly smooth and shiny. My hair loves to be dry and greasy at the same time(???)"
SweetTruskawka,jqq545,"You look so pretty, I dream of hair like this ‚ù§"
amooni95,jqq545,I'm interested in seeing a photo of your hair prior to the haircut
builtthiscityon,jqq545,How much mousse do you use for your whole head approximately?&&&Damn that‚Äôs the least frizz I‚Äôve ever seen. Kudos
ndhewitt1,jqq545,Mine also loves to be dry and greasy! Hahaha!&&&This looks so great! So are these pictures with that routine? You have mousse in that you‚Äôve scrunched? Do you know your hair type? Curious because I think I like this look more than the very wet set look I‚Äôve been doing.
pulang_panda,jqq545,"My 1c bottom layer and 2a crown cooperate with each other, finally!&&&&&&Thank you!! That's a tough combo. Before I stopped conditioning regularly, my hair was chronically limp and sticky, no matter how much protein filler I added to my leave in... Sounds like the opposite of your problem, hahaha. Good luck finding a solution! This stuff is complicated üòÇ&&&I'll try to find one :) I used to just brush it out to be uniform, so it's hard to find any accurate photos of my atrocious mixed textures lol!&&&I've been wrestling with my inconsistent texture for months. I got my first proper haircut in 2+ years yesterday, and my stylist blended everything so perfectly!!

ROUTINE

Shampoo with Live Clean Rebalancing Shampoo; spot detangle with an emulsifed, penny-sized dollop of Live Clean Rebalancing Conditioner, rinse immediately with cool water; gently shake head to form clumps; blot excess water with microfiber towel; spritz with DIY sea spray; scrunch in enough Herbal Essences Totally Twisted mousse to form a cast; diffuse; SOTC with a drop of jojoba oil&&&Thank you kindly! In my case, less turned out to be WAY more in terms of styling. I hope you find your dream routine soon!&&&Hahaha, you're too kind!! üòÇ&&&It released A Lot of weight! My bottom layer looked stick straight, and now it holds a slight bend even without product. They're still not uniform but at least they look like they belong on the same head! I asked my stylist to give my hair more movement and texture so the straight parts don't just hang there, limpness emphasized by the waves up top.&&&Thank you! It's been a challenge to balance it!&&&Thank you! There's a tiny bit of Argan Oil in my diy sea spray‚ÄîI think it's what keeps my hair looking shiny despite all the stuff in it!&&&Yup, this is the routine! There's a Lot of mousse in here, three baseballs all applied from the ears down lol. My hair details are: Fine, medium porosity (I dyed it back brown after clumsily box bleaching a few years ago), dense"
radbabbit,jqq545,It looks so great! Also curious what kind of difference the cut made :)
Wavyhaircare,jqpwi4,"Poof is usually brushed out waves so my guess is that you have wavy hair. You can try to scrunch your hair while in the shower. If it gets wavy/curly looking when wet, apply some gel or mousse and let it dry and that's sort of a quick 'test' if your hair is wavy or not. You don't have to buy curly girl approved products just use whatever you have on hand, if your hair is wavy it should look more wavy after doing that."
wavyornot,jqpwi4,"I always thought my hair was straight but weird - is it actually wavy?&&&&#x200B;

Looking back at pictures of my long hair I notice that it was dry, frizzy.

I asked a hair dresser once how to get sleek smooth hair and she said I would have to straighten it. I tried once and it was such a pain because my hair is so thick I quickly decided I didn't mind having slightly poofy hair. üòÜ

I learned to appreciate the body in my hair, but have always considered it straight. I was browsing the curly girl method and started to wonder if I might have wavy hair. It's at least 1c. But maybe even 2a???

Right now my hair is a pixie cut, and I love it, but if I could have waves I might even want to grow it out - at least to find out, haha.

What do you think? Do you think I have waves or am I fooling myself? Lol

Maybe my hair is too short to see the wave pattern yet."
Wavyhaircare,jqnap8,"I work from home and don't usually do anything on non-wash days. If I have somewhere to go and my hair fell apart particularly bad I will, but that isn't very often. I don't think there is anything 'bad' about just leaving your hair be between wash days. I think refreshing is more about maintaining the look you want. I don't think it makes your hair healthier or that sort of a thing, if that is your concern."
dinosaurholiday,jqnap8,"Non wash day&&&I have been washing my hair about twice per week for the past year. On the days i don't wash it, I don't even wet it in the shower, brush it, or anything. Obviously it is just ok on those days, but who is leaving the house? Should I be wetting, conditioning, and styling on non wash days?&&&That might be worth a try for me.&&&Regimen: not cg. Just person who doesn't feel like washing and styling hair. L'oreal shampoo/conditioner, benign neglect."
kp389,jqnap8,"My hair is really fine so I can't apply extra product on non-wash days. I just went my hands and ""squeeze"" my waves (not scrunch, which breaks them up). It reactivates my gel, so after it dries, I scrunch it out again and go."
thefisthat,jqnap8,how do you squeeze them?
CulturalJob8913,jqhr8f,It looks like your hair waves in the front about mid-way and then loses definition and curl. Looks like heat and maybe highlight/color damage. Just a note - my hair poufs like that with aloe but since the back looks good that‚Äôs probably not it.
crazeenurse,jqhr8f,Y‚Äôall what is happening in the front there?&&&&&&I will give it a try thanks!&&&Tresemme botanique shampoo and conditioner. Uncle funny‚Äôs daughter curl stimulator on soaking wet hair. La Bella gel after tshirt plop for twenty minutes. Pixie diffused then air dry the rest. Some garnish smoothing cream to smooth some frizz.&&&I for sure agree with damage. I just cut off a few inches and see my waves better in the back. Any idea what to do about the front besides let it grow?
kp389,jqhr8f,"The front of my hair is color treated and doesn't curl easily. After I plop, I apply a tiny bit more gel to that area. Might help?"
Manlytea,jqf2o6,"Do you ever have wash days when you just can't do the full routine?&&&Hey guys, I'm only three weeks in to a slightly modified cgm but I've had a really long day and I'm exhausted. üò© Kinda just wanna get it washed and detangled and conditioned and just skip the gel and diffusing. Is that gonna leave me waveless until my next wash day or will refreshing still work? It just takes so long to dry with gel in. 

I normally cowash and condition with faith in nature lavender conditioner, just started trying curl training, s2c, microplop, cantu curl cream and eco olive oil gel, plop while I get dry and dressed then diffuse to about 80-90% dry and let the rest air dry before sleeping in the cast in a pineapple and scarf. Also do a low poo wash with Johnson's lavender baby shampoo then a deep condition with a Vatika egg protein mask every third wash day.&&&Amazing! I'll look into that. Make me feel much less like a quitter üòÇ"
Wavyhaircare,jqf2o6,"I haven't tried to style later but I occasionally have washdays where I need to wash but don't have the emotional energy to care to diffuse for an hour (Which my hair needs if I use product) so I just shampoo, condition and say screw it until the next wash day. If I'm battling depression or something, sometimes I just prefer to take that hour to do something else and I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Who says you have to always style your hair, you know?"
WeAreStarless,jqf2o6,"that sounds like the [wash now, style later](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/washnowstylelater/) method!"
majorbleepbleep,jqf2o6,"I get much better results with wash now/style later.  I pretty much only do it this way now. I have lower back length hair. Medium porosity, fine but thick hair. Maybe 2b with some 2c mixed in there.  I shampoo (nym tahitian), then condition (nym tahitian) and get the absolute best clumps when i use that same conditioner as my leave in as well.   Then I plop for a bit, usually 20ish minutes and then take it out and just go to bed.  Sometimes, not gonna lie, im exhausted, and fall asleep in the plop.   Next morning, im usually completely dry and I spritz my hair until dripping wet. I then add more of my nym tahitian conditioner and brush thru with my denman type brush..  Do my scrunches.  Mousse, gel, mousse. With scrunches in between. Then diffuse or air dry.    The extra conditioner  makes amazing clumps and the mousse/gel/mousse approach give staying power that often times keep my waves going in to the next day.  If not, I really only have to add a little water for the next few morning  because the product in my hair seems to rejuvenate itself without getting sticky so I dont really feel like I'm needing to wash my hair again."
EnterTheDarkForest,jqckke,"Waves Cooperated for Graduation Photos!&&&&&&My routine:
Shampoo with Giovanni Tea Tree Tingle shampoo or Jessicurl gentle lather shampoo (this wash day I used both since I wanted my scalp extra clarified)
Condition with Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner and STC. 
Comb through Not Your Mothers Curl Cream, STC. Glaze Giovanni LA Gel over hair, STC.
Apply golf ball size dollop of Herbal Essences Totally Twisted mousse. 
Scrunch like my life depends on it. 
Wet plop for 15 minutes, then micro plop to partially dry hair. 
Air dry since diffusing makes my hair frizzy. 
SOTC with Alikay Naturals Lemongrass Leave-in. 

This is my all out wash day for when my hair needs to look good.&&&Thank you so much!"
pouruppasta,jqckke,Congratulations on your masters! And good hair day!
RadishDerp,jq67pv,"Proud of how far I've come! 1 year 3 months modified CG!&&&&&&I'm not a strict CG method rule follower, so I realize some of the products I use aren't CG approved! 

-cake curl next door shampoo, lather on scalp only and use shampoo brush to really make sure my scalp is clean 

-cake curl girl conditioner, spread throughout hair and detangle with a wide toothed comb. Let sit while I do my other shower stuff, then add water and squish to condish 

- rinse out excess conditioner (I leave in 20%) and then leave the shower 

-rake in cake curl cream throughout hair (maybe a quarter sized amount for each side of my head). 

-section hair into top and bottom, and use denman brush on each section, add water as needed for optimal clumpiness (usually dripping wet for me) and scrunch. Finger coil any bits that are flat or stringy. I also made sure to finger coil areas on top of my head and around my face since that's what people see first. 

-glaze over each section and scrunch in Aussie volume gel 

-micro plop with t shirt 

-hover and pixie diffuse until I get bored 

- air dry the rest of the way 

-SOTC!"
findomblu,jq1o41,"Recently started my journey with what i think is wavy hair. Anyone know if i‚Äôll eventually get more defined waves? (if these are even waves). I recently incorporated protein and it seems they‚Äôve become more flat ):&&&&&&i‚Äôve been trying different methods. Here i decided to plop it and used shea moisture curling gel, shea curl enhancing smoothie, and l‚Äôor√©al elvive protein recharge. I read somewhere protein should enhance them but for me it seems to be doing the opposite."
kbneuro,jq1o41,(I'm super new to cgm so don't take my word for it but) its possible you have too much protein and are overloading your hair with it if they are getting flatter with it. Whens the last time you clarified your hair? Sometimes doing that helps reset your hair as well
technoglobe,jq1o41,"I have very similar waves. I have no advice, but I‚Äôm interested to hear what others say. I have the same question."
Discbound,jpzo24,Mousse? I find that works well for me
chikoritaaaaaaa,jpzo24,NYM Curl Talk Mousse is amazing
zoomzoomresume,jpzo24,"Products for people that don‚Äôt want a gel cast&&&Here‚Äôs my current routine: Maui Moisture Watermelon Shampoo & Conditioner, Cake Curl creme, Aussie freeze gel. My hair is sticky, ratty, and dull looking when I use these products. The gel cast either never fully dries or when it does dry, leaves my dry hair sticky. I‚Äôve found the best hair days I have are when I use no gel or curl specific products - just a leave in and oil. I don‚Äôt mind the slight frizz I get. 

I have thick hair that takes forever to dry. Any product recommendations for wavy hair that needs moisture but no gel??"
Flayrah4Life,jpz0st,"You have the perfect hair, the exact look I'm going for!"
beezlebruh,jpz0st,"This is my best hair day so far! My waves are finally starting to become more defined, and I couldn't be happier.&&&&&&I follow the cgm method pretty strictly. My routine is to co-wash with Mane 'n Tail, then once that is fully rinsed out, I apply a gratuitous amount of Garnier Fructis Nourishing Hair Treat 1 Minute Mask. I let that sit in my hair in a clip for about 5-10 minutes while I do the rest of my shower things, then I detangle my hair with my fingers under the running water. I then flip my hair upside down and s2c the conditioner/water mix into my hair, adding more of the hair treat if I feel I need to. Once I wash it out COMPLETELY (leaving any in weighs my hair down and makes it look oily) I use a microfiber towel to squish out some of the water, then apply KMS curl up bounce back spray, putting some in my hands and squishing it into my damp hair. I then plop for about 30 minutes, then I air dry the rest of the way. I do this about twice a week, and I just tie my hair up with a silk scrunchie on the other days that I shower.&&&Ahh that's so nice! I've always been frustrated with it, so that's such a huge compliment! Thank you!&&&Wow thank you! That's so nice!&&&Oh what?! That's news to me! Thanks for letting me know, I'll look into that! I'm extra glad I posted now lol&&&Thank you sm!&&&Thanks so much (:"

kissmyastro95,jpxoom,"First post! After a life of straightening and damaging my hair to do what I want it to, I am 4 months into my natural reset journey and I'm finally feeling like I understand what my hair needsüíö&&&&&&ROUTINE:

It's very sporadic, but here's my product list:
 
Shea Moisture Curl & Shine shampoo on roots only, every 3 washes (once per week, usually)

Shea moisture Daily Hydration Conditioner in giant globs roped through my hair (concentrated on my ends bc they're dead af) and then plopped on top of my hair for several minutes while I shower - then I rinse only about 80% of it out before scrunching with a little tiny extra squirt in my hands and rubbed together. 

Then I plop with 100% cotton.

Currently, when I'm ready to style, I use a handful of Got2Be Twisted Air Dry Foam scrunched in while it's still wet. 

If it's frizzy (which it always is lol) I spray on some Creme of Nature Argan Oil Strength & Shine Leave-in Conditioner Spray and scrunch with that."
