TifJD,c31rvz,Beautiful! What's your routine?
coolerversionofmyslf,c31rvz,"3 months in and loving it!&&&&&&Thank you!!


Wash with NYM curl talk shampoo,
Condition and squish in Shea Moisture  and Tame conditioner, rinse completely,
Squeeze out water with microfiber towel,
Wrap hair in turban for 10-20 minutes,
Apply Devacurl Wavemaker (TOTAL GAME CHANGER FOR ME) with praying hands and scrunch in,
Diffuse until 100%,
Fluff, fluff, fluff

Next time i will try using my LA Looks Gel with Wavemaker, but this was my first time trying it so i wanted to see how it performs on its own.&&&I'm not sure why I can't see all of your last comment, but I can't recommend Wavemaker enough, though it is expensive, it really does work wonders."
Aretha,c2aclo,"[here](https://imgur.com/a/t7DdOSF)  are a few pics of my fine waves&&&Lus brand shampoo conditioner and leave in product (wavy formula)

Shampoo as usual, condition stays in for 5 minutes, I finger comb my hair and let it sit 

Cool rinse out the conditioner 

Do not brush hair!

Add leave in product to sopping wet hair (watch tutorials on the lus website) 

Plop for 5-15 minutes 

Air dry or diffuse on low heat Low air. Do not brush do not finger comb do not barely even touch until it’s bone dry 

Once bone dry, massage the scalp to break things up a bit and floof out some volume 

Lus products smell great and are cg approved"
Lucylv35,c2aclo,I have straight hairs so I really love the curl ones. You can curl them properly with some hot [irons](https://www.hellojinri.com). As you have short hairs this will perfectly suit you & you can try some hairbands which will look cute on you.
myluckyshirt,c2aclo,"Ooooh looks like we have the same hair. I’m always looking for suggestions too. I currently use Aussie gel and conditioner. Suave coconut conditioner when I co-wash.  Shae moisture shampoo. 
I blow dry straight a few days a week.  Sometimes diffuse with the aussie gel.   
When I have a lot of time I let it dry in bigger chunks, the waves turn out better. But that usually takes more work in the shower. Parting my hair. Squish to condish. Twist a few pieces for definition. 
Sometimes it’s just not worth the effort! My second day hair is never worthwhile. Silk pillow case. Pineapple whatever. Doesn’t help!"
nemtudod,c2aclo,"Very fine, wavy hair suggestions welcome&&&&&&Yepp. Same here. 
I also read about leaving water in is apparently (according to some theories) NOT good, and that’s why those expensive towels exist that remove moisture from wavy hair, because too much moisture is damaging, no idea what to beleive any more.&&&Routine and product suggestions please!&&&Interesting. I noticed if i dont finger comb or brush the ends just stick together (like velcro)"
trick-james,c2aclo,"I'm so glad you use Lus. I've been trying to decide if it was worth a try. I've been reading reviews for like month. Do you have to use the shampoo and conditioner, or will the product stand on its own?"
