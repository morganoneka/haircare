theoracleofdreams,q5iwfv,"The best wash day so far!!&&&&&&Pre treated my hair with Ion Keratin Dry oil mist to dry hair, brushed to distribute. Left in approximately an hour due to my dog getting sick on the floor.

Got into shower and wet my hair and applied Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist for 3 min.

Then shampooed with Monday Volume to get the silicone in both products out.

Followed up with Garnier Damage Repairing Treat Conditioner, left in hair 5 minutes and rinsed in cold water.

Plopped for 10 min.

Applied Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave, Pantene Curl Defining Mousse, and brushed my hair through, focusing on my roots, scrunched and applied Aussie Instant Freeze Gel by scrunching.

Hover diffused till roots were somewhat dry alternating sides and upside down on high/high heat, and spot diffused on low/warm.

Once dry. I clapped out the cast.

Now I hope they don't go flat in the bonnet over night lol"

Snowstig,q5gmom,"New AG Curl Fresh Defining Cream is not messing around!&&&&&&For this wash day, I clarified, did an ACV rinse, and then used a deep conditioning/protein mask.  Then I applied the new AG Curl Fresh Defining Cream (that I saw Manes by Mell and her seester Amanda and u/JordanFaith use in this week's YouTube videos) in the shower using praying hands, then scrunched.  Plopped for 5 minutes, then microplopped.  Hover/pixie diffused upside down for 10 minutes, then flipped right side up and hover/pixie diffused for another 10-15 minutes (medium heat, medium speed).

awful_falafels,q5e25p,"Hey OP your hair is my ultimate goal! I already have a very similar curl/wave pattern to what you have, so I'm hoping you can help answer a couple of questions for me!

Could you point me to any links or videos that you used when learning to cut your hair this way? I've wanted a shag for so long but there aren't any curly salons around me (I'm very rural) and bed to do something with my mop. It's well post due for a cut.

Second question, how many days does your hair last between washes with just the curl custard? I typically refresh by spritzing water and scrunching with my hands or using the diffuser real fast to revive my waves and curls, but can go 4 days without washing (I'm a mom of 3 kids under 5 so I'm also about low maintenance and easy). Thanks in advance for your help!"
bigsbell,q5e25p,"embrace the poof&&&&&&Sometimes I feel so bogged down trying to follow CGM properly and get the tightest curls, and the best cast etc. Today I decided to take it easy. Shampoo and conditioner, a bit of shea moisture curl custard in wet hair, plopped and diffused and I'm stoked with the results. Recently cut my hair into a shag and have been toying with how to style it. This wash has been the best wash and it was all about embracing the frizz and poof to give me the volume I wanted. I'm just relieved and relaxed and excited about my hair again and that's a nice change.

I cut my hair myself with a razor because I like the freedom but I was trying to go for a shag ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ hahah it's tons and tons of layers and not in even levels, you kind of cut curl by curl so see where it falls.

I misspoke above, it's actually the ""curl enhancing smoothie"", and I'll layer sometimes with the kinky curly curling custard for more hold&&&Haha thank youuuuu&&&Aww that means extra because I DIY'd it ü§¶ thank you! haha&&&Great tip!&&&Hey! For this cut I used a tutorial about feather razor cutting by Jayne Matthews. It was expensive for me but I knew I wanted to invest in the possibility of not needing professional haircuts so I went for it. @jayne_edosalon on instagram. She exclusively uses a feather razor but to be fair I think you could get a similar effect with regular hair cutting scissors and just following along with where and how she cuts. 

I've never been one to refresh properly. I can usually wear my hair down for the first two days with just pineapple-ing overnight. Then the next two days are half up or up dos and by the 5th day my hair has relaxed from the buns that it almost looks like a blow out and sometimes I can get away with wearing it down again. Also as a mom of two under 3 it ends up in a bun a lot of the time hahaha"

Our-own-recognizance,q582kt,"Help with frizz and flyaways that no product can tame....&&&https://i.imgur.com/1IKHlOP.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/c6amORN.jpg

It might be hard to see in the pictures, but it's looks 10x worse in person. I've got the halo frizz and just frizziness all over that just makes my whole style look so messy. 

This happens about half a day after washing my hair and sticks around no matter what I do. I've tried smoothing oil, gel, and mousse on it while wet AND dry. I've tried giving up and brushing it, to no avail. Adding any product or water after wash day just makes it less defined and stringy, so it is very frustrating. 

My hair is very fine, easily weighed down, and I believe it is low porosity because water beads on it when I spray it. It also appears to have a lot of breakage,but I don't know why!! I rarely use heat on it, I don't brush without conditioner, and I pin it up to sleep.

Routine: I alternate between low poo, cowash, and clarifying shampoos, condition with tresseme botanicals with s2c. Rinse thoroughly. Right now I'm using nym leave in, which I apply with praying hands/scrunching. Microplop and use Aussie instant freeze. Air-dry.

I have been trying to incorporate more protein into my routine, which seems good, but hasn't done much to help my issue. 

I want to embrace the frizziness, but what I got going on just looks so messy, like I just rolled out of bed...and the more I try and fix it the worse it gets!! I'm at a loss of what else to try.&&&Guess it's time to do some more product research!! Haha 
Thanks so much for the suggestions!!"
stormrots,q582kt,Okay so the only flaws a see that could be an easy change for you- silk pillow case and eliminating the instant freeze. The hairspray/instant freeze is better for styling when it‚Äôs already all where you want it to be. I think the Aussie stuff solidifies before any other product has a chance to harden and do it‚Äôs job. Causing for uneven drying and frizz. I also think adding a mousse (strong hold) at the roots would be super beneficial for you. I can‚Äôt live without mouse. I wish you luck!!

2a2b2c,q531he,"I tried to look up the full ingredient list for the shampoo you mention but I can‚Äôt find it, but if it has sulfates and doesn‚Äôt have any silicones or waxes, then it‚Äôd probably work as a clarifying shampoo. 

For the silicone question, are you asking if there are any silicones outside of that list? If you‚Äôre wanting to go strict cgm, there‚Äôs quite a lot of modified silicones that can be sneaky. I don‚Äôt know if you already know about this, but [this site](http://www.isitcg.com) is really helpful for checking over product ingredients, you just copy/paste the list into it and it will break down what everything is and whether it is cgm approved."

Stony1234,q4u5hb,"CGM is worth a try IMO. My hair started out looking a lot like yours (except with more damage) and now my hair is very wavy sometimes curly.

I air dry and that is the worst part because it takes forever, but I only do this once a week/once every two weeks so IMO the payoff is worth it!"
TopAd9634,q4u5hb,Your hair definitely has wave. I would suggest playing around with different techniques and styling products.
ausheidi,q4u5hb,"Trying not to be biased because I have had ONE good hair day since starting CGM type styling‚Äîso, it‚Äôs possibly worth it IF you have time and effort.

holdtheolives,q4u5hb,"I have similar waves to you! For sure you have a hair texture that can be played up with some CGM techniques or products. I‚Äôd suggest choosing things on the lower-cost part of the spectrum, or formulated specifically for wavy hair. You can totally build a heat-free routine if you‚Äôre concerned about tired arms too. 

For me, I made the switch 3 years ago to curly styling and haven‚Äôt looked back. I like the Trader Joe‚Äôs tea tree shampoo and conditioner line - not expensive, smells nice, CG friendly. I wash, condition, clip up on top of my head while I do the rest of showering. Then upside-down detangle using a wide-tooth comb, followed by squishing the hair as I rinse. Finish up with the same conditioner again because it doesn‚Äôt make my hair feel too heavy like other leave-ins do, then plop in a turban for 20 minutes while I get ready. To finish, spray with a de-frizz spray (I like the Eva NYC) and scrunch in a gel or curl cream (Devacurl has worked well for me but has gotten a bad rep in the CG space), set the part, and let air dry. Only like 10 minutes of active messing around with the hair - the rest is just waiting around while doing other stuff. 

Good luck!"
rkmoses,q4u5hb,"this is exactly how my hair is and i'm too lazy to try to get the outer bits to match the inner bits lol. it ends up being way more frustrating and time consuming to try and \~encourage my natural waves\~ than it is to just leave it to fall straight after a day or to just put in some curls/waves myself with a wet set or an overnight curl strat or twisting it as it dries or using an iron or whatever. i do like looking at some of the curly/wavy techniques for figuring out why my hair feels dry or heavy or brittle and what i can do about it, but any time i try the styling stuff i spend a crazy long time being very frustrated and come out the other side with my hair looking the same as or worse than it would if i spent like 2 minutes putting in a leave in and getting some water out w a tee shirt or a towel."

Bunch of ppl said us wavies don't need as much moisture, so I decided not to co-wash but to use the shampoo this time. Left in the conditioner while I shaved/washed face.

Then I rinsed out upside down with cool water. Wrung out hair. Put in moisture Shea hibiscus curl cream (can't remember the exact name but it's something like that. Also used much less this time) then put in Garnier clean gel (less than first time). Plopped for about 15 min.

Thanks for the clarification (sorry...üòÅ).

2b/2c low porosity hair prone to dryness/frizz.&&&Thank you everyone for the info.

Is the Kinky Curly Come Clean considered to be clarifying?"
quietviolence,q4mffa,"It is basically using a product that can remove build up in your hair. Doesn't really matter if it has sulfates in it or not, as long as you're removing the grime and product build up.

I have 2c/3a low porosity hair prone to dryness and frizz as well. I personally really like Neutrogena Anti-residue Shampoo. It is kind of harsh and if I use it too often I get more frizz, so I use a dime sized amount on my roots and scalp about 1 time per month followed by deep conditioning. Afterwards my hair looks refreshed and light and bouncy."
shattered_illusions,q4mffa,"A clarifying shampoo is a shampoo that has sulfates and/or sulfonates capable of removing buildup AND it doesn't contain any silicones or waxes or any other ingredient that can cause buildup for you. If you live in a hard water area, it's probably a good idea to get a clarifying shampoo that also chelates (look for EDTA in the ingredients.)

It's fine to clarify every couple of weeks if your hair likes that. Personally, I like to clarify my hair every 4-6 weeks. I always follow up with a deep conditioner after clarifying."
