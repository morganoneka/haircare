josieneedsalife,a7dfev,"I got layers and that gets my wave up higher (Iâ€™m a type 2b, with a little 2a and 2c depending on if I pin curl or not) and that helped a lot! Also getting a little bit of gel towards the roots, but not a lot because buildup "
mehtotheworld,a7dfev,"How do you longer haired redditors get waves to stay in the crown of your hair?&&&I can get the waves to stay at the bottom with noodle head from Sally's and some salt spray helps the middle but the top just sits there all sad and flat. My hair is thin, think Jennifer Aniston type of hair. Any advice would be great. I use a diffuser too ( omg why did it take me 27 years to learn what those are I am in love with mine) "
myluckyshirt,a7dfev,Depends on how I dry my hair.  I usually have good results if I hang my head upside and diffuser my roots.
