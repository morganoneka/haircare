fatty_bird,j54b1x,What is your hair porosity?
zillarillazilla,j54b1x,"Aloe Vera gel - tried it this week, and am loving it!&&&Hi wavies! I commented about aloe vera gel in another post, and wanted to share how it’s been going with the rest of ya wavies. 

Note on gel: I tried LA Style gel blue bottle from the starter routine on CGM and hated it. I tried it on soaking wet hair, partially wet, damp... it just got stringy and crazy and matted for me. So, I was hesitant to try any other gel, but aloe Vera is cheap and I had it around so I decided to give it a go this week. 

Product: Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel. Very affordable! Other options would be: Lily of the Desert and Target’s Up&Up. Kinky Curly Curling Custard has aloe in it as well, so I might try that sometime (it’s more spendy)

WASH DAY:

-clarify 1x per week with Suave 

-NYM coconut water shampoo

-STC with Tresseme Botanique 

-Flip hair over and pulse/scrunch to form clumps and get some water out

-pulse/scrunch Totally Twisted Mousse (going to try NYM Curl Talk soon, NYM coconut water mousse wasn’t great) 

-aloe Vera gel: good palm full of gel, slap together both hands so hands are coated, gently pulse/scrunch into hair without stretching out wavies/curlies

-plop in microfiber towel for 5 minutes while I do face routine and brush teeth

-take out microfiber and leave alone for 30-45 minutes and the flip/scrunch to get the crunchy bits out 

REFRESH DAY 2:

-in shower, flip hair over and reset reset with handfuls of water

-scrunch/pulse mousse to wet hair in shower

-scrunch/pulse our excess water and scrunch/pulse aloe gel

-scrunch with microfiber towel 

-don’t touch for 30 minutes and then flip/scrunch 


TL;DR: aloe Vera is awesome, you should try it even if you’ve hated other gems. Use after mousse on mostly wet hair before micro-plopping (5 minutes), don’t touch for 30 minutes and then flip/scrunch&&&Probably low-regular according to the curlsbot quiz"
Bimpnottin,j549er,"I don’t have dyed hair atm but I live in a very hard water region so I have to clarify my hair constantly because otherwise I get a crazy amount of build-up. I use Kinky Curly Come Clean for this. It is CG approved and has a chelating ingredient that removes build-up. I use it every wash and it doesn’t leave my hair dry or anything, it feels just like any other CG shampoo I’ve used. I assume it is also gentle enough for dyed hair as I’ve used it in the past on my brown coloured hair and didn’t notice any color fading. It however does not remove ALL build-up, I have to switch every few weeks to a stronger shampoo that contains sulfates and EDTA. But I think a lot of build-up comes from the hard water, so maybe the kinky curly shampoo alone could do the trick for you."
fancylamp12,j549er,"my hair is colored with arctic fox, i’m having build up but clarifying will get rid of the color! what should i do?&&&i have a split dye purple and pink, i need to clarify my hair because im getting a lot of build up. i don’t want to wash the color out but i also don’t want to have to keep washing my hair more often than i need to purely because of build up. what should i do??
routine: i have fine medium-thick density 2A-2B hair. i wash my hair twice a week with Zotos All About Curls shampoo and conditioner (works amazing i love it). Afterward I apply biolage daily leave in tonic, and then the herbal essences curl mousse (but it broke...). for definition i’ll add a LITTLE bit of lightweight gel to my hair the garnier curl sculpt spray gel. the next day i simply refresh with water, but if it’s particularly dry on day 3 i add lavender oil only to the ends which helps with the dryness and makes it wavier. i use cold or lukewarm water when washing to avoid washing out the color. 
also if anyone knows a good color safe shampoo and conditioner that’s CG approved i’d appreciate that although i love Zotos and it hasn’t messed up my hair, i’ve heard my leave in conditioner and my gel are actually no good so if anyone has recommendations on better ones i’m willing to try it! the gel seems to dry out my hair and make it kinda crunchy but i may not be scrunching it all the way in. although i haven’t really noticed anything bad about my leave in conditioner"
hermitcrab00,j549er,"I actually have almost exactly the same issue, and I also have pink and purple hair rn colored with arctic fox(virgin pink and purple rain.) I've been using the Love Beauty &Planet Blooming Color shampoo bar. I like it, but it just isn't clarifying my hair enough.. so I'm switching to the Love Beauty and Planet Tea Tree oil and Vetiver Radical Refresher Shampoo. I haven't tried it yet but I really like their whole line for many other products so maybe give them a try!"

Other info: It comes in a spray bottle, so I find it easiest to spray into my hand and then work into my hair.

My experience: For one, this stuff smells so good! Like lemons! And my hair feels soft. Minimal frizz, but not all gone

I'm not sure what my curl pattern is, but I have fine, dense hair."
FrizzychunkCAT,j543yc,"I can’t wait to see the responses here. I seriously don’t know how to tell if my leave-in is even doing anything. Since it is sandwiched in the middle of washing products and styling products, I think it is the hardest one to evaluate."

Other Info from website: Repair, restore, and condition your overworked curls with this uber softening leave in conditioner. Formulated certified organic blueberry extract, coconut oil, grapeseed oil and mango butter. Clinically proven to repair damaged hair, encourage hair growth, and prevent breakage.
 
My experience: So nice! This leave-in really helps with the moisture/protein balance. I like to keep my shampoo and conditioner moisturizing and then use this along with styling products that contain protein to balance everything out. Helps a lot with wet frizz, and also coats the strands really well, promoting curl clumps very successfully. 

My hair type: 2a/b/c, colored, medium/coarse thickness, fairly high density, low porosity (I think), and recovering from significant heat damage."
Jasmisne,j543yc,"Name: Mielle Pom and Honey leave in conditioner 

Opinions and experience: this is designed for type 4 hair but I use it on my extremely low porosity hair and it is such a good one for me, I figured I would put it here in case anyone else with low po waves is struggling to find a leave in they like. This is great if you really like heavier leave ins as opposed to light ones. I use it on soaking wet hair post clarifying wash, and I follow it with Mielle twisting souffle for my cream, argon oil, and then some gel. It leaves my hair soft and clean feeling for days. 

Oh and it smells so good!

Other information: This is expensive. lol. But it was the first leave in conditioner i ever bought and i like it. it does the job in detangling, providing extra hydration, and is a heat protectant. It contains protein so it makes my hair feel nice and bouncy after using it. It's a spray so its light, great for fine hair.It might just be me loving high end products and being brainwashed but i have one other leave in, the As I Am one, and I prefer this one, it makes my hair look better. I looked up the ingredients and it's actually CG approved, ""with caution"" regards to the cyclopenasiloxane/cyclohhexasilocane but it says that is probably removable with a non-sulfate shampoo. I personally clarify once a month so i dont mind using silicone even ones that arent water soluble.  


An ingredient that really intrigues me is the hydrolized elastin."
WeAreStarless,j543yc,"Building the Wavy Favourite List — leave-in conditioners&&&Hi again!

I think we all know the drill by now :) This is part three of building the Wavy Favourites List, and [cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wavyhair/comments/ivs46p/survey_results_request_for_shampoo_recommendations/) and [conditioners](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wavyhair/comments/j07iiq/building_the_wavy_favourites_list_deep/) are over on the left (if you're on desktop, that is — I'm not sure if the concept of post collections exists on mobile at all). 

This week, I would love to know your leave-in conditioner recommendations, and it doesn't matter if they're silicone free or not. Same as the previous times, you can recommend multiple products, but for each product, I would like you to copy and paste this little list and fill it in.

If you are from a country that is not the USA and the product is only available where you live, please mention which country and recommend it anyway! We are sorely lacking non-American resources.

And then this is optional, because I don't even know what I'm going to do with this information in regards to the products, but I figure I might as well ask and see if I see any kind of trend.

Your experience/opinion: I really love this stuff! It has a good amount of slip, and I find that it helps a lot with getting my hair to clump. It's also very light-weight--even if I use a lot, it never feels producty, but still makes my hair feel soft and stay hydrated for longer. I usually apply to wet hair, but sometimes I apply a small amount to totally dry hair if my hair is feeling really dry, and it works great like that too. The scent is also very very light, which I appreciate.

jbelrookie,j543yc,"**Name:** Shea Moisture 100% Coconut Oils Daily Hydration Leave In Treatment


**Hair info:**

• 2A waves

• Medium to high density

• Coarse/strong hair (bleached areas I'd say is medium)

**Ingredients:** 
Water, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*†, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Coconut Acid, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Algae Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail) Extract, Argania Spinosa Kernel (Argan) Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit (Rosehip) Oil, Tocopherol, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum Extract, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend)

**Other info:** 
CG friendly. Contains glycerin. If you look closely, there are a couple of proteins on here. Hydrolyzed keratin is supposed to be smaller in weight, penetrative the hair shaft better to improve hair elasticity and moisture. Hydrolyzed veg protein is apparently heavier in weight and forms a film over the hair for shine and protection.


**My experience:** I know many seem to keep away from Shea Moisture on here because their products can be quite heavy/weigh down waves. But I think with my hair type being on the thick, dense, coarser side + the texture of this product being a little lighter than what I imagine a lot of their other stuff is, I've liked it so far. As I mentioned, my hair is coarse and therefore quite abundant in protein naturally lol but some of my hair is also bleached and I think this is a great shot of protein for those damaged areas. I also find this helps my hair's natural waves come out even before styling it. I feel like this leave in is also quite moisture heavy in some ways too, containing a lot of emollients and humectants too. I do find that I have to somewhat SOTC with this and tends to make my hair feel a little textured once it's dried, but over Day 2 and beyond (especially if I don't style it with some crunchy gel etc) leaves my hair feeling softer until my next wash day."

Other information: Semi small bottle it seems but lasts a long time. $12 USD or so at Target. Black owned brand :D

  
Your experience/opinion: I love this stuff! It is amazing for my fine hair that gets easily weighed down. It is a very lightweight creamy/gel texture and can be either rinsed out and used as a conditioner, or left-in. It immediatlely gives you that seaweed feeling and clumps hair effortlessly. It never feels like it leaves any sort of buildup and leaves a very light scent on your hair. It makes my hair very soft and supple and almost cuts all of my frizz. It seems to play well with every single styler I have tried and I usually just use it without a styler and air dry my hair. It makes detangling super easy and I love the feeling of slip it gives that keeps you from damaging your hair when wet brushing. My favorite way to use this is on a clarifying wash day as my conditioner and I rinse almost all of it out. My hair is light and airy and feels super smoothe."

notesofastranger,j53kdg,"This makes me want to throw out all my products and buy exactly what you bought 😂 but i want to try your techniques first.

Questions: 
Roughly how much of each product do you apply? 

and do you wash upside down or side to side etc?&&&I just tried the wet plopping using a shower cap and it worked so well, i got such nice clumps! But then i wasn't sure what to do, so after microplopping ( upside-down) i diffused (also upside down) for a bit then got bored and the clumps started to all break apart and it went straggly.

So I'm curious - after styling and microplopping upside down, what do you do to avoid a straggly mess?"
professionalhippo1,j53kdg,"I had no idea I had wavy hair until a friend told me to try CGM. These are 6 months of progress pics. I’ll post my current routine in the comments.&&&&&&😂😂😂 thank you&&&Hair stats: low porosity, fine width, medium density, easily weighed down. 

Routine:
Pre-poo: soak hair and apply Lidl hair mask generously. Leave on for 2 minutes, squish to condish. Flip head over and Without rinsing first, cleanse with Maui moisture Shine + Awapuhi shampoo. Liberally apply Maui Moisture Shine + Awapuhi conditioner to soaking wet hair and gently finger detangle. Clip back/cover with shower cap and leave on for 5 minutes. Flip back over, thoroughly squish to condish and rinse. Glaze SGX NYC curl power curl cream over soaking wet hair and use a wide tooth comb to distribute and scrunch in. Add a little more water  without rinsing the curl cream out, scrunch in Eco style avocado oil gel that has been emulsified in water so you can Scrunch it in until thoroughly coated. Wet plop in a shower cap for 5-10 minutes to let gel soak in. Microplop/scrunch with t shirt or flannel baby blanket to remove excess water. Glaze Cake whipped curl mousse over hair and scrunch in. Diffuse to ~75% dry (takes me about 10-15 minutes). Air dry as long as necessary to get to 100% dry and scrunch out the crunch. Scrunch in a small amount of Cake The hot mess dry texture foam&&&I still can’t believe it! How the hell was all that hiding in there? 😂 I had two small patches underneath my hair and she said all of my hair could probably do it. I was SO skeptical but I am glad I listened to her! It was when the pandemic shut downs were all getting started so I figured if I looked awful no one would see me!&&&I totally understand the cost factor as a block. I spent a lot of time upfront learning about porosity, density and width as well as ingredients and application techniques so I could make educated guesses for what I thought my hair would like and even then it was still quite a search.

I spent 32 years assuming my hair was straight but ugly and so I can say it is really hard to start when you have no true idea of what your potential is. When you are going from hair that appears straight enough that people with curly hair roll their eyes at you for thinking you could possibly have wavy hair literally almost anything helps bring the waves out. But when those are the wrong products/techniques for you the waves fall out after a couple hours and you get mad you wasted all the time for nothing! Early on when I had no idea what I was doing. I would diffuse for an hour to get barely 50 percent dry and never even get a cast. Then it would take all day to air dry into a almost straight ugly fluffy mess. I nearly gave up but the scientist in me knew if I was methodical I could figure it out so I am glad I persisted.&&&😂

I’m pretty generous with my products. I’m not sure if amounts because I use as much as I need to get my hair to feel right at each step. Next wash day I’ll make some notes and come back and let you know. 

I do everything upside down.&&&So I actually laugh a little when I think about how I used to take care of my hair. 

Wash with suave daily clarifying shampoo, glaze suave daily clarifying conditioner over and immediately rinse it, wear it in a turbie-twist for several hours , rake anti-frizz serum through and follow with a brush and air dry and go straight into a bun. If I wanted to look nice I would blow dry upside down while brushing it and then follow up with a straight iron. 

I wish someone had told me a long time ago that if you have to straighten your straight hair then it really isn’t straight!&&&Thank you! 

I have no idea how no hair dresser ever mentioned that I have wavy hair. My main complaint, frizzy triangle hair, I have learned is a classic wavy hair problem. It’s so obvious in hindsight now that I know what I know. But their solution was to just thin my hair out with a razor. I think they just assumed I knew I had wavy hair but wanted my hair to be straight.&&&Thank you! ❤️🖤&&&Thank you! 

Honestly, I started making traction when I gave up trying to follow strict cgm. I avoid sulfates and silicones but that’s it. I never cowash, never use leave in conditioner, and I diffuse with high heat and speed. 

The last puzzle piece of figuring out my routine was being willing to use shampoos with olefin sulfonate more than once a month. Using it as a regular wash day shampoo means I have to prepoo to avoid drying my hair out but that’s a concession I’m happy to make.&&&Thank you!&&&If I diffuse until I get a hard cast (about 10 minutes) my clumps don’t fall apart. What are you using for your hold product?&&&Thank you! 

Yes I start shampooing with the mask still on my hair."

I agree with Geneva that 2Cs are more likely to find CGM helpful, but most newbies aren’t asking because they think it’s relevant for product or routine recs, they just wanna know because there’s a shit ton of misinformation out there about curl types."
ForTheLoveOfOwls,j52sp6,"I also need “reassurance” some times that my hair actually counts as wavy. Without an idea how to handle my hair naturally, I went with “lots of heavy products, load up the heat protection straightener, flat iron it daily (less on days 2-4 after wash, but just to fix it where it reverted), and let the ends mostly be to curve naturally, so to reduce damage and keep length longer”.

So everyone sees me with straight hair and think I do something special with the straightener to get my ends like that and they want me to teach them the technique. Ummmm...yeah, my hair just isn’t naturally straight.

As a result of seeing hair care recommendations on just the two extremes growing up, I think some of us just didn’t know that our experiences were real/valid to others. Also I think that some people like me spend a weird amount of time defending our hair type to people who don’t believe us? So reassurance can be super helpful that we’re not just “trying to be special” or “making things more difficult”, etc. Getting others to say it (especially Internet people without a preconceived notion of us) can be very validating, to have that outside perspective."
FrizzychunkCAT,j52sp6,"If I was a noob and I posted “what’s my curl type?” Getting a response like this one that is well thought out and informative and encouraging would have made me feel hopeful! I’m always chasing the curl dragon. It’s disappointing and discouraging for wavies in a way that curlies don’t seem to understand. Literally going from curly to not curly, it’s like my hair has multiple personalities.  I’m currently sitting here with a barely 2a head of hair, and 2 wash days ago I was looking like a 3a-b. 

For an auto response, I would love to see it be an encouraging, hopeful, and informative one that lets people know they can certainly ask that question,  but that it also isn’t super important because it will likely be a variable, not a constant. (Similar to how the things that really make someone attractive are posture and a smile, the things to worry about with hair are increasing health and learning styling that works for you.)"
GenevaGrey,j52sp6,"I \*hate\* that automod in r/curlyhair and it's a big reason why I'm not a member there anymore. The difference between 2, 3, and 4 absolutely does matter, especially since we 2s have much different needs and experiences than 3s and 4s. Within the 2 type, I think it can matter--2Cs may have better luck with traditional CGM while 2As may be more likely to find that it makes their hair freak out.

Sometimes (most of the time?) people are curious about what other people think, and getting an ""it doesn't matter!"" message is obnoxious. Does it have to ""matter"" to ask for an opinion? Sometimes people want reassurance that their hair is actually curly, or is curly enough to ""count."" Sometimes it is curl envy, and yeah, that's not a great mindset, but I don't think it's inherently harmful to ask."
Heilah,j52sp6,"This is a hard one! And I think it's hard to get a consensus. Personally I think thickness and porosity are more important. I often find when I'm looking at posts people will say their curl type is the same as mine but then they'll say they have fine hair which is easily weighed down, whereas i have really thick, high density hair so I'll assume their tips probably aren't gonna work for me. Generally I find it really hard to get any tips for my texture.
I also think there's a lot of conflicting information around about what does and doesn't work for certain curl types and I just dont think it's that simple (unfortunately). For example, a lot of wavies swear by mousse (as a lightweight product) but mousse does nothing for me and I need to use a real strong hold gel. And there was a post on here recently about the wavy girl method which said all wavy hair types get weighed down but lightweight products just dont cut it for me. 
I think curl types are helpful for people starting out as a guide for what to try but ultimately you will have to do some trial and error because no two heads of hair are the same.
Interested to hear others' thoughts on this!"
Jasmisne,j52sp6,"Light weight leave ins are my least favorite thing lol.

IMO the biggest issue of anything you leave in your hair is the question of if you can absorb it or not. For my low porosity, thick leave ins with the right formulation to actually be absorbed by the hair is way better than a thin one that will just sit on top of my hair. The wavy hair needs light stuff does not do well for us who have hair that needs the extra moisture, if I use a thin leave in, brushing my hair gets very difficult in the days following the wash, and it gets oily, where as LCO with gel on wet hair using my current mielle pom and honey leave in + twisting souffle and argon oil leaves it soft and clean feeling despite it seeming like it would be too heavy. 

I think it is also something we sort of have to figure out on our own with the info out there what might work and what wont, I have learned I am way more likely to do well on a product that some of the low porosity youtubers recommend. In searching for low porosity products, most low porosity influencers are black women. I would not have thought my hair would like products mainly designed for black hair, but my hair loves it. My schedule is definitely different than what would suit black hair, but the products work and so I have gotten my best routines by adapting what works for low porosity black influencers, I have yet to have success with even one product that seems to work for white cgm women.
Wavy hair products are primarily designed for white people, and as an asian my hair texture is quite different from white hair, and the products act differently on my hair. I have found a lot of the advice for wavy hair out there is by white women, and so taking stock of what works for different hair types, not just curl patterns, is a challenge everyone who does cgm has to figure out. 

My point in all of this is that while hair is hair, there are so many factors and ethnicity is one of them I think taking into account helps. There are so many factors to hair and there are overlaps between what works for each of the factors, there is not a one size fits all and curl pattern focus when trying to find products is almost always not the best way unless you have a very specific set of hair qualities. Products that are promoted for wavy hair is almost always going to be more suited for fine-medium, low-medium density, med-high porosity hair  Which is great if you fit that, but if you do not then looking at what works for different hair types and figuring out how you can modify that is key.&&&I think for type 2 hair, the specific wave pattern is basically irrelevant as to what works. My hair is very low porosity and my current leave in and cream are designed for type 4. My hair is not super wavy, def fall into the 2a, 2b on a really good day, mostly the lower hairs on the inside have a stronger wave pattern, but following advice for 2a would make my hair miserable. I suspect that this is true for a few of us with wavy hair, every time I see someone with wavy hair who did not do well on cgm I wonder if they were using all the wrong products for their hair because it was what wavies are supposed to do. I have seen things like 'if you have wavy hair you can not fully wash your conditioner out' which would make my hair so gross. I agree that density, thickness, and porosity are far more important than what type 2 are you."
PANTSorGTFO,j52sp6,"Does it matter for driving decisions about care and products? Not so much. Does it matter to people to know anyway? If it didn't, people wouldn't keep asking."
SnooOranges9863,j52sp6,"Curl type doesnt really matter imo. Porosity, coarse/fine hair, density, and scalp (oily/dry) matters a lot."
Stopiamalreadydead,j52sp6,Same and then sometimes I put in maximal effort and get 2A and sometimes I go to sleep with my hair wet and it's 2C. Wavy hair has a mind of its own for sure.
WavyChoy,j52sp6,I think porosity and thickness are way more important than curl type for wavies. So I would agree!
Wavyhaircare,j52sp6,"I don't think curl pattern impacts how you care for your hair. I think *occasionally* when people ask about their curl pattern, it's because they are confused and think it does impact how to care for their hair? I think that's the exception, though. I think most people who are asking about their curl pattern know it doesn't matter in terms of care, but still just want to know. It's probably tied to insecurities in some cases. I think sometimes people on the looser end of the wavy spectrum are just wanting confirmation that they are in fact, a wavy. Or for some others they might kind of have 'curl envy' and are hoping to be told they are primarily 2c or something like that. 

Others may just be confused about what each one actually looks like. On Instagram in particular, I've seen a lot of people label themselves as curl types that just don't match my understanding of the curl chart, so I can imagine that if someone has seen people with dramatically different curl types all calling themselves 2B, for example, that it might make people super confused about what 2B is supposed to look like."
WeAreStarless,j52sp6,"What are your opinions about curl typing within the wavy category?&&&**TL;DR: Does the dinstinction between 2a, 2b and 2c matter?**

&#x200B;

Hi everyone!

I personally think curl typing is absolutely irrelevant. I originally hail from r/curlyhair, where we try to instill in everyone that curl type does not matter, and that porosity, density and strand thickness are more important. For example, if you have two people, one with wavy, high porosity, dense, coarse hair and one with curly, low porosity, thin, fine hair, the idea that waves always require lighter products and curls heavier products doesn’t really make sense, does it?

Or at least, that’s the way I saw it. And then I started moderating r/wavyhair, and I learned that there was a whole community of people who definitely did think the curly commandments did not work for wavies, and I was taught [all the things that do work for wavies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wavyhair/comments/irc62r/what_about_the_curly_girl_method_does_not_work/), instead. Alright, I stand corrected! So now we’re [working towards our own resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wavyhair/comments/ivs46p/survey_results_request_for_shampoo_recommendations/) that should be more suitable for the majority of wavies.

But within this wavy community, I still see the question “what is my curl type?” being asked a lot, and that’s where my confusion comes back in — surely the difference between 2a, 2b and 2c doesn’t really matter? Curl typing isn’t an exact science (what these three variations mean is different in each curl type chart you come across), and our hair isn’t either. For example:

* My curl type is different on my roots compared to my ends
* My curl type is different on the strands framing my face compared to the back of my head
* My curl type is different on day 1 compared to day 7
* My curl type is different on every wash day
* My curl type is different now compared to nearly 2 years ago when I started the Curly Girl Method

I imagine that’s the case for all of us, right? So I was halfway through implementing an automoderator message that would reply to everyone asking about their curl type with “It doesn’t matter! Check out these resources on porosity, density and strand thickness instead” when I realised that maybe you guys would not agree with that. So what do you all think? Is there a relevance to curl typing within the wavy category?

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: Does the dinstinction between 2a, 2b and 2c matter?**&&&Ah, sorry! I meant curl typing _within_ the wavy category, so 2a, 2b and 2c. I've added a TL;DR to the post now."
builtthiscityon,j52sp6,"I think it does matter for drying technique though! And it does matter for styling because wavy hair has bigger clumps. So if using a denman brush the way it’s supposed to be used on a type 3 curl will have potential undesirable effects and hair will be confused if you accidentally force the clumps apart because you’re using a type 3 curl technique&&&The typing matters, but in a round about way. Knowing what your curl type is and how it might behave based on your hairs texture and how your water interacts with your products and your hair. 

It matters because it will change how you interact with your hair. Knowing your curl type on your best day is a way to tell why your curls aren’t cooperating. 

*Let me explain why and how it matters*: it matters because of the need to troubleshoot problems in the unpredictable journey of getting to know how to care for wavy and curly hair, especially in the 2’s and 3a- and truly it can even apply to all 9 curl types. Talking about wavy hair specifically; it’s important to the consumer to know their wavy/curl ‘type’ so they can know what results to expect from their hair. From knowing and identifying your hairs potential you can then troubleshoot issues that have to do with protein and moisture whether it’s an excess or absence of either; and all other troubleshooting problems. Knowing the curl type should NOT influence the product you purchase as a consumer because it doesn’t matter, BUT knowing the curl type can help identify types of products and ingredients that prevent your curls from reaching their full potential. That’s done with mainly hairs texture and sensitivity. 

To explain that in a different way- I have a mix of 2a, 2b, 2c all over my head and I have some 3a-b curls around my face and behind my ears on my hairline that I never knew existed. People want to know their curl type so they can know what to expect as an end result and when the end result isn’t producing good, healthy, defined waves in a consistent pattern either we seek out the information to troubleshoot or we give up. 


Lots of wavy hair can dry pretty straight. *raises hand* I deal with this all the time. As my hair is growing in healthier it’s becoming curlier while I air dry it but when I put the right products in it it’s got me looking like Medusa until all the ends are finally cut off lol. As curls get healthier they become curlier. So typing matters to check your progress if nothing else. 

And it’s important to note that curl patterns can change due to hormone stuff! So that’s a big one to keep in mind. When I stopped birth control at 28 years old my hair began growing in biiiiiiig and curly with an entirely different texture. 

It’s also important for getting your hair cut and what style you want to have from what cut"
fatty_bird,j52sp6,"> Sometimes (most of the time?) people are curious about what other people think, and getting an ""it doesn't matter!"" message is obnoxious. Does it have to ""matter"" to ask for an opinion? 

I think this is very true. Sure, maybe determining hair/curl type isn't that important (or important at all), but people seem to like to do it anyway. And it doesn't hurt! So, there's no reason to discourage it, at least that I can see."
professionalhippo1,j52sp6,"I don’t think it matters much for product/technique recommendations, it is nice to know. 

I think it’s pretty tricky for wavies because in addition to all the things you listed how my hair looks is also very dependent on styling on wash day. Minimal effort I’m 2A/2B and with maximal effort I’m 2C ( I think? 😂)"
tranquil_turtle,j52sp6,"I don't think curl typing is super important but still generally good to know. Like wavy vs curly vs coily as it effects how the sebum from your scalp can move down the hair strands. I always use the original curl type chart for reference as that's the one I was taught in my college course. Texture (the shape of your hair strands) is also fairly important as it tells you how strong your hair strands are, which is directly related to how curly your hair is. For us wavies the protein structure is fairly even so our hair strands are stronger than those with coily hair where the protein structure is very thin and uneven making their hair very delicate and prone to breakage. Though I think porosity and knowing how to balance moisture and protein are generally more important when choosing products to take care of your specific hair."
Bimpnottin,j50end,I am so glad I came across this comment because I just bought the shea moisture protein mask and was about to apply it in a few days. I also have the papaya hair food at home so I’m going to combine the two instead for a first try.
SmartOwls,j50end,"I use shea moisture hydrate + repair protein power treatment on my hair after clarifying. My hair is really bleach damaged so it looooooves protein. My waves are so much bouncier and hold better when I use protein. My waves are limp and stringy when I try a moisturizing mask or conditioner. 

In the shower after clarifying I will apply small pea sized amounts to my hair and brush it through to detangle, then let it sit for a few minutes in a bun or shower cap while i wash my face and body and finish the rest of my shower. Then I rinse it out upside down using the squish to condish method, but for like rinsing it out."

And I don't want to clutter the sub with too many threads, so on a vaguely related note: has anyone ever used The Ordinary's Amino Aids + B5 on their hair? Even though it's made for the face, the combination of amino acids and panthenol seems like it might suit the hair well."
_boatsandhoes,j50end,"I used the shea protein power once as a mask and it dried the HELL out of my hair. It was so rough, frizzy and dry but then I'd moisturize and it seemed to be too much. 

I've found that using half shea protein power/half garnier papaya hair food worked really well last time as a conditioner!  It kept the waves throughout the day.

I would try adding a little protein to your routine first before doing a mask as it could overdo it."
acatreadingamap,j50end,My hair can’t seem to get enough protein! I really get a lot more wave and definition after using protein. I started out with the shea moisture yogurt and Manuka honey mask because it seems to be highly recommended on these subs and I’ve just stuck to it! I love the results of that mask so much I’ve considered using it every wash day
ndhewitt1,j50end,"What’s weird is that when I used to use protein on my hair and dry it straight, it made my hair horrible. So dry. So I assumed my hair hated protein. I could never keep my hair moisturizer enough. But since I really made a concerted effort the last few weeks to wear my hair in it’s natural 2a/b/c texture, I can’t seem to get enough protein. My hair seems chronically over moisturized. And the more protein, the more texture (which is prob why I hated it when I was trying to pretend to face straight hair). I’ve been using Giovanni smooth as silk conditioner and either curl talk cream or blueberry bliss leave in. I ordered neutral protein filler to try to use my non-protein products."
xol225,j50end,"If you’re looking for a strong protein treatment I got the matcha boost from ecoslay recently and I’ve liked it so far! I’ve two treatments with it so far and my hair has really liked it. I’ve never tried the curl junkie, but from what I’ve heard of it it seems like it had a similar protein level to the matcha boost but the curl junkie also does some conditioning while the matcha boost doesn’t do much for that. I can get away with just it and then a leave in, but my hair is also chronically over moisturized."
zillarillazilla,j50end,"The curl talk styling cream or the conditioner?

dianacakes,j4zp3o,"I want to thank whoever it was in this sub who suggested hammock diffusing to me!&&&&&&You put your dryer/diffuser on the counter. With your head upside down, use your plopping shirt/towel like a hammock to support your hair while moving side to side. Start with your hair squished almost all the way up while you target your roots. Then gradually lower the shirt. I did this til about 50% dry this time, which is enough to start a cast, then hovered while flipping my hair from side to side upright.&&&I'm just under 7 months into the CGM. In the beginning I only pixie diffused but my waves were never consistent and they always looked forced and wonky. A couple of months ago I started hover diffusing, which let me see my hair's actual wave pattern, which I loved, but it's very elongated. On one of my previous posts here someone suggested hammock diffusing, which is where you set you dryer on a counter, then use your plopping towel/shirt to gently support the hair while moving side to side. I've been playing around with it for a couple of weeks and this is the best result I've had so far! I think it's because I did it longer before switching to hover diffusing. I also use my free hand to ""cup"" my hair while hovering to encourage shrinkage. 

Products for this wash day:

Clarified with Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo 

Deep conditioned with Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen and Restore Treatment Masque.  I brushed it through for even distribution. I put on a shower cap and wrapped a towel around my head to trap in heat and left it on for 30 minutes. 

Used a TINY bit of Curls Blueberry Bliss leave in - like a dime size, brushed through and scrunched. I've been using leave-in as my first styler, so I flip, shake and scrunch my hair to situate the clumps. 

Plopped for 10 minutes.

On damp hair, I sprayed Aussie Curl Refresher spray all over my hair, but more focused on the roots and middle lengths. I do this right side up and upside down to make sure I get all parts of my hair evenly. This product is my #1 because it has a really good amount of hold but it's light and doesn't weigh my hair down. 

Glazed on Not Your Mother's Curl Talk mousse, then flat hand scrunched it. Then I preceded to diffusing. 

The spray and mousse together make a hard cast and if I use too much of either then it's super product-y. I got the right amounts this time!&&&Thank you!&&&I actually have been cutting it myself since the start of covid! I've done 3 at home cuts, the last one was a couple of weeks ago. I try to mimic what I've seen stylists do when they cut my hair in layers. Basically if I'm completely upside down then all my hair is the same length if that makes sense. If I were to go to a stylist I would ask for all over layers, with the shortest layer at about chin length."

HiHungryImDad25,j4zfac,"I was on Accutane as well and found that I could drastically cut down on washing it, which helped immensely. Basically the medicine dries out your body and stops oil production on your scalp as well. I ended up only washing my hair once a week. 

Also, I don't remember where I saw but I've seen warnings against taking biotin while on Accutane, so i would look that up if I were you."
KiloGrah4m,j4zfac,"What's wrong with my hair?&&&I recently started taking Acutane (acne medication which makes your skin super dry) and have noticed my hair suffering 

Check out this [pic](https://i.imgur.com/SWSqUld.jpg). I'm wondering why do I have so many loose strands at the top, is this frizz, is the hair dry or damaged some other way?

I'm new to the hair care world (only started growing it out during the pandemic!) but here's what I'm doing:

-Sol Janeiro's Brazilian Joia Shampoo and Conditioner, Shampoo once/twice a week, conditioner every other day

-Air dry, I've stopped using blow dryer

-Living Proof's Nourishing Styling Cream (I've since replaced this with the products below)

-It's a 10's miracle leave-in product

-OGX's B5 Weightless oil mist (this seems to be the best for helping with dryness!)

-Mostly wear pony tails and don't brush much, although i'm trying not to wear it in a pony tail as often

-Going to start taking Biotin to counter some of the Acutane side-effects

Now, I normally would not consider my hair wavy, but the HaircareScience subreddit pointed me here. If you have any advise I'd be extremely thankful, worried for my hair right now&&&Other than washing less frequently, how else did you deal with dryness, any products? Like I said, I'm using an oil spray but the amount of oil I have to use is ridiculous!

Have not read anything bad about mixing acutane and biotin, will look into it. Just want to help with the potential thinning side effect (i don't even know how to check for thinning tbh)"

On damp, unwashed and preferably detangled hair (you can detangle with olaplex but with me, I tend to lose a lot of product that way, so I detangle my hair first). I then usually separate my hair into 4-6 sections and apply about a quarter size amount to each section, focusing on the most damaged parts of my hair. I also take largeish sections and finger curl them the direction of the curl (I'm following my natural pattern- most of my curls go the same way). Put on a shower cap and leave on for at least 30 minutes, but my preferred time is at least an hour to three hours (some people sleep with in and I tried that once but found that it didn't do anything extra). Afterwards, wash and style as normal.

Then I used that weird spiky silicon brush thingy to really scrub my scalp clean. After shampoo I used a coustum conditioner from Function of beauty. 
I squish condintioner into my hair and let it sit there while I scrub my body with body wash, and do my skin care in the shower. I then flip my hair upside down to rinse it all out and squeeze it! I dont like to leave product in my hair at all. Then after I'm done washing I wrap my hair into a pink microfiber towel. The end. I dont use gel or mousse cause it makes my hair feel oily."
EquivalentFlounder2,j4o6lg,Yah I'd recommend a keratin hair mark and try gel and cotc with oil.
LittlePositive3,j4o6lg,Have you tested your hair for porosity?
WavyChoy,j4o6lg,"Have you tried homemade flaxseed gel? I get really good shine and definition with that stuff. Also Kinky Curly Curling Custard. 

Do you apply your stylers to wet hair? More water = bigger curl clumps!"
bawnknee,j4o6lg,"I feel like my waves are blah and dry&&&&&&I style with pure aloe. I've tried using mousse but I feel it weighs down my hair. 

I have to wash and condition daily or else my hair is an absolute disaster. 

I've tried curl cream and look weighed down and greasy.&&&It's low"
Coconut_Rhubarb,j4ldi7,What was your DIY protein treatment?
Sewpuggy,j4ldi7,"Six weeks into transitioning. I did a diy protein treatment last night and this is the best my hair has looked during this. Any suggestions to get better clumps? You can see it looks stringy at the bottom.&&&&&&Thank you&&&Wash and stc with NYM Tahitian shampoo and conditioner.  Detangled and plopped for 5 minutes. UFD Curly Magic raked through, NYM curl talk mousse squished in with additional water as needed. Pixie diffused until 90% dry. When fully dry I used a pick on my roots to add volume, picked through the rest of my hair lightly.&&&Thanks&&&I used one from My Merry Messy Life.  https://mymerrymessylife.com/gelatin-hair-diy-protein-treatment/"
b_mco,j4ldi7,"For me (in terms of styling), I found that using some gel on wet hair and micro-plopping, then plopping, gave me best results. However, I rarely use gel now. I’m not patient enough for the drying time and I don’t diffuse. I will either just use a cream with the same method, or lightly scrunch in a little mousse after plopping. 

Whatever method or product I choose to use largely depends on what my hair needs at that time and what I will be doing for the day (or next day) after my shower. 

Sometimes it’s just random too. After months of trying all sorts of things, I discovered that the less I fret and fuss over my hair, the more it works for me. Also, a big thing was just accepting my hair for what it is. I’ve had the most success with that. 

However, it took me at least a few months to figure out my individual needs, so don’t stress too much right now! You will find the best routine for your hair soon enough."
ckeeman,j4ldi7,"I keep seeing people speak of aloe Vera for their hair. What’s with that? When do you use it, in relation to your other products, and what does it do? I’m so curious, and tomorrow is my wash day, so i may just have to try something new!"
roundy_yums,j4ldi7,"Maybe try a Denman brush? There are a bunch of YouTube tutorials that show different Denman techniques. It can help with clumps and curl shape. 

It looks good as is though!"
zillarillazilla,j4ldi7,"It looks great!! Maybe try a gel on top of the mousse for more clumps (I’m not sure, but aloe Vera gel has changed my wavy game)"
jmom7,j4jnnw,"Have you tried using a leave-in conditioner before putting on the Cantu? My hair is similar to yours, and I've had good results with that.&&&I haven't tried the SM deep conditioner. What did you think of that? I've liked Bio-Silk silk therapy 17 Miracle spray leave-in and Giovanni Direct Leave-in Moisture Conditioner. I have very high porosity hair, so I have to watch glycerin when it's humid. I think BioSilk has glycerin but Giovanni does not."
lydsquad,j4jnnw,"I think a cut that includes more layers, plus a stronger gel (like LA looks or Curlsmiths soufflé) would serve you really well :) my hair gets stringy and weird if it gets to a certain length so I feel your pain. Best of luck!"
ndsales,j4jnnw,"Update after I posted yesterday. I tried using SM deep conditioner! Thoughts?&&&&&&Today I applied the SM Shea butter deep treatment masque and left it in for half an hour. Then I used NYM shampoo and conditioner in the pink bottles. I use a tangle teezer to comb through my hair while the conditioner is in. Squish to condish. 

After my shower, I got some water out with a microfiber towel and then applied Cantu Curl Activator. I brushed through with a denman brush. Then I used Eco Argon Oil gel. 

I clipped my roots, diffused until about 50% dry, then air dried the rest of the way, then scrunched out the crunch. 

I’m not sure the deep treatment did anything because this is usually what it looks and feels like on wash day. I’ll keep trying it though. I know nothing happens overnight. 

I would still like to add shine and get rid of the stringiness. Any ideas for that? Or is it just something that comes with time? Should I do the treatment and cleansing/conditioning in a different order? Are there other products you would recommend? 

I’ve been strict curly girl for only two months. My hair is high porosity, coarse, and dense. 

What do you think my curl type is? 

Thanks!!&&&Mine doesn’t seem to get weighed down easily. 

Good luck to you as well!&&&I tried the As I Am leave in, but it didn’t do anything for me. I’m thinking about trying the Curls Blueberry Bliss leave in. Which leave in do you like?&&&Thank you for the suggestions. I have a hair appt this month and I think I will get more layers. And I’ll look for those gels!&&&Honesty, I don’t think it did much. But I will probably try it again."
willever1,j4jnnw,"No advise. My high porosity, med density, fine hair looks exactly like yours. I haven’t won’t the battle again stringy yet and am eternally looking to get more hydration that doesn’t weigh down and large clumps. Good luck!"
Dradiss,j4i8p2,"Having similar hair problems an super stringy looking curls my self the best option I have found was to not use styling product at all.

I only use from time to time a super light conditioner when showering, that's it. After I'm done washing my hair I just  scrunch it with no product at all on my hands, them left air-drying and not touching a single hair.

When it's completely dry I would use the smallest amount of jojoba oil on both my hands and fluff it out gently. 
It has a lite bit of frizz, but lots of volume and body in my case; it looks like ivr I had double the amount of hair I truly have.

The bad thing it's that for me it only look good during the washing day, soni would have to refresh the next day but if you wash your hair daily this shouldn't be a problem for you"
Emma2181,j4i8p2,"I have super fine hair too. You can use a volumizing mousse instead of one for curls, because if you’re going for volume, anything “defining” is going to work against your volume. You’ll see lots of advice about achieving clumps, but even when I have managed to achieve nice big clumps, I have like 5 of them, so it still looks bad. Along that line, don’t be afraid to brush your hair once the waves have formed. Lots will say not to, but in my experience, it makes a huge difference and I still keep a good amount of wave. Diffusing also works great for adding volume."
Raquel2005,j4i8p2,"Wavy Hair Advice!!!&&&     I have wavy hair and am struggling to figure out how to take care of it. My hair is super thin and fine. My waves are so super stringy that its almost embarrassing how it looks and I either straighten it or end up putting it up because I hate how it looks. I follow like all the steps to the methods there are and still have super stringy hair. I shampoo and condition daily because my hair is super oily. Then once I get out of shower I scrunch my hair and use the plopping technique. I don't diffuse though because I am trying to help my hair after destroying it for years with heat and coloring/dyeing. I simply let my hair air dry and then go.
     Help!!!"
hibroka,j4i8p2,"Some methods like plopping and scrunching don’t work for everyone. 

What products are you using? Making sure they don’t have any bad ingredients is honestly one of the most important steps."
LittlePositive3,j4g3jg,"Alternative to gel&&&I've been doing CGM for a while now (with a 2 month break in which I didn't apply any gel but still did the conditioner etc.) and while I love how my hair looks it just takes way too much time to dry.
I was my hair in the late afternoon, put gel in it (a lot) and plop it for 20 minutes. Afterwards I wear a hair net, the weight of the wet hair + gel pulls down the curls so much that otherwise it just dries up stringly and with only half the curl it could have. A hairnet fixes this problem

But the next morning it's still wet, it takes almost 24 hours to dry completely. Apparently if you don't use gel but instead use kinky curly curling custard, your hair dries a lot quicker. However this product is not for sale in my country. Does anyone have any alternatives?

I have medium thickness hair and a low porosity&&&The mixing with water I never thought off!
Thanks!&&&I've only tried on dry hair. A bit a spaghetti mess and was also really hard.
I'm not sure if mousse will work as it provides only a light hold and to get the hair I want I really need a stronger hold. But I will try anyways. Thanks!"
Mgroenink,j4g3jg,"Definitely use less gel! Everything I was reading about curly hair said to use a lot of product, but for a lot of us waives that’s a disaster. When I was using a lot of gel my hair would pretty much never dry-it was weird, like the water was sealed in. And it weighed my hair down. Try using a really small amount of gel (you can mix it with a little water to thin it and help distribute it better). You can always work your way up if it’s not enough. I also diffuse for maybe 5 minutes just to get a head start on the drying and make sure there’s not too much water weight pulling my hair down. Highly recommend."
WavyChoy,j4g3jg,Have you tried mousse?  You can apply it to your wet hair as the last step for light hold. It’s much lighter than gel
Tansy_Blue,j4dkhg,"Desperately want long hair - do I need protein treatments?&&&After three years of an asymmetrical pixie cut and shaving it all off over lockdown, I am trying to grow my hair as long as possible. I always wanted super long hair as a kid but it never got beyond shoulder length. Now I understand haircare better I'm hoping I can change that. Waist length hair would be an absolute dream.

I'm pretty happy with my hair right now (details below), but I'm wondering if I should add a protein treatment? And if so, how often/which one?

Most days I don't notice any hair fall or breakage at all, although that might change as my hair gets longer, but when I do have a loose hair it doesn't have a root. My ends sometimes seem kind of frizzy - back in the day my ends were extremely frizzy and I always had lots of split ends and flyaways (part of the reason I cut it short!).

**Hair type:** fine, dense, 2b hair that is fairly healthy (i.e. low porosity - never bleached, never coloured, never use heat). Still pretty short, longest bit is about halfway down my neck.

**Wash day routine**

*Pre-wash:* coconut oil on my hair for an hour or so, The Ordinary 7% glycolic acid on my scalp about once a week for the same length of time

*Shampoo & conditioner:* Hask Cactus Water, no particular technique I just try to be gentle with it

*Post-wash:* Olaplex no 6

**No wash days:** nothing in particular but prior to combing I do smooth a little bit of The Ordinary Hemi-Squalane through as a detangler.

(I know this is quite intense for short, healthy hair, but I really want to get past my prior max length!)&&&Waist length is SIGNIFICANTLY longer than I could ever grow my hair before! Like a foot longer. I know I'll need patience, but I'm wondering if protein would help keep the hair I already have in good condition."
m0onlite,j4dkhg,"For long hair you need patience, lots of patience. Hair only grows 0.5 inch per month, so for waist length you'll have to expect to grow for about another 2-3 years and that's if you don't trim in between, which I wouldn't recommend.

Waist length isn't that long though. I'm personally aiming for classic length (just below the butt). That's doable for most people with proper care. The most important thing for growing long hair is damage control. Keep prepoo oiling, moisturize and oil your ends often and trim split ends when you see them. Wear your hair up often and treat it like antique lace. 

Good luck!"
