wavyornot,k85fht,"Daughter's wash day&&&&&&Routine: shampoo with hello bello coconut shampoo (from walmart) and condition with accompanying conditioner. Detangle in sections with lots of conditioner and water, rinse, add Leave-in cantu curl activator. Let sit for a while. Make tendrils with a wet brush I already had, but I used a kind of denman brush technique to make tendrils, then finger coiled and squished them, got rid of excess water with Tshirt, then glazed each clump with a very little amount of gel, and scrunched. Then let air dry. 🙂&&&In case anyone is interested, hello bello is sulfate and paraben free, but does have silicones in it, but I'm not too worried about that as I've heard a lot of different takes on whether or not silicones are actually bad for hair. (Basically from what I understand they're just a synthetic, rather than a natural, occlusive agent , like shea butter for example is a natural one.)"
Blitzedx0,k848va,Same!
Cake_4_Life,k848va,Anyone else have this happen at the end of their braids?&&&&&&Thank you! Sadly its not my natural color. [My Hair](https://www.reddit.com/r/longhair/comments/k7ey7t/getting_a_trim_soon_how_much_should_i_take_off/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
MimiChan00,k848va,"Nope! I wish, Mine looks like a mini broom at the ends once I tie it."
Sylvss1011,k848va,Wow that’s a beautiful hair color!!
_boatsandhoes,k848va,"Same! If my hair is up, it curls .. let it loose.. it's weighed down"
cath_lawr48,k848va,The end of my hair always does this! Wish my whole head would haha
danad1234,k848va,Yes every time!
mermaidslp,k848va,Always. My ponytail also forms one mega spiral.
smil1473,k848va,I love it when my braid does that! Typically only the first braid after a wash though.
wavyornot,k848va,My daughter's hair does that
xsxpxixdxexrxsx,k848va,Almost always if I leave enough hair at the end. I quite like it.
headskittydone,k83thc,"Yes, you definitely seem to have wavy hair. This is a lot what mine looks like if I just use a cream/light mousse. I need to use a pretty high strength hold product if I want to get my waves to last past the first day. I also find diffusing gives me much tighter waves since the water isn’t weighing them down as they try. You’ll have to find what works for you and your hair, but you’re wavy!"
lemonadewhore,k83thc,"it looks like you have very light waves, super pretty"
melontini,k83thc,"Do i have wavy hair?&&&&&&Yeah its pretty thick so it makes sense that it can get weighed down without stronger product, thank you for replying😄&&&Ill try that thank you!  I have noticed that when it rains it gets a lot wavier (if you get past the frizz haha)&&&Thank you!!"
wavyornot,k83thc,"Yes, that's wavy. You could try bringing some definition back to your hair on day 3 by spritzing a little water into the hair and gently scrunching."
clocktopustheoctopus,k7xy7q,"I’ll probably go to a curl specialist, but my diy reset cut wasn’t too bad&&&&&&Wash day- suave clarifying shampoo. Part hair in 4 sections ( down the middle and ear to ear) to wash scalp ONLY. 
Condition with suave coconut conditioner. 
Finger detangle with head upside down. For some reason this is a game changer. If I have a dreadlock forming, I’ll brush it with a ton of conditioner in while water is running over my hair, but that only happens like once every couple of weeks. 
Style with Aztec healing clay. One tablespoon diluted in one cup of water. Pretty much just fill a bowl with water and dunk your head in. Rinse off after the amount of time to shave legs. Plop with a t shirt or microfiber towel. Air dry."
bearsbeats808s,k7x672,Your hair looks great!! Are you applying upside down at any point in your routine? Conditioner/styler
eclo99,k7x672,Sooo pretty!! So you sleep in a microfibre hair towel over night? Is your hair dry by the morning?
ihateolivesalot,k7x672,"Developing my routine and the mane seems to like it ❤&&&&&&I think I have fine, high density, medium porosity, long hair with 2b/2c waves. I've tried so many products, decided recently to go back to the basics and start over. This is the routine I've developed so far, and the 2 week difference from starting fresh to now. 

1) Current routine is Garnier Whole Blends Castor Oil Remedy shampoo (1/week) and conditioner (co-wash 1/week between washes), comb through hair with wet brush to distribute and always S2C. Rinse out conditioner with cool water and leave a small amount in hair for slip.

2) Quarter sized amount of Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie to soaking wet hair, praying hands and squish to distribute product and squeeze out the excess water. 

3) Plop in microfiber hair towel overnight, then good to go in the morning. Satin pineapple between washes, satin pillowcase to minimize frizz.

I think my hair looks healthier, clumping better. It likes the protein in the Shea Moisture product.

Edited to add: details.&&&Hi, yes I sleep with a microfiber towel on and yes, hair is usually dry by morning. I try to squeeze out excess water before plopping so it isn't sopping wet when I go to bed."
Daisyfay1414,k7ut64,AG cloud mousse
acidSlumber,k7ut64,Try Zotos All About Curls Boosting Foam. It barely has a scent and it dissipates pretty quickly. I’m with you with the fragrance issue. There are so many things I can’t use because of the smell.
ndhewitt1,k7ut64,"low scent or more natural scented mousse and foam recommendations&&&I'm looking for foam and mousse recommendations. I use foam or mousse as my only hold styler. I love the way the herbal essences one works, but the scent bugs me. I can't do the fake scents, I think. So, things like NYM curl talk and NYM naturals really bother me after an hour or so. I love aveda scents but their foam has glycerin in it, and I live in a place with high dew points all the time."
pilfernoodles,k7ut64,have you tried Pantene? Their mousse gets a lot of great reviews but I don’t think the smell is too strong.
whosthatgirl159,k7ut64,The Giovanni foam mousse has little to no scent at all! I believe it doesn't have glycerin either
QueenCeeee,k7ky4i,"How it started vs. now (1 month in). I feel like I get better with every wash day! Finally figured out that my hair needs moisture and I wasn't using nearly enough conditioner.&&&&&&Routine: 
Wash with Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine shampoo, condition with matching conditioner - until it feels completely coated and slimy. Then squish to condish and clip it up for the remainder of my shower before rinsing it out. After the shower I apply L'ange curl care styling cream, do some scrunching, plop in a microfiber towel for 20-40 minutes, and then pixie diffuse.

I've learned that water is KEY for styling for me. Like, by the time I dry off, my hair is already too dry for products so I put it back under the faucet until its soping wet before I scrunch. Helps my hair clump better and cut down on wet frizz. I'm going to try a deep conditioner and leave-in next and I'm hoping that helps even more. 

I haven't had good luck with gel so I've cut it out of my routine. I tried Not Your Mother's curl talk gel in the beginning but it just weighed my hair down and made it look super greasy. Maybe i wasn't using it right. I'm thinking about trying a lightweight mousse instead but it seems to be going fine without a ""holding"" product.&&&Honestly the L’ange cream is the only styling cream I’ve used so far, so I don’t have anything to compare it to. I had great results with their other products before I started going wavy, but they have sulfates and silicones so I had to cut them out. 

I have the Kinky Curly curling custard and Uncle Funky’s Daughter’ curl stimulator coming this week, so we’ll see how those go. I’ll have to add the Shea Moisture curl smoothie to my list!"
feirly,k7ky4i,my hair is almost identical to yours! how well does the l’ange cream work? I just bought some of their other products but I haven’t loved them yet. also have you tried Shea moisture curl smoothie?
GiveMeDickAndCoffee,k7klou,I’m finding that same thing happens when I use the NYM mousse. It’s the first mousse I’ve tried and it makes my hair dull and feels like it’s drying out my hair. I can barely run my fingers through my hair when I use it. Does the strictly curls make your hair dull and difficult to manage?
Sylvss1011,k7klou,Love that moosse!
a_diddle,k7klou,"Loving my new routine!&&&&&&Experimented with a completely new routine and  it turned out great! 

I had previously been using Kristen Ess curly shampoo/conditioner, NYM curl talk gel, plopped and did a gel cast. Got tired of paying for Kristen Ess (even though I loved it) and the gel was leaving my hair so dull and hard to manage. I wear my hair up for work a lot so being able to switch from a messy bun to down again is a must. The gel was not good for that. 

Then I tried the NYM curl talk shampoo (still finishing up a bottle of Kristen Ess conditioner). Continued doing gel casts when styling and experimented a bit with using less gel but still no luck for me. I got some nice spiral curls the first time I used this shampoo, but then my waves started pulling out and going straight. 

On a whim I decided to go to rite aid and Walmart after work a couple days ago and ended up purchasing the products pictured. New Routine was an instant success and I’m so happy! 

Products/Routine:
Wash + Condition with Garnier Whole Blends. This line does have sulfates and silicones but my hair doesn’t seem to mind so far. Didn’t realize this when I bought it- I was sucked in by the phrase “weightless moisture” and forgot to check the ingredients haha. LOVE THIS STUFF. It smells so good and was only $4.99 a bottle. 

Right after washing and conditioning I use the HAIRITAGE LIGHT AS A FEATHER (found at Walmart) leave in conditioner and s2c with my leave in. Scrunched and then Piled my hair up on top of my head. I found this awesome lil clip at Walmart that comes with a suction cup for the shower so you’re always clip ready. 

Once I was out of the shower I scrunched to get rid of some excess water. Micro plopped with a T-shirt then plopped for about 30-40 mins. (My hair is dense and this is the minimum amount of time that works for me). Then used a large handful of the strictly curls mousse to coat my hair, scrunched some more to work it in, and diffused with my babyliss until 80-90% of the way dry. Used the cap to sleep on it overnight. 

Day 1: didn’t have a great hair day because it was raining so I just pulled it into a ponytail and i my waves actually looked really great like that. 

Day 2: still raining so my hair is frizzy but I used a combination water and Renpure Rose Water conditioner mix to dampen my hair and diffused dry for about 10 mins. Used the OGX coconut mist to fight the frizz. (A losing battle.) 

Overall: would recommend all of these products. The leave in is the first one I’ve tried that doesn’t weight down my hair and make it go straight. If you’re not against sulphate and silicones the shampoo/conditioner are a great deal and again moisturizing without weighing down. This is my first time with mousse so I don’t have anything to compare it to. My hair feels soft, smells great, and I love that I can run my fingers through it without getting stuck on gross gelled up waves!&&&Ikr!"
sufferingartist2000,k7klou,I’m most excited that there’s a claw clip that comes with a suction cup lol.
tanyamothertucker,k7klou,Putting that mousse on my try list. I used a sample of DevaCurl mousse (I KNOW) this morning and I really love the bounce and the softness.
citrusmouse,k7j55e,"Wavy baby! The difference one month makes. (Same pjs too whoops)&&&&&&Routine!

Wash with palmers coconut oil formula shampoo and condition with the same conditioner.  
Detangle my hair with my fingers with the conditioner in upside down. Rinse, squish it a bit and plop for about 30 mins. Squish in a bit of the got2be twisted mousse and spray with a bit of heat protector in too. I don’t have a diffuser so I’m using my hairdryer and a sieve to diffuse and dry a bit hehe it works fine! Then I clip it up when it’s about half dry and a bit crunchy, just at the roots. Once it’s completely dry I scrunch in some Aussie ‘calm the frizz’ oil."
dontincludeme,k7j55e,"I bought a sieve specifically to make flaxseed gel, but I haven’t made it/used it yet. Glad to know the sieve can have multiple uses lol"
justletmepostplz,k7j55e,Like a sieve from the kitchen? Genius! 😂
Wavvybabbt,k7habg,"Wavy hair hitting its stride!&&&&&&Routine: Shampoo and condition with Pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner (almost daily). Finger comb into locks while rinsing. 

Scrunch upside down, plop in a t shirt for 20 mins.

Scrunch in Curls curl cream and then a touch of the blue bottle gel (not my favorite but I'm trying to use it up). Let air dry, scrunching periodically. 

Once a week I wash with a clarifying shampoo with SLS and deep condition with Blueberry Bliss. It smells like candy. 

Occasionally I'll do a rice water rinse or Oleoplex.

*********

I tried the CGM for a couple months but found my fine hair hated the cowash situation. My hair was always dry or greasy, or some bizarre combination of the two, and my scalp itched like a bitch. I cycled through a ton of different cowashes and finally gave up, recently deciding that I'd use shampoo and conditioner and it would be okay. It turned out amazing. My hair is so happy to have silicones again, I'm not greasy, and most importantly, my scalp isn't constantly itchy!

CGM is obviously not one size fits all, though that seems to be the normal conversation surrounding it. I'm okay with washing daily, my hair actually seems a lot happier, and I'm not stressing about it.&&&Thank you, that is very kind of you."
hannibe,k7habg,"You’re a very pretty person, hair included."
mamamimi2020,k7ce6p,"Ignore my face🤣 but I've slowly been seeing more definition. Super excited to see where this takes me. But I'm wondering what anyone does for frizzy and greasy hair?&&&&&&Currently using my old products, head and shoulders with whole blends. Brushijg with wide tooth comb with conditioner still in. Than flipping head in shower and clumping. (I'm sure this is where I get frizz but also the most definition) than clump with a cotton t-shirt and air dry."
SuzyW0o,k76w22,"Hi, can anyone tell me what wavy hair type I am? This is just after a shower, letting it air dry.&&&&&&Thanks!"
Wavyhaircare,k76w22,"In the first picture, I'd say the half that's on the left side is primarily 2a while most on the right half or so is more 2B. The 2nd picture looks primarily 2b with a little bit of 2a mixed in. So I'd say overall you're mostly 2b."
DancingAndrovski,k76oyh,It looks so good!!
Mj0133,k76oyh,Beautiful!
_boatsandhoes,k76oyh,I feel like we may have the same type hair - what denman brush did you use? I'm trying to figure out whether I need less or more pins. My current wetbrush makes my hair look stringy
loathe-entirely,k76oyh,"After many failed attempts, I finally managed to get the hang of the Denman brush technique!!&&&&&&ROUTINE:

Cowashed with the ginger conditioner from The Body Shop, focusing on my scalp. Followed up by squish to condish using half a handful of the banana conditioner also from The Body Shop. Squished for a good five minutes before fully rinsing.

Micro-plopped until my hair wasn’t dripping wet anymore then raked a grape-sized amount of the Umberto Giannini Banana Butter through each half of my hair (love this stuff, really moisturising but it can be heavy so only use a little at a time and add more if needed). Styled using the Denman brush technique as shown [in this video](https://youtu.be/P2r4EhEOz64), scrunching each section lightly upwards once released from the brush and finally glazed my hair with the Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly before diffusing until 90% dry. Put up my hair in a pineapple to sleep and took it down when I woke up the next morning. Scrunched out the crunch and this was the result! Apologies for taking a picture in my work’s toilets, I woke up late so couldn’t take a picture at home haha!&&&Thank you!!"
AmateurPlantMom,k6yql7,"Having trouble finding the right routine. Is my hair just too straight?&&&&&&Thank you!! That is so nice to hear. I also just grew out my undercut lol. What a journey that it. 

I’ll try to be patient 😭&&&I do not and I realize that would probably be helpful to compare! I will follow up after my next wash day. 

After doing some more digging I’m wondering if my hair is lacking protein and is over moisturized.&&&I’ve always been frustrated with my hair and recently started looking into the CGM about a month ago to see if I could encourage some natural texture. And roughly this is what I’ve been doing:

1. Reset with suave daily clarifying (I only do this when my hair is especially oily or if I’ve been using more products than usual) OR low Poo with tressemme repair & protect 7
2. Co wash with tressemme botanqiue nourish and replenish 
3. Condition with the tressemme and leave in for awhile while I wash my body/shave etc. I’ll squish the hair before rinsing and then rinse most of it out.
4. So at this point I’ve been trying a few different things: 1. For several weeks I was trying a Cantu curl activator cream followed by a Shea moisture gel (all upside down with wet hair) and then plop in a t shirt for 30-45 min. My hair will take FOREVER to dry. Hours. And was not really looking like anything other than simultaneously wet and frizzy. I figured it was too heavy for my hair after finding the wavy hair subreddit and then I started switching to just the Herbal Essence totally twist mousse. And I was really liking the feel of that more but still felt like it was weighing my hair down not defining anything and making my hair look more messy. I havnt been seeing any hopeful results. 

Recently I had to shower and be somewhere and I did not have time to do the routine and look with my hair a mess so the pictures attached are after a simple shampoo and condition. No product. Hair dried with diffuser. 

I’ve been washing my hair 2-3 times a week low poo co wash for a while. Maybe a year or off an on for a few years. But years of towel drying and curling with a hot iron. That being said I wouldn’t say my hair is very fried and stylists always say my hair looks really healthy... I think it looks kind of dull but it is very soft

My hair is deceivingly thick but the individual strands aren’t too coarse. I just have a lot of hair.  When it’s freshly clean no product(pictured) it’s poofy and annoying and flips out at the ends in all directions. It kind of helmets my head.  I do not brush my hair but when it’s longer it has a habit of tangling.  It takes forever to dry when it’s wet and can tend to get oily but I’ve been doin the low Poo co wash for awhile and it’s adjusted to being able to be washed 2-3 times a week. 

I just don’t know enough and I’m hoping anyone here might have some advice.  Is their hope for waves and texture? Or is my hair just straight and I’m in denial. Then the frustration is that it’s never actually straight unless I flat iron because it’s so poofy and flippy!

Could what little wave I have only really show once my hair is longer? Is that a thing? Ive had mostly short hair for years now but I’m growing it out."
Wavyhaircare,k6yql7,"Do you have pictures of your hair when you had tried using the gel or mousse? I'd be curious to see those if that's not a weird thing to ask, haha. To me these pics look like wavy hair that just needs support from a product with hold, but I saw you said that you felt like your results with products that had hold weren't ideal so I thought maybe seeing those would give me more insight. 

Anyway I think you definitely have some natural texture. :)"
pulang_panda,k6yql7,"Oh, that's definitely texture. I had significantly less than that when I started, to the point it looked pin straight, and now I've got these graceful loose bends :) I bet you have a Lot of texture potential!

 I can relate to your frustrations—I didn't realize my 'weird flippy ends' were burgeoning waves until I spent 2+ years growing out an undercut pixie, and my hair finally hit lob length. I'll be 3 years from the pixie in February (4 months since CGM) and my mixed textures are just starting to cooperate. Give it time! As you learn more about your individual hair needs, and the hair itself grows out, I'm sure it'll become more defined :)

Good luck from one new wavy to another!!"
iluvcults,k6vj9o,"Six month difference of not brushing, using leave in conditioner, and diffusion!&&&&&&Routine: wash hair, apply leave in conditioner- this time also used Marc Anthony curl lotion, and then diffused."

Blue_Turtle_18,k6s3r7,"How do others get volume and curl definition at the root?&&&&&&Root clipping doesn't do much for me either...unless I'm doing it wrong&&&My routine:

Shampoo: Desert Essence Tea Tree Shampoo (I also use As I Am Dry & Itchy Scalp Care shampoo and Curl Smith pre-biotic primer and probiotic scrub, I rotate these)

Conditioner: Rizos Curls Deep Conditioner

Stylers: Rizos Curls Curl Defining Cream, Camille Rose Curl Maker

Styling application: Praying hands method and raking, plopped \~10 mins, air-dried and SOTC with \*tiny bit\* of Righteous roots oil (I also sometimes do wet plopping and diffuse although diffusing hurts my back)

I deep condition every two weeks and also do a protein treatment every 6 weeks."
Pey777,k6s3r7,"Omg I’ve been wondering the same thing (my last post was literally this but a lot wordier, haha)
