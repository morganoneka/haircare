E3-NotTheConvention,ib4fy6,"Hi, Mexican here with some experience in CG friendly products. Since the list on the sheet was so poor when I started (I don't know how it looks these days) I started to investigate and found some CG products that worked.

The most important thing I learned is that hair porosity and texture is really important. I have fine thin hair with high porosity so my hair can take products in easily but struggles with lock in moisture.  If your hair is thicker or has normal to low porosity you can theorically take heavier products.

 With that in mind , and with searching for the list of ingredients on certain products I found some things that helped my hair. (You can check if a product is CG friendly by putting the ingredient list on [Is if CG?](http://isitcg.com) ) Here is a small list of what I've tried and what have worked for me:

*Note: I don't do co-washing so I don't know how good  any of the following products work for that purpose

Low-poo/No-poo shampoos:

-Girls with Curls Shampoo. Liked it, but it was too heavy for my hair and after months of use my scalp started to feel clogged.

-Shea Moisture Jamaican Castor Oil Shampoo. Totally not what I thought in a bad way, it let my hair greasy. Might work better for 3b/3c curls

-Love beauty and Planet Shea butter Shampoo. My HG by now. Soft and lets my hair shiny

-Hask Argan Oil Shampoo. Wasn't heavy but I had to use a lot in order to feel that it was actually cleaning my hair. It wasn't anything special.

Conditioners:

-Tresemme with  coconut and aloe vera conditioner (I don't remember it's name hehe). I started the method with this one, it was nice and it lasted forever (the bottle is huuuge) but It didn't help with the frizz so much

-Shea Moisture Jamaican Castor Oil Conditioner. Thought I had just bad luck with the shampoo. I was wrong. It smells like play doh and has a weird texture. Didn't do anything to my hair.

- Garnier Hair food with Aloe vera. The one I'm currently using. Smells good, is lightweight, moisturizing and can use it as a leave-in too. I'm liking it

Gels/mousse

-Herbal Essence's Jazmin mousse for curly hair. (Don't remember the name but it's the red one). I couldn't use it by its own because while it helped to define my waves, it let my hair feeling slightly dry. I had tu use a gel first in order for it to work out. 

-Gel Xtreme. Yup that money-saving little gel is CG approved! It was helpful when I was first starting and it left no residue at all, but I think it's texture can benefit curly hair more than it can to wavy.

-Garnier Fructus Style Curl Treat Jelly. It has a really curious texture but I like it, it does generates a cast like gels do (which is ideal if you're into the scrunch to crunch technique) but I feel it more hydrating than a gel if that makes sense. It's not too heavy or too light for my hair, I love it! 

For reset shampoo I only use Herbal Essence's Al desnudo shampoo. I haven't felt the need to test others since this one checks all the boxes for it and it's really cheap!


So that's it, sorry if it's too much! I hope this helps :)"

Swimming-Painter,ib4fy6,"Wavy hair redditors in Mexico what products do you recommend?&&&Hi! Im new to this community and am reallly exited to try the cg method, but can't find the products recommended. And in the international list, there are no options that I know of.  Can someone in Mexico recommend any other besides those in the list?

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance!&&&Thank you so much!"
NVRgnaGVuUP,iawb9e,I have fine low porosity hair with 2a/b type. When I air dry my hair it's more 2a and gets flat throughout the day. When I use a diffuser to dry completely I get 2b curl even some solid spirals that don't go flat later in the day.
anoril-,iawb9e,"Still baffled at the fact my hair is not straight&&&&&&My hair: fine, 1C-2A (with some strong 2B waves hiding somewhere), high porosity and obviously I am getting it color treated every 6 weeks. 

My routine: 

I use a low poo drug store shampoo and their conditioner. Both is CGM approved. 
I detangle, STC, rinse and then add some curling lotion and scrunch some more. Before I add gel I dry my hair a bit (until not sopping wet anymore) gently with an old shirt. 
Usually I use the praying hands method when applying product. 
I use quite a lot of gel and as you can see it isn’t all scrunched out. 

This is all  very much new to me and I’ve only been doing this for 3 weeks. My hair has never been this moisturized and my scalp isn’t as greasy anymore. 
Can’t believe everyone told me my hair is pin straight my whole life. 
Thanks to this Reddit and some YouTube videos I finally got the courage to try and see if my hair is wavy and I think it’s going there. 
I think I’ll need to let go of some length so my hair will be able to get even more wavy. 

It might sound stupid but I am in fact a bit scared to tell my hairdresser I have been experimenting and fear she might tell me it’s all an illusion. 

If you have any tips I’d love to hear them! I am looking for just encouraging my hair to get wavy (some strands are being rogue).&&&Thanks for the tip! 

I don’t have a diffuser yet but I am looking into getting one since air drying isn’t suitable if I wanna get out of the house quickly."
WeAreStarless,ial6rq,"i have some non-dandruff scalp issues, and i've been loving as i am's dry & itchy shampoo!"
bananaslings94,ial6rq,What about dandruff?&&&Does anyone have any recommendations for shampoo and conditioner when you have severe dandruff?
ericat713,ial6rq,"If you feel like you've tried everything and nothing works....try Nizoral. It's anti-fungal dandruff shampoo. Little pricey but my bottle lasts for a long time. Once I use it, I don't usually need it again for a few weeks."
ftr-mmrs,ial6rq,I don't have dandruff. But Dollar Tree has two CGM compatible sulfate shampoos. You could try using as a weekly reset wash.
placemat24,ial6rq,I have bad dandruff. I use Denorex shampoo firstly. Im switching to a higher strength soon because I still flake some. Then I use Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioner.
saltinado,ial6rq,"I have mild dandruff, and it's definitely improved by one of those little silicone scalp scrubby things."
BadCGHairDay,ial0pe,"Hair wavy waves wet, straightens as dries. What is going wrong?&&&I have been watching Curly Susie's channel today (saw it recommended over on r/curlyhair) and I noticed that my hair looks ALOT like hers when when our hair is wet (for example, this video, after she has applied gel at about time 3:30 https://youtu.be/Faf-m7v_HNw). However, while her hair gains volume as it dries, mine falls and ends up straighter as it dries (even with varying amounts of gel). Is this an indication my hair isn't as wavy as I hope it is, or that it has good potential but I am doing something wrong?

Thanks for your advice!&&&Would you recommend a wig or hair cap for air drying? I have been plopping for half an hour or so, and then I take my hair down because the fabric is too wet to pull anything else out of my hair.
Are there any protein masks or other products that have worked well for you?&&&Air drying. I havent used heat on my hair in 5 years.  Any advice on how I can improve the air drying process?"
briezayy,ial0pe,"Are you diffusing or air drying? If air drying, it could be that the weight of the water is pulling your hair straight."
cinematicstarlet,ial0pe,"I’ve also had the same experience. Wavy when wet, dries straight. Gel helps a little but I rarely use gel. I’ve upped my protein lately and it didn’t improve for me. Maybe it’s a humidity thing? Do you live somewhere very humid?"
disheveledmedic,ial0pe,"Mine does the same thing. I've tried all kinds of gels in varying amounts. I've tried curl creams, different amounts of leave in conditioner, mousses, scrunching, raking, praying hands, and even diffused it multiple ways. Still, my hair is straighter when dry. Maybe it's an issue with protein deficiency? That's what I'm trying next."
rightetighte,ial0pe,"Try aloe vera gel, like the stuff you keep in the fridge for sunburns. It's...wow. I almost gave up on gel altogether and decided to try it one day while my SO was applying it to their pink legs. It's light (hello volume) and NOT sticky! I live in a very humid area, so any other gel seems to mix in with my sweat and make things...swampy."
yougoglencocox,ial0pe,"A few things I've noticed weigh down my hair which may help.     

1.heavy products, anything with shea butter, cocoa butter, coconut oil. I like the NYM seaweed line so far.    
2.Hair stays wet too long; that will weigh it down more. You can diffuse or use a bonnet dryer attachment to help. A wig cap/hair net can help keep it up while drying too. I always squeeze out excess water with a microfiber towel (gently) after applying my gel to soaking hair.    
3.Hair is too thick/heavy; I recently got a shag for this reason and it has helped a TON.    
4.Not enough protein (as mentioned earlier).    
5.Not enough gel.   
6. Not clarifying enough; I tend to clarify once monthly with suave daily shampoo."
FrankxOliveira,iaky65,maybe shes born with it ;)&&&&&&You'd have to message u/PresforPrez for her to see that comment lol&&&All natural
presforprez,iaky65,"thank you so much!!!!&&&lmaoooo so um, as far as haircare goes...   
i wash my hair with l'oreal elvive restoring shampoo, and condition with head & shoulders supreme nourish.  
afterwards, on damp hair - I apply coconut whipped cream leave-in conditioner and brush through lightly with a comb  
after allowing my natural curly hair to dry a lil more (not totally), I apply a small amount of l'oreal elvive smooth intense frizz taming serum and chi silk infusion to my ends.   
I blowdry the top layer of my hair on the coolest setting with a curling brush to tame all the frizz that my hair naturally has... and if my hair is being particularly annoying that day, I will use my flat iron to go in and lightly straighten any excessive curls."
pulang_panda,iaky65,Your fringe goes so well with the flowy waves!
teenagegumshoe,iaky65,People go to salons to get blowout hair like this
BlackWhiteStriped,iajbjc,I have the same problem! My waves start more than halfway down my hair no matter I much I scrunch my hair
Noufah,iajbjc,If my hair look like that hun I will change nothing
Sylvss1011,iajbjc,That’s just how wavy hair works. It starts around the ear. Only curly hair starts at the root
VintageWitchcraft,iajbjc,"So I I think you should try finger coiling the hair on top of your head, the crown area. It'll help give you more definition for the root and overall more definition throughout your wave pattern. 

But I do think your hair looks very nice. It actually looks a lot like mine (I have a little bit more curl towards the bottom) my roots are super straight. I go ahead and look at the positive, tidy roots!

I saw a couple YouTube videos of people doing two strand twists to their hair with Olaplex number 3. It strengthens the bonds in your hair and when you do two strand twists, while leaving the treatment on, it encourages more definition."
_katiekatiekatie_,iajbjc,"You could try drying using the hammock method. Here’s a [video](https://youtu.be/MBkaec34Vkg) on how to do it. I’ve only done it once because it was a bit tedious trying to get my dryer to hold still and I gave up once my roots were dry but I did have waves closer to the root than normal! For reference, my waves normally start about ear/chin range and I had some waves about one or two inches from the root when I did the hammock method."
dianacakes,iajbjc,"How do I get my hair to a) have waves closer to the root and b)have more definition? I love the waves at the bottom, I just want more!&&&&&&Thank you! I'm going to try this!&&&Thank you!&&&For this wash day I washed with Not Your Mother's Curl Talk shampoo, conditioned with Tresemme Botanique conditioner with 7 drops of NPF, brushed through a tiny bit of Curls Blueberry Bliss leave in with a wet brush, applied Aussie Instant Freeze Gel both right side up and upside down and scrunched, NYM Curl Talk mousse same way, and Harry's Gel the same way. Wet plopped 10 minutes, dry plopped 20 minutes. Hover diffused til partly dry, then pixie diffused to 99% dry. 

This was a new product lineup that I was hoping would give me mega hold because I spent several hours outside in the humidity. I do think it was maybe a bit too heavy for my hair. If I only pixie diffuse, my waves are wonky and not uniform. If I only hover, they are very elongated. My wave pattern just might be too long and my hair too heavy to hold it closer to the root, I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips!"
dilf314,iajbjc,"this ^^ except I would use kinky-curly custard instead bc most shea moisture products are too heavy for wavy hair.

also know that wavy hair in general doesn’t start as close to the root as curly hair.

also make sure to really scrunch your hair while applying your stylers!!!"
fluffysuccy,iajbjc,"I use Shea moisture curling custard (scrunched on soaking wet hair, warmed and rubbed between my hands first to emulsify it) and then add gel on top of it.  I feel like it really helps my curls stay put.  I last used the aussie instant freeze gel and liked it, but this time I bought the blue LA sports gel and actually love it better.  The hold I get with the 2 products together really lasts and holds well on multiple days out of the pineapple.

I find when I don't use the custard my curls are less towards the top."
frannyrosewater,iajbjc,"Have you tried clipping? I know it’s for root volume but it will probably help with the desired effect of fuller wavier hair. I’ve never actually tried it myself but lots of people swear by it. I’ve also found that my root waves are a lot more defined when I have shorter, thinned out hair. When my hair is long and super thick there’s a noticeable difference at my roots.&&&I have 2b waves that start at the root without any fancy techniques or coaxing. I think plenty of wavies have root waves it just depends on the person!"
josiefolland,iajbjc,"To have your waves closer to the root, I scrunch right to the root with holding gel or curl creme and then just mess it around at my scalp with my fingers."
otter_annihilation,iajbjc,"A couple thoughts:

Personally, I prefer to use mousse after plopping, right before diffusing. I find it gives more definition and a smidge more hold.

Second, a curl enhancer might be a good addition.  As I Am Curling Jelly is my fav, but Kinky Curly Curling Custard is very similar and doesn't have glycerin. 

I did wet plopping for a while but then dropped it. I found it didn't do anything beneficial to my hair and often tended to give my wet hair time to weigh itself down (even up in a shower cap). I get more consistent results just dry plopping. 

Finally, how I ruled out wet plopping was I did several weeks where I would take notes on my phone of what I did each wash day (products AND techniques), and I only changed one thing each day or two. It was super hard to resist trying all my new products at once, but it really helped me isolate what worked for me and what didn't. I highly recommend it!"
sassysassysarah,iajbjc,"That gel gives me 0 hold. My hair absolutely hated it. It also hates the curl talk line except for the scalp cleansing oil, which is now a hg for me 

I'm just gonna go full trouble shooting mode lol: Could it be all the protein/not enough moisture (since you're using a tonnnnn of protein)? Have you clarified in a while? Could you he using a product that's too heavy? Could you possibly also be sensitive to aloe? Or could it be a little curl shock if it's a whole new lineup? Have you masked in a while?"
Xena0422,iah1dr,Both.
saylo_halo,iah1dr,"mousse or gel?&&&

DarthPandaSocks,iagg56,"We have a similar texture. I've actually found that scrunching doesn't work super well for me. It actually breaks up my clumps. I've heard that application can make or break your routine more than the products you use.



Instead, I sometimes apply a small amount of leave in (change as you need - my hair is always over moisturized so I can skip leave in) on sopping wet hair with praying hands/glazing. I gently squeeze some excess water out. Then, I glaze gel into my hair and I only scrunch the ends very, very gently. At this point, I use my denman brush to fix the bits near my face.


Finally, I dry gently with a microfiber towel - again avoid a scrunching motion. It's more like praying hands but dabbing with a towel. I only air dry because I won't turn my hair dryer on in a heat wave. This can leave my roots kinda flat, but a gentle fluff fixes that.


Edit: I noticed you're using some Shea Moisture products. Many wavies find that brand to be too heavy/emollient for their hair, with some exceptions of course. Heavy products can absolutely get in the way of clumping. Maybe nix the SM for something lighter?"
ants-in-my-plants,iagg56,"What kind of diffuser are you using? The first diffuser I tried was a Conair one that I got at a CVS and it was a DISASTER. Frizzy, poofy, terrible. Then I ordered The Bouncer diffuser from Dry Bar and it was a whole different ballgame. If the diffuser you’re using makes your hair blow around when you’re holding it a few inches away, then it’s not a good diffuser. 

Have you tried using a gel instead of a cream? Creams usually leave my hair pretty frizzy. Gels tend to have better hold. Also I find that the longer I plop, the frizzier it gets, so maybe try plopping for a shorter period of time?

Best of luck to you!"
balloony8,iagg56,"Low Porosity 2A/B Hair Help!&&&&&&Hi everyone! I’ve been doing the CGM method for around 6 months, and I need some help!!

I have thin, 2A/B hair that’s very dry and slightly frizzy. I recently discovered my hair is low porosity, which explains why my hair takes half a day to dry. I find my hair hard to clump after the shower, and it’s pretty limp after air drying so I’m definitely looking for more volume, but diffusers have so far just made me very frizzy. I’ve really been struggling, so if anyone has anyone advice or products or routines I should try, please let me know!! All the products I found online for low porosity hair were catered towards type 3/4 hair, so I’m not sure what to use. 


My current routine: Shampoo with MopTop Gentle Shampoo and squish to condish upside down Mop Top Light Conditioner. Once a week I’ll clarify with Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo and use the SheaMoisture Coconut Oil Rehydration Treatment Mask. Then I scrunch Curlsmith Weightless Air Dry Cream and Curlsmith Hold Me Softly Style Balm upside down into soaking wet hair. I plop for around an hour with a T-shirt, air dry, then scrunch out with Argan oil."
S4mm1,ia9ry6,"My hair is short, so I use a foaming dry shampoo on my roots. When my hair was longer I'd put my upper layers in a bun and leave the lower layers down."
alexpuppy,ia9ry6,Dry shampoo does cause build up. On greasy roots days I've been doing a loose french braid.
bogginis5,ia9ry6,"I used to use dry shampoo but now I just use a makeup brush. Dip it in arrow root and put it on my roots before I go to bed. I used to have super greasy hair, but once I stared using better products and arrow root it’s gotten a lot better"
nicole_pkelly3,ia9ry6,Hairstyle Ideas&&&Hey folks! I get quite greasy roots literally from Day 2 hair onwards. What updos/half updos do you all style your hair with on your refreshed waves but greasy roots? Washing my hair every other day but could stretch it to a third if I can find a way to style it! Would use dry shampoo too but does it cause build up?
FloraFit,ia8dll,"Deep conditioning is a process, that process can be achieved by any number of products and techniques including hair masks. Whether the mask you’re using does a good job of that, I’m not sure because I’ve never used it. Personally I like to leave masks on for t least an hour if not overnight, but YMMV."
GuinnessGirl50,ia8dll,"I think it depends on what your hair needs, but unless your hair is suffering from overmoisturization, a protein treatment can be drying to hair unless balanced out by a moisturizing conditioner. 

I tend to think of protein treatments as different from ""deep conditioners,"" which may include protein but also tend to have more moisturizing ingredients."
Old-Neighborhood-792,ia8dll,"Deep conditioning&&&I have fine 2a hair. I hear you are suppose to deep condition once a week. I will use my norm shampoo which right now is real raw shampoothie argan oil miracle shampoo. Rinse that out and apply a hi pro pac hair mask you can get from Walmart. Put on my plastic cap and a warm towel for 5 mins. That's what most of the mask calls for. Is this considered deep conditioning or just using a hair mask? All comments welcome and thank you guys.&&&I don't think I've found the right one yet. The deep conditioner you get in the loreal preference hair dye boxes does wonders for my hair, but you can't buy them individually. I have the glow habit mosturizing conditioner that makes my hair really soft when I'm washing it out but once it's out there no lasting effects on my hair. I guess I just haven't found the right product yet."

Cat24601,i9tyjt,The curl whip smells amazing!
ChelseaStarleen,i9tyjt,"So excited! The Cake brand items were BOGO 50% off and the NYM was 50% off too! Walgreens for the win! Here's to better hair!&&&&&&So far I love them. The smell is great. The mouse has nice hold and isn't sticky&&&So far I am pretty happy with my purchase. The shampoo has a very strong carrot cake smell, which I love, but some people might not. Even after using the conditioner, mouse and gel I can still smell it. It's strong. The conditioner smells similar, more of a gingerbread cookie smell. The mouse reminds me of lemon meringue pie. All in all they all smell like something I'd eat 🤣

My only complaint so far is that the hole in the dispenser on the conditioner is far too small for the thickness of the conditioner, it takes forever to get out enough. Takes less of that than my other Tresseme conditioner to get my hair slippery and seaweed-y tho. So there is that."
flyingcat_hysteria,i9tyjt,I'd love to know how you find the Cake products! I've been eyeing them for a while but havent heard much about them!
LSDsavedmylife,i9rygk,I had a similar issue until I switched from plopping to “slinky blot” method. It’s super simple! [Video](https://youtu.be/hdFWceE_B24)
mrachelle326,i9rygk,"Finally found a routine my hair will respond to, but when I flip my hair back after plopping, the top flattens.

smokeylavender,i9rygk,"I've watched some youtubers who have mentioned that plopping could cause some flattening. Essentially they said what happens is as you plop, the products in your hair can settle down into your roots weighing your hair down. Most only recommend plopping no more than 30 min. I have super fine and flat hair and now i just micro plop instead of full plop. I might plop for like 10 min while I put on makeup.

I've also seen people using those mini flat clips that stylists use to hold a curl in place while it cools, but they clip it at their roots when their hair is 80-90% dry then take out when 100% dry. I tried it once but the clip got tangled in my hair and I had to pull it out and it was a mess so I'm too scared to try again. But something like that might help you out too"
bsurrett7,i9runa,"she has such a pretty wave pattern!!! starting taking care of curls young is sooo important, i wish someone close to me would have known what to do with my hair when I was that little. so sweet of you to help her out!! 

try not to plop overnight too often especially if it’s wet, doing that every night can cause bacteria to grow on the scalp. instead you can do the routine in the morning and plop for 10-15 minutes, and try having her sleep in a satin bonnet or wrapping it in a silk scarf when it’s dry :)"
