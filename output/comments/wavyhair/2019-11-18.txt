Sharkelberryfinn,dzd4ke,I also vote 2a 2b mix
Susszm,dzd4ke,"I think it’s 2a 2b with potential for 2b2c, with the right products"
farmerbrit,dzd4ke,I would say 2b/2a mixed. I have similar hair myself.
heyleyy20,dzd4ke,"What's my wave type?&&&I have looser waves on the opposite side but here's the majority of my hair unbrushed and air-dried. Thanks! I keep getting confused if I have 2a, 2b, or 2c.

WeAreStarless,dyjjfe,"hard to tell when it's this short, but i assume you're 4c"
devanimate,dyjjfe,What is my hair type?&&&&&&I got a another photo with bigger hair --->  [https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/dyiq9s/hair\_gets\_curly\_when\_wet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/dyiq9s/hair_gets_curly_when_wet/)&&&turns out I'm 3c/4A I finally used a conditioner and a curl cream and It made my hair spiral S pattern
heyleyy20,dyjjfe,"Looks mostly 4c, could have some 4b."
Fatty-Magoo,dya0k4,"Awesome!

We seem to have similar hair. What’s your routine? I’m just off the wagon with modified CG, because I really like being able to touch my hair, but would love to know how you’ve achieved such gorgeous results!"
QueeniJazz,dya0k4,"Update on wavy journey 😮&&&&&&I’ve been trying to do the same routine from when I started. But I’ve changed the amount of product, more or less. I only do conditioner(sometimes shampoo but not often), then I scrunch while I’m in the shower.
After the shower,  I put in “leave in conditioner” plus hair gel, scrunch it in. Then I take t-shirt and scrunch more😂
I scrunch a lot, upside down, on the side.  When it’s not dry but not wet-wet(damped), I let it air dry. 
Sometimes I leave coconut oil in my hair over night or hair mask thing. My hair loves that and makes it wavier😁&&&I’ve bleached mine too. I had really long hair, down to the hips. But then I bleached it and had to cut it. A few months later, I saw some curls. I’ve always had wavy hair in the shower, I just though it was normal. 
But then I saw curly hair routine, my first thought “nah I don’t have curly hair. But I will try just for fun”. And yeah now I have wavy hair😂 
Just keep going, some days are bad and some a good"
lalucerossa,dya0k4,"I have similar hair texture as well. I've got really bleach damaged hair, though, so I suspect I'm working with hair that isn't at it's peak, already. It's incredible to see your progress in the last few months! I think about quitting and putting a blowdrier to my hair every once in a while and seeing your progress inspires me!"
