syd_ann96,fblhk1,"Tips for refreshing wavy hair?&&&Help! I am going out tonight, but I just washed my hair yesterday and it's a complete frizzy mess from a windy day. Any tips on refreshing?"
Canuckinfortybelow,fbkvm3,"I‚Äôd say definitely wavy. Too soon to say curl type but could easily end up being 2b. I also have a hard time with the cgm. I would honestly recommend starting with just not brushing your hair dry, squishing and scrunching product into hair, and air drying or using a diffuser. For products I would recommend a curl cream of some sort, and a gel or mousse. For brands I would just go to your local drugstore and see what they have and look up reviews online to see if they are good. I personally don‚Äôt see much point for waives going full cgm right in the beginning.

Also some good youtubers are ‚Äúcurly Susie‚Äù and ‚ÄúSwavey curly Courtney‚Äù for your hair type."
_veggieburger,fbkvm3,"Wavy?&&&&&&If so, please give suggestions on where to get started with products because I get kind of lost trying to navigate all things cgm."
LaylaLeesa,fbdep0,That face blur makes you look like an angel from a horror movie.

baileyboo1997,fb3kad,"Devacurl Damage&&&&&&Two months. That‚Äôs all I used it for. 1/2 a bottle of 12 oz Lowpoo Delight, 3/4 of a bottle of One Condition Delight, and not even half of the small bottles of B‚Äôleave In and Volumizing Foam. 
I‚Äôm heartbroken. 
I know it‚Äôs not as bad as some of the others, and my heart goes out to them. 
If you‚Äôre using Devacurl, please, PLEASE stop. Throw it away. 
Routine: Wet refresh with MopTop Daily conditioner and MopTop curly custard."

Matiuso,fb1uh9,"What type of hair do I have&&&Hi !

I've always wondered what type of hair do I have. I've never really been able to figure out myself.

Here's some pictures from some years ago when I had medium length hair. Here you can really see my hair pattern.

nan00shie,fb1uh9,It looks pretty straight to me it could be straight/wavy leaning towards straight
getoutlindsxy,fao1cu,Hi I‚Äôm new here!! This is my first post :) I think my hair ranges from 2a-2c but I‚Äôm not entirely sure. I joined this sub to learn how to take take of my hair better bc I legit know nothing lmfao and my hair looks fried sometimes bc I‚Äôve bleached and colored it a few times.&&&&&&Thank you so much ü•∫ü•∫
pissgender,fao1cu,"deep condition and do a protein treatment asap! you can find quite a few options at your local drug
store. i like shea moisture's deep conditioning treatments and I hear their protein treatment is good as well. if you want to upgrade from drug store stuff, try using olaplex no.3. I also really enjoy ecoslay's banana cream conditioner."
Aasilma,famuiy,I hear they are both very similar. I have the cantu curl activating one and it's ok but not the best for my hair. (I also have bleach damage)
sunnyb1797,famuiy,Cantu or Shea moisture?&&&I‚Äôm just starting to recover my hair after bleaching it about six months ago. I‚Äôm doing Olaplex No. 3 and need a curl cream. I have a curl foam that doesn‚Äôt work and also makes my hair super dry. I‚Äôve heard great things about Cantu and curl defining smoothie. Which is better?? And how to use it??&&&Okay good to know. My hair has lost basically all curl since I got a balayage
anywhereanal,falnqs,Nice! Where do you get moptop?
baileyboo1997,falnqs,"Ditching Devacurl!&&&&&&I had a suspicion that Devacurl might not have been right for my hair, which I hated because I so much wanted it to work. But after doing some research into  their current situation, combined with the fact that my scalp was literally breaking out, I threw out my Devacurl and decided to try MopTop. This is the best washday I‚Äôve had ever, after two months on CGM. 

Routine: MopTop Gentle Shampoo, MopTop Daily Conditioner, MopTop Curly Hair Custard. 

Washed at scalp, conditioned at ends and detangled with a small brush, rinsed out most of the conditioner and used praying hands/scrunching for curly custard application. 

I‚Äôm still really struggling with frizz, and don‚Äôt understand what everyone means when they talk about products having too much/not enough protein. I have 2b-2c waves, with some 3a curls on the bottom layer here and there. Any help/recommendations are appreciated!&&&Thank you! üíïüíï&&&Aw thank you! I was so happy to finally get some definition (and also to find a product that didn‚Äôt weigh my hair down).&&&Thank you!! And honestly like I know it sucks to not finish a product (especially one that expensive), but based on what a lot of people are experiencing, I would definitely stop using Devacurl immediately and clarify your hair. Not worth itchiness and hair loss!&&&So I‚Äôm on day two hair now, after sleeping on a silk pillowcase but doing no refresh (I had to rush out of the house this morning). The waves on top have definitely fallen a bit flat, but underneath I still have some pretty good definition! 
I honestly think I didn‚Äôt use enough of the custard. After only using Devacurl gel and just assuming that my hair just didn‚Äôt like gel, I was VERY conservative with how much I used. I‚Äôm definitely going to use more next time. However, my frizz is WAY less than usual. This is actually the first time I‚Äôve gone out with day two hair just down!"
fashionvomit,falnqs,good for you!
la_reina_del_norte,falnqs,Ayyy! That's so awesome! I'm trying to finish up my devacurl shampoo and conditioner...but it feels too heavy for my wavy hair. I'm currently using Sun Bum and I really love it! Will check out this brand. Thank you!
panu7,falnqs,"Your hair looks a lot like mine. How is the hold on this -- what's it look like at the end of the day?

I live in a humid area, and the problem is that my waves will look great and very similar to yours in the morning when I head out to work, but by lunch they have gotten pretty flat. They don't look bad, just flatter. So I know I need something with hold but I can't figure out what (and don't have the $$$ to try a ton of products)."
sunfloo,falnqs,I love your waves!
_humanERROR_,fadhum,"How would my hair end up if I cut it short?&&&[This](https://imgur.com/nBWostQ) is my shoulder length hair. In the pic it's frizzy cause it was one of my bad days. I've had a lot of problems with it in my life but now I've found products and a routine to make it look decent.

But my main biggest issue is that when getting a haircut, the ends or midsection curls outwards like [this](https://imgur.com/65fLjJ6) (not an actual pic of me). My new hairdresser informed me that some haircuts just aren't good for wavy hair, unless you're prepared to do a lot of work with setting and styling with some sort of heat (which I did not know). She said the best haircut for wavy hair is shoulder-length with a bit of a long side fringe.

Another issue is that my hair has always parted in the middle, and I can never achieve a different parting. My hairdresser told me I should accept it if that's the way my hair wants to stay.

So I've always wanted to get a masculine cut like [this one](https://imgur.com/69oSHS0). I'm prepared to buy styling cream or gel to take care of such a haircut. But I'm scared that my hair will either curl in a very ugly way or will be very straight. My hairdresser said that it might end up pretty wavy because it doesn't have weight holding it down, or it might be pretty straight. And maybe it's a stupid assumption, but I'm scared that my middle parting will stick. Hair that short should not form a parting right?&&&Curious, what hair textures would not be suitable for a cut like that?"
jenniferroses,fadhum,"I think going pixi short would work because most of our waves begin around the ears, you'll be short enough to avoid that flippy part around the ears. If you decide to grow it out, you'll be dealing with flippy for a while. Overall I think the short cut will work very well with your hair texture."
vldsa,fadhum,"You'll have to be going into the salon every 3-4 weeks to get a shave up, so in that sense it's a pretty high maintenance cut. You will need to style it every day or every other day, else it'll look limp and altogether unimpressive. I don't think it was quite right of your hairdresser to say that your part will forever be the way that it is now - you can train your hair to part wherever, it just takes time a few weeks/months to retrain. I think your biggest concern should be the maintenance and eventual grow out period :O"
Majoringinbooks,fa41yj,"Affordable 2C hair routine?&&&I've been scrolling through this subreddit and I couldn't really find any hair routines so I hope making a post will help me out. I have 2C hair and I have never really had a hair routine but I really need one. Any suggestions? Any shampoo,conditioner, products etc. would be so greatly appreciated Thanks!"

morgainz,fa41yj,"For shampoos, Live Clean and Maui Moisture are pretty great. I'm currently also using Joico colour care sulfate free shampoo which I'm liking as a regular cleanser. 

Conditioner will depend greatly on your hair - wavies may find the tresemme botanique too heavy, but lots of people like it. I'm cycling it with biosilk conditioner (just the original one I believe, which has protein). Maui moisture, Shea moisture (specifically the manuka and yogurt line), and not your mother's curl talk are other popular ones.

Leave in conditioners might not be necessary, I haven't really found I've needed them so I don't have a ton of input here.

For styling products, I'm really liking gels (Garnier pure, dippity do girls with curls Gelee, eco style Krystal) but other wavies prefer mousse like herbal essences totally twisted, of the new fav - not your mother's curl talk. Or you could use both!"

SkipBoat,f9zga7,"Unrelated, but I love your nose ring. Did it hurt??"
leafylesbian,f9zga7,"wash day semi-success&&&&&&i got a great gel cast after diffusing, but because i left the conditioner in my hair it got weighed down and fell quickly after scrunching out the crunch. 

routine: cowash with shea moisture manuka honey and yogurt conditioner, rinse, apply ~8 pumps more to condition, squish to condish, no rinse. apply ampro gel to wet hair, microplop out excess moisture, plop 15 min, microplop more then apply gel again, attempted root clipping, diffuse on low/hot for 30 min, then sotc!&&&It‚Äôs a piercing so lol yeah, the initial pain is bearable, the soreness for 3+ months later was the main thing"
Calisteph6,f9xzbv,demi hair dye- keratin&&&Does anyone have experience with this ingredient relaxing their curls?  Should I look for a product that doesn't contain it?  I'm using wella color touch and I notice it has keratin.  Thanks!
WeAreStarless,f9xzbv,"keratin is just a protein. it has a bad reputation because it's used in keratin treatments, which are straightening treatments, but the keratin is not what's doing the straightening, just what they named the treatment after"
Qnzkid91,f9v0ir,"What shampoos/Conditioners do you recommend?&&&Male with thick wavy hair here, had some itchy scalp issues so currently using ketoconzaole 2% for it but my dermo said I could use a shampoo too. Do you recommend anything for our hair type? 

&#x200B;

Thanks!"
Sharkelberryfinn,f9v0ir,"I get flaky scalp most of the year but I've started to think because my hair is so thick it's hard to get the shampoo to penetrate to clean my scalp, and then hard to rinse it out when it does get in there.

I've started using a scalp and shampoo brush in the shower. It seems to help with the above mentioned. They're under $10 on Amazon."
HeavyDoubles,f9ocgo,Best product for really bringing up curls in medium length hair? My hair is fine/low density and gets weighed down easily.&&&I‚Äôm going to get my hair layered again to really encourage curl. What products are your favorites?
pissgender,f9ocgo,I think mousse is a good option. herbal essences totally twisted can be found most places
RadishDerp,f8t5ri,"My hair is just a bit longer than yours and a similar texture. I find I can't pineapple my hair since it turns into a mess. What works for me is to wrap my hair in a satin scarf to protect the curls while I sleep. 

Otherwise, I find I can get a lot more curling from the top if I squish to condish upside down!"
crescentrabbit,f8t5ri,"Thin fine wavy hair, starting process, hair needs help LOL&&&&&&Yes, I can‚Äôt pineapple very well and I‚Äôve been thinking about getting a satin hair bonnet. 

Doing stuff upside down gives me better results! I do my whole hair routine upside actually. The only problem is I haven‚Äôt quite learned the best way to apply stylers, I feel sort of lost there, lol.&&&Hey all, I posted a bit ago about the struggles I had with my hair and was recommended to try the NYM curl talk. I purchased these products and this is the second day hair, I slept with it in a pineapple. My hair is a fuzzy blob, some pieces curling and other pieces doing..... something. Here‚Äôs hoping I get a good end result if I keep going forward with this."
