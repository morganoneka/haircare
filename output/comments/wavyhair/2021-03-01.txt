Now I miss my long hair. I did my 3rd hair donation this fall. I always tell myself that it was for a good cause😂"
DinosaurKale,m07i5y,Your hair is fantastic! I have a similar curl pattern but only like 1/4 the # of hair strands. Totally jealous.
Emmademus,m07i5y,Your hair has got me feeling a type of way. Wow
Greydore,m07i5y,Your hair is absolutely stunning! Maybe I need to stop the gel and start using mousse...
IShouldHaveNoddles,m07i5y,Amazing hair omg omg

MoonlightDragoness,m07i5y,"You got the Targaryen hair, my my

 It's amazing"
MrsRadioJunk,m07i5y,I use nym curl talk after kinky curly knot today (the detangler/leave in). When I used the mousse after other leave ins it can get stickier. When my hair is too dry or I use too much it gets crunchy. So maybe you just need to use a different combo with it?

maegatz,m07i5y,okay but drop the routine! you look amazing!
midnightpanic,m07i5y,I used to say this a lot in HS and no one understood me
mkroar,m07i5y,Amazing! I have the same mousse but I must be using too much of it or something. My hair always comes out sticky/crunchy when using it
mrachelle326,m07i5y,"I'm sooo jealous! Also, your color 😍"
notabigmelvillecrowd,m07i5y,"I find the same, it especially makes my hair really messy and dull the next day.  My hair is so fine, I want mousse to work for me, because gel weighs my hair down, but it makes it so shiny and shake and go for several days, even if it's fairly flat."
oooooshethicc,m07i5y,"I find that mousse so sticky and gross, even after SOTC! Do you have any tips for using it? You have amazing hair 😍"

xchavez,m07i5y,"Here is my wavy hair. I applied just a little bit of not your mothers mousse in damp hair.&&&&&&Thank you very much for the compliment! 🤯😍🤗&&&(I’m available haha ... just saying 😂)You guys are awesome 😍! Thank you very much....I have the biggest smile right now. 😃 Wishing everyone a happy day! 🤗&&&Thank you! 
I get what you’re saying, that’s why I like to apply it on wet hair. .. usually a little goes a long way.&&&I like using gels as well 😉 but if I had to recommend a mousse it will be the  Pop Life Volumizing Mousse by original moxie... that’s my favorite. It leaves your hair with lots of volume and good definition.&&&Haha!  😂😘🤗&&&How nice of you, yes it has gotten long...thank you !!! Sending you the biggest hug 🤗"
mrs_impostor,m06pqz,Gorgeous! 😍
noon4thecorgi,m06pqz,"Ofc my hair looks good when I’m about to go to bed 🤦🏽‍♀️&&&&&&routine - washed with t-gel, realized my hair needed protein so Shea Moisture yogurt and honey protein treatment for 10-15 min, then Pantene Curl Perfection conditioner and combed thru hair w conditioner with a denman brush, formed curl clumps and did s2c. Then rinsed all the conditioner out and scrunched like a madwoman first with hands alone and then a regular bath towel. I parted it down the middle and let it air dry, occasionally flipping from side to side"
Anonymous200002939,m05ocj,How can i make my hair wavy when its short?It only gets wavy when its long.&&&&&&i don’t remember where my waves would start.&&&Will it be possible to make my hair wavy when its short?My hair gets wavy when its wet.
PhilosopherPrimary17,m05ocj,"When your hair was long, where would the waves start on your hair? Sometime people's hair just needs to be longer in order to be wavy. Otherwise, if you just got it cut (in recent weeks), it could just be that your hair needs time to adjust and the waves should come back soon."
artemiscrossing,m05ocj,Most wavy haired people need product to keep the waves intact so I would definitely recommend using a gel or mousse
ChemE611,m03zvt,"Some recommendations/considerations are: 

\- it can be helpful to give hair a break from styling (this happens with me and my hair refuses to cooperate)

\- Shea Moisture can be a bit heavy for some hair types/porosity

\- a protein treatment may be needed!"
Istinline,m03zvt,"Are you protecting your hair while you sleep? Hair protection is probably the biggest step in ensuring your hair has an easy refresh in the morning. 

Your routine does seem heavy but that will all depend on your texture and porosity. You could start by just incorporating one styler over a moisturizing product like a cream or leave in or non at all! 

Do you clarify at all? Product buildup over time could lead your strands to be weighed down. 

Good luck!"
artemiscrossing,m03zvt,"What do you do with it while sleeping? My waves last way longer if I put them up in a pineapple but you can also wear a buff, bonnet, or silk scarf to protect them. Loss of definition sometimes means you need a protein treatment too"
totallynotsarcastic1,m03zvt,"Wavy hair falls flat after sleep, or if I don’t diffuse&&&Basically the title, sometimes I really wonder at all if my hair is actually wavy or if I’m just forcing it to be. It does get pretty loose, big waves but some days if I don’t diffuse after my shower because I don’t have time to it slowly dries and the waves are flatter than usual. Then the next day they’re virtually gone, where I’m left with the slightest curl at the ends of my hair. I had a lot of success in the past and now this has been happening, any advice?

My routine used to be:
- Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Shampoo through the roots 
- Condition with the same Shea Moisture conditioner
- Instead of squishing my hair, I would “plump it” since squishing used to wring out all the moisture from my hair and leave it stringy
- With damp hair, apply a small amount of Not Your Mother’s Curl defining cream on the ends of my hair 
- Plump in a small amount of Herbal Twist Mousse 
- Lightly apply LA looks gel with prayer hands and finally squish out the excess moisture with a t shirt, and I’d plop for 20 minutes before diffusing.
- Clarify once a week with Suave Clarifying Shampoo

This routine has worked really well up until my last few washes&&&I was wondering if I should try a protein treatment, thanks!"
Upbeat_Flounder_1608,m03op1,"Routine recs!&&&Full disclosure I don’t use products, and I air dry. I want to shampoo less often and have a better routine. I’m late to the game! Summer hair is way better than winter hair, though it’s all changing the older I get. I want smoother hair—cut the frizz! 2a/b, low porosity, coarse, thick hair, long hair. Also v sensitive skin. Product/routine suggestions? Co-wash? Thanks!"
elleresscidee,m0392y,"The right side of my head is taking nicely to my new methods. The left side...not so much. So frustrating! The clumps break up immediately when I scrunch, and the whole side always looks more stragly and uneven than the right!&&&&&&Yes! It drives me crazy too! Mine is a mix of 2b/2c, and a few 3c curls have even started to show up recently (only on the right side, of course 😑). My left side is about half 2b/2c and half strands that are almost totally straight. I can sort of make up for it by using more gel and re-scrunching in the morning, but it still always lags behind the other side. Ugh!&&&Oops, typo in title. *Straggly

Today, I clarified with Suave Clarifying Shampoo, then deep conditioned with Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Deep Conditioning Masque. After rinsing, I added Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in to soaking wet hair, scrunched with Tresemme Extra Hold Extra Firm Control Gel and a t-shirt. It is currently air drying.

Edit: also should've mentioned this is right out of the shower and then scrunched. So still very wet. I just wanted to show the difference that starts immediately after washing 😬"
tanyamothertucker,m0392y,I have this issue too. Left side of my head is 2c/3a. The right side is 2b/lazy 2c. It’s less noticeable when if style it with a side part but it still drives me crazy.
hermitjoon,lztcnd,"lightweight low porosity products?&&&I started my natural hair journey ~9 months ago and have made minimal progress since. This is partly because I was using a slightly modified CGM and my hair did not like the lack of silicones, but also because at the beginning i bought almost exclusively shea moisture products and while they are working well for protein/moisture, they are weighing my hair down a TON. 

i’m looking for lightweight products to use - my hair goals are both volume and definition but slightly catering towards the latter (also should note - my top priorities are as little frizz as possible and hair that i can run my hands through as i’m adhd and often stim via my hair). i’m not protein sensitive but would particularly like to have a leave-in without it or with it near the bottom of the ingredients list (i have the curls blueberry reparative leave-in which i like, but when i have too much protein..). i do also prefer mousse over gel, and live in canada, so keep that in mind ig ?

curl type: 2a/2b (again my hair is weighed down atm so this is possibly not accurate) 
porosity: low (i have a bit of confusion surrounding this as i’ve undergone bleaching ~4 times in the last 5 years, but my hair beads and takes 8-9 hours to dry so i’m running with it)
thickness: fine, medium near the roots
density: high/dense

tl;dr lightweight hair products for 2a/2b, low porosity, fine/medium thickness, high density + non-protein-sensitive curls&&&ohhh that’s what the sprays are - i’ll look into NYM and innersense for sure.

the herbal essences totally twisted mousse is for some reason not available in shoppers (the canadian cvs/walgreens basically) but i have incidentally found i can get a 3 pack on amazon.ca for 9 bucks, so it’s definitely accessible. i’ve never been able to get a cast so it’s definitely something to try.

(edit: added a bit)"
snarktini,lztcnd,"For light leave-ins, choose ones that spray -- NYM has two (pink + yellow bottles, no protein) and Innersense has one (w/ protein) that I've used successfully. Personally, it's best for my hair to use protein in my rinse-out products and avoid it in leave-in stylers.

The Herbal Essences Totally Twisted mousse works well for me and is easy to find in the US. (I have no idea what you can or can't get in Canada.) It takes hours off my dry time compared to gel. It does make my hair crispy and that has to be scrunched out.

If your hair takes that long to dry it's almost definitely low porosity."

Mama-anom-nom,lzrjgr,My hair does this sometimes when I put it up in a loose lazy bun. Those are fun mornings =)
Mezbelike,lzrjgr,"Hope guys can post here too 😅 I left my hair in a bun all day and slept in it and here’s the results after taking it down. No products used in my hair.

Omg lolol yes....for almost 20 years people have told me that and that was when I even had short hair. Or I look like someone they know or like an ex.&&&It depends how long I’ve had it up for. Sometimes I do if I’m taking my hair down after it being up for a couple days straight. I posted a video on how I do it. Maybe that will help.&&&Thank you!! I’m glad you like it so much!! I’ll be sure to post more. I’ve never had a picture get so much attention! I also didn’t see any guys posting here so I wasn’t sure if that was allowed.

Gir_123_,ly7fof,"Hairy jayne do amazing shampoo bars and because of their ingredients they are an acidic bar (a lot are usually alkaline) you don't need to rinse with ACV.

 I've just written a blog about my thoughts all about my experience with it :)
[Hairy Jayne floral shampoo bar blog ](https://hookandizerowaste.wordpress.com/2021/03/27/product-spotlight-hairy-jayne-floral-shampoo-bar/)"
artemiscrossing,ly7fof,Do you use a leave in conditioner? That would help with shine and softness. Idk if you use gel or mousse but in my experience gel allows shine and mousse makes my hair more dull/matte looking. Also how often do you use ACV? Because if you’re using it every time you wash your hair that could be damaging it more than helping it. Maybe try a deep conditioner once a week as well? If you don’t want to buy one you can just leave your normal conditioner in your hair in the shower for like 10 mins before rinsing
gardenvarietymagpie,ly7fof,"Always hard to know what will work for others, but I was having similar issues with similar looking hair, and it turns out my hair absolutely hates anything coconut derived. I’ve finally managed to find a shampoo bar and CGM approved conditioner that are coconut free and that has helped a lot."
weirdlyfamiliarface,ly7fof,"Hi! I struggle really badly with my hair, it's brittle and unmanageable. I use a shampoo bar, store bought conditioner/ conditioner from a bulk shop and rinse with very diluted ACV. What can I do to make it smooth and shiny?&&&&&&I never thought of that, I’ll look into it, thank you!"
TraumaMamaZ,ly5rej,"Try dropping the olaplex. It looks like you have similar fine strands but thick hair to mine. Olaplex #3 did something nasty to my hair causing dry, brittle and wiry strands. A clarifying wash and a couple months later and it’s coming back around, although I have a halo of baby hairs from the olaplex causing severe breakage."
artemiscrossing,ly5rej,"If your hair is very dry, frizzy, and damaged, I would recommend using a deep conditioner about once a week. Damaged hair also can benefit a lot from protein treatments!"
mini_khaleesi,ly5rej,"Routine Help - wavy and frizzy and new&&&&&&This is my hair just out of the shower and air dried with leave in conditioner! It’s very frizzy, from being coloured, and not fully forming in most parts but trying really hard. 

Right now I’m just using:
- Pureology Lite Hydration shampoo and conditioner
- Unite 7 Second Leave in conditioner 
- Olaplex hair oil 
- Every week or so I use Olaplex mask to repair 

I tried the Kevin Murphy Killer Curls but it was too heavy despite axing the frizz, my waves were non existent. 

I prefer to air dry mostly because I colour and use a hot tool to style often, I’m trying to minimize heat. 

I also prefer salon grade products and don’t mind the cost. I prefer soft hair that doesn’t feel sticky!

Ty :)&&&Definitely agree!"
HryUpImPressingPlay,ly1puc,Great hair!
Useful-Pomelo,ly1puc,"Does the little flip at the end qualify my hair as wavy?&&&This is 4-5 months of growing it out during quarantine.  It's getting to the point where I need to decide whether to go back to my usual short side-part or keep it growing.

I just towel dry, put some Moroccan Oil texture clay in damp hair, blow dry it to 80%, then put more texture clay in the front to keep it pulled over with my fingers.

What should I be doing?  All the routines and various secrets seem to be used on shoulder length hair. Will this do anything for poofy 3-inch hair?"
hotnutonfire,ly1puc,"Ooooo yeah you should definitely do a little routine on that, see what happens before you cut. I could see it easily being beautiful tousled waves. Do you brush/comb it straight while it’s wet??"
yellow_tshirt,ly1puc,Of course you have wavy hair!! It's the best of both worlds.
ElleDeeNS,ly1cm3,"Zotos All About Curls line, which is at Sally’s. I have fine 2b hair and the low-lather cleanser and daily conditioner are my go-tos. I have never felt like my hair is weighed down with either product. I have also tried the no-lather shampoo that is in the sample pack (bought it for travel), but still repurchased the low-lather one multiple times. The no-lather is creamier. If you find you need a little bit more moisture, the travel-sized sample pack is worth picking up. I think it was $13 and gives you small bottles of the no-lather, daily conditioner, curl cream, and gel. 

If you are interested in any styler, the curl cream is also amazing (use it as my only styler on lazy days) and the gel is fantastic."
freudian_slip32,ly1cm3,"Shampoo/Conditioner in Canada?&&&Hello! I have 2B/2C hair, thin and fine, and is easily weighted down with product. What suggestions do you have for shampoo and conditioner that are available in Canada?"
Ladonnacinica,ly088e,What’s the LUS brand? Is it good for low porosity hair? Is it expensive?
NotSoAdorablyAwkward,ly088e,I used LUS for almost 2 years and loved it. Only changed because ran out during last year's early lockdown/quarantine and bought something as a holdover that I ended up loving too.
ceebee6,ly088e,"I tried it! It was a bit too heavy for my very fine, thin, low porosity hair - even emulsified. My friend loves it for her wavy hair though and uses it all the time."
idkifik,ly088e,"I didn’t like it at all. The conditiner felt very thin and made my wavy hair dry.

Like the future version of a bowl cut.

I don't want to get anything cut because I'm trying to grow it all out. I've tried doing a split look but it shows too much of my forehead.

Edit: To clarify, my bangs are straight down but at the tips instead of bending along my forehead, it hooks outwards and curls to the right, so it looks like an upside down tsunami basically.&&&Honestly never used hair clips before. It's my first time trying to grow my hair out to my shoulders.&&&I'm trying to get my hair to have a curve right before it touches my eyes.

Do I have to cut my bangs to actually style it?&&&I do. Doesn't work."
Mama-anom-nom,lxz9s1,"Have you tried variations of hair clips or head bands? Perhaps a properly placed decorative clip for example could draw attention away from the line...or even curve the line a bit if your hair is long enough. 

Another option is hair extensions, until you outgrow the awkward stage."
hotnutonfire,lxz9s1,I would do a dramatic swoop to one side and a decorative pin to hold them there
neverseektotell,lxz9s1,Just blow dry them with a round brush
theromanticpink,lxz9s1,"I'm confused because you're trying to grow them about but also if you don't have bangs there's too much forehead? 

I saw a video on how to fake things like curtain bangs using clips so it sort of covers your forehead but not completely. Or using a non heat roller to make them roll inwards or make curly bangs because then they'll be a little shorter."

3) Lastly, NYM Curl Talk gel or Jessie’s Curl gel, depending on what’s nearby tbh. I glaze this and scrunch. I find I need the gel cast for my waves to stay
4) Wait until you can’t anymore more to SOTC. The longer I keep my cast, the more defined my waves and the longer they last.

Good luck!"
iidandelion,lxp518,"“Asian Hair” | ‘Stereotypical’ asian hair (East Asian Chinese Ethnicity) | Looking at new ways of “finding the hidden curl” in what I thought used to be pin straight hair! | (Cross post from r/curlyhair )&&&I’ve been reading some new articles about fellow East asians finding a “hidden curl/wave” in their hair when following the ‘curly girl routine’ trend. I always thought my hair would be considered 1A-1B type hair (yes i’m aware this doesn’t matter much, but it’s easier to describe it like this without photos lol). 

I’m wondering what the best products and methods would be to test if i have any natural texture in my hair. I see a lot of people just go full force with the curly girl routines that many people who already know they have curl/texture use, but I know for a fact that my hair won’t do well with the types of products they are using (i know i have low porosity hair for a fact, and these other people definitely don’t based on the heavy products, oil rich, co-poo methods, etc). 

I have read some blogs/watched videos and some of the information was helpful in giving me an idea for what products would work well, but I’m looking for some extra personal tips! I also definitely know the general gist of all the steps to properly clean my hair, prep it (plopping/scrunching it included), and diffusing/drying it. I will continue to do some more research before buying anything, but I want to know if anyone has similar hair to mine and would be willing to share their experience :)

Routine: 
-I have long hair (mid back); ranging from 20-24 inches root-tip, no layers just natural growth from a blunt cut :)
-Shampoo and conditioner, I alternate between about 4 different drugstore brands simply because of the scents (lol). I’ve never given much thought to my hair products/ingredients because I always thought my hair was pin straight so styling didn’t matter (i’m sorry, ik that’s so ignorant/annoying 😭)
-i never use heat on my hair, whether it be heat styling or hair dryers....but i will likely start using a hairdryer and diffuser attachment because of the diffusing techniques in the wavy/curly hair methods :)))

TL;DR Please send feedback for methods and lightweight products that work well with low porosity hair; finding wave/texture for the first time in hair originally assumed to be pin straight!&&&thank you! what were your results??"
jng004,lxp518,"My best friend is Hong Kongese and her hair is so long she can sit on it. She never gets her hair cut because she trims it at home, and a couple of weeks ago she got bored and decided to cut some layers into her hair,and ever since then she's discovered that the ends of her hair have a pretty wave to them. I'm sure the wave would come out more if the weight of her hair didn't pull it straight, so at your length you might see more wave on your hair. I'm afraid I can't help you with product or styling recommendations, but if you're willing to get some layers cut in your hair to remove some of the weight and give it some more texture (you can keep the length if you want to!) I think that will help you discover your inner wavy girl!"
ruthmaariia,lxp518,"Hi! 
I had the same problem (and am too broke to play around with products) 
so I did what wavyhaircare suggested to test whether I have wavy hair.
Maybe it‘ll help you too :)

gatornem,lxp463,"Happy waves&&&&&&My low porosity (virgin), low density, super fine, loose waves are singing and dancing that they’re so happy today!! 💃💃

She seems to like mousse better bc she’s so easily weighed down. 




-Wash with NYM curl talk shampoo

-Detangle and STC with NYM 3-in-1 conditioner, with a little bit of prose custom conditioner mixed in

-Rinse thoroughly

-Dry in loose turban with perfect haircare towel for a few

-usually damp style and add water as needed

-Small amount of prose custom leave-in conditioner spray, rake, brush with wet brush

-NYM curl talk mousse, rake throughout, including roots

-A tad more mouse to scrunch

Then scrunch until I’m sick of it, moving head in all directions so it doesn’t stick to scalp

-Micro plop (scrunch) with perfect haircare towel

-diffuse until I’m sick of it or mostly dry (usually hover, then pixie) again, moving head in all directions

-leave cast for a while, this is vital for hold so my waves don’t fall out

-SOTC"
