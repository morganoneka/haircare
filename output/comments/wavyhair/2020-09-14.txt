MRS_PL0W,iwofiw,I sleep on a satin pillowcase and it is wonderful.  I leave my hair completely loose when I sleep. I also make sure my hair is dry and any crunch is scrunched out as well.
Veronica-Summers,iwofiw,A silk scrunchie is a good option!
angelsinner999,iwofiw,a loose braid helps me keep my hair in place overnight and creates some nice waves on my already wavy hair!!
glow89,iwofiw,"Buns causing breakage, I need suggestions for what else I can do with my hair overnight&&&I thought I finally found the perfect strategy for maintaining my waves overnight and having a good hair day the next day- slightly wetting my hair, putting in some leave in conditioner, and putting it in a bun. But I just went to get a trim and my stylist told me I need to take a break from buns because they’re causing breakage in my hair. I’ve been going to the same stylist for a long time and she’s noticed my hair breaks easily, and said I really shouldn’t put my hair in a bun frequently anymore. Unfortunately that means I’m back to square one and I have no idea what the hell I can do with my hair overnight without ruining the waves. I was finally having good hair days almost every day and now I’m stressed that I can’t do a bun every night!&&&I’ll have to try that!&&&That’s a good idea, I’ve just been using regular cotton scrunchies!&&&I didn’t realize wetting it makes it more susceptible to breakage, thank you! I always put it in a bun after washing it because it takes so long to dry it’s just annoying to have wet hair in my face and on my neck for so long.  I’ll have to look into spin pins or learn how to braid, I’m embarrassed  to admit I can’t braid my own hair lol!&&&Your hair is so pretty! I have a satin pillowcase too but sadly my hair just becomes a crazy mess if I sleep with it loose, even if it’s dry."
tabbycat,iwofiw,"Wetting the hair, even slightly, may make it more susceptible to breakage. Water causes the follicles to swell which can make the hair more fragile until it dries. You could try skipping the water and make sure to use a satin scrunchie or a coily hair tie (invisibobble or similar) that may also help. 

As for other hair styles— you could try satin scarfs or bonnets for sleeping. Scarfs can also be used in updos during the way. Braids are also a good way to keep hair out of the way and safe. You may also be able to get your bun up using something like spin pins, they are spiral Bobby pins. I can sometimes get a bun with JUST those but only if my hair is super wavy that day. 

Good luck!"
volligtoll,iwofiw,What about a silk head wrap or cap.
EquivalentFlounder2,iwecst,I use and love 'aussie work that curl serum'. It has jojoba seed oil. Its easy to warm up by rubbing in your hands and it's light.
eclo99,iwecst,Recommendations for a SOTC/frizz reducing hair oil?&&&Wondering what hair oils (or other products) you all like for SOTC and reducing frizz? I have pretty thin hair so I'm looking for something light!
SnooOranges9863,iwbl59,"yeah probably too much gel, try less and on wet hair instead of damp if thats what youre doing. another reason could be that youre using too heavy products (eg containing a lot of oils/butters)"
notesofastranger,iwbl59,"Problems with stringiness and clumping (long term issue!)&&&&&&When it dried in the gel cast it already looks stringy and broken apart. I think I'm narrowing it down to applying too much gel and possibly needed a denman styling brush  to get that 'brushed out look' when it's dried. However, this is a consistent issue I've been having, any tips and tricks from my fellow wavies?"
tabbycat,iwbl59,"My hair does this when I use butters and creams. I just switched to mousse, custard, gel (yes all three!) and I’ve notified an improvement! Also if you are raking product through, close your hand at the end of the hair to regroup the hair into bigger clumps. I recommend praying hands, roping, and glazing too (as product application techniques)"
InternationalLock474,iw9joy,"Try adding gel or mousse while your hair is damp and when it's dry you can scrunch out the crunch. Check in YouTube on how to add a gel cast to your hair. I actually add gel when my hair is wet, right after the shower. You're gonna have to see what works for you."
Rachyleww,iw9joy,"First wavy wash help!&&&Hello! I’ve jumped on the bandwagon to embrace my wavy hair, it seems my hair is 2b. 
I’ve done the first wash scrunch and plop, woken up and my hair looks- interesting. Any tips on helping with the ugly/frizzy looking stage? I know it’s a process but surely there is a way to style them once they’re dry? I’m tempted to wash out and straighten which isn’t great, 

Thank you!"
EquivalentFlounder2,iw8u0i,Don't know if it's to late but I'd say layers. I think it helps personally.
lavenderlattedrinker,iw8u0i,"Hi! What kind of haircut should I be getting? I have no choice but to go to a non curly hair salon, so specific keywords would definitely help describe a sustainable cut for my hair type. I basically want a chin length bob but like how should describe the layers? Thanks!&&&&&&Thanks for the recommendation! Will check her out😀&&&Thanks for taking the time to respond 🙂"
tabbycat,iw8u0i,"Check out Manes by Mell on YouTube, the video titled ‘Wavy Haircut Transformation’, she goes over what to ask for and what to watch out for. The hair she cuts is long but I just got a shoulder length cut using some of her terminology at a non curly salon. I asked for layers, then we talked about hidden and visible layers (she did both because my hair is super dense). It’s sort of a “modern shag” or “long layers” cut."
PriorAgreeable,iw7uy5,"First time with not-short hair; need help&&&&&&I have no idea what I’m doing, only have had short hair. Just shampoo and conditioner conditioner very now and then. What are some good resources or products you might recommend?"
tabbycat,iw7uy5,"Manes By Mell on YouTube, super good information (and it applies for wavy as well as curly hair).I think she just put together a wavy hair playlist and she has one on where to start too. Have fun experimenting and trying things!"
hulkkorgab,iw7mgn,"I had to take a double take to make sure I didn’t post a photo by accident 😂😂😂 I swear this could be my hair. Texture and color are exact. I also have straight hair like in second photo from washing off too much natural oils etcetcetcetc, but even with zero product if I light scrunch while it’s drying it looks just like your front pic, and will have slightly wavier pieces on my hair line/ by my ears. 


I want to bother because when things are more balanced (natural oils, protein, moisture blabla)  I have waves starting from scalp too but that’s only been twice that I’ve seen a hint of them. Otherwise it looks like this 98% of my tries ( I wash 2x a week I’ve been trying for a month to see what works/doesn’t)

If you do continue I do suggest finding some balance based on your hair and light scrunching when damp ( too wet will just make them fall. I’ve noticed that quickly in my trying) 

I haven’t tried products yet because I’m unsure of what will work and what won’t since my hair weighs down easy. I’m also aware products with humectants aren’t meant for humid and dry seasonal weather areas so im just trying to see what it wants to do by itself first. 

I don’t know if that helped lol I’m just on the same boat lol."
sarahevebee,iw7mgn,"Should I bother?&&&&&&Ha. I also have slightly wavier hair by my hairline/ears.
Well. I’ll keep bothering, too. 
Do you have layers in your hair?
I’m leaning towards cutting layers, because I’m curious to see what’ll happen, and hair grows back, so why not 🤷‍♀️
I do cut my own hair, however... And that last professional cut was the result of fixing an accidental mullet I gave myself...😁&&&Routine:
Wash with Giovani Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner (STC,) then Cantu Curl Activator scrunched/squished in when wet.
**I haven’t used gel or mousse yet**

I was hoping to see the natural curl (no products) that I saw after my last professional haircut (1st pic) if I treated my hair better, but I think I actually need to cut layers in it again in order to reveal my waves.
But should I bother?
Worst case scenario: I’ll have an ugly, choppy straight hair cut. 
Best case scenario: My waves will pop and it’ll be easy to style them.

I’ll try gel and/or mousse next before cutting...but I need a cut anyway, so I will cut it soon...

What do y’all think? Should I trim it (same cut)? Or layer?"
AhabsPegleg,iw16ln,"If you’re in the US, check your hippie food co-ops! Mine sells bulk Giovanni shampoo and conditioner. You bring your own container to refill it.

I know this isn’t true for all curly and wavy haired people, but most of us wash our hair less often, so that’s a way to prevent product waste too."
BigHawk3,iw16ln,Do you have recs for wavy hair bars??? I’m in a desperate search
Bike_Pretty,iw16ln,"That’s a great idea! It’s such a bummer that as individual consumers we are responsible for ensuring our plastic waste is disposed of correctly. I’ve heard of people protesting wasteful packaging by mailing the unrecyclable bottles back to the companies to deal with. Ideally, they would use better materials!"
From_the_Matriarchy,iw16ln,"This is why I don't use microfibre towels. They release a ton of micro plastic particles in the wash water. There they soak up toxins like a sponge, and end up in our food - even in plants."
JimmyWhatAreYouDoing,iw16ln,Government recycling doesn't actually recycle it just sends it out of country because it's cheaper
Pupperochini,iw16ln,"The vast majority of the recyclable plastics that make it to recycling centers are never recycled. Plastic degrades in quality and is expensive to recycle. Even if your plastic waste makes it to a recycling center it will most likely be burned or buried. Quick read: [Recycling doesn't work ](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/09/20/how-to-recycle-plastic)
longer read:  https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled)

The only way to avoid plastic waste is to simply not buy it. Glass and aluminum can be recycled efficiently while retaining quality. Cardboard and paper packaged items are also less wasteful. 

I've been using shampoo and conditioner bars, and have used bar soaps for years. I use Plaine Products lotion, aluminum bottle with a closed loop refill process. They also have liquid shampoo and conditioners. Still figuring out less wasteful stylers. I tried Simply Curls, they have aluminum bottles and you can order refills, but I don't love their formulas. Overall, reducing the amount you buy is helpful when finding sustainable products.

r/zerowaste is helpful if you're looking to reduce waste overall"
RacecarGibson,iw16ln,"I am actually seeking out no- and/or low-waste options as I research a wavy hair routine. Years ago, when I had long hair (bobbed now) I used scads and scads of V05 to co-wash my thick normal skews-to-porous 2a/2b hair. Now, knowing what I know about the shadiness of municipal recycling? I'd love to know all the bar/refill options for products that nurture waves."
a_diddle,iw16ln,"Anyone else feel bad about all the plastic bottles they use doing CGM?&&&Today I was feeling guilty about all the plastic bottles and non-recyclable personal products I used. I did some internet searching and found out about terracycle.com. It’s a free website that offers recycling solutions for businesses and homes for things that may not normally be accepted by your local recycling. All you have to do is make a free account and bring your recyclables to the post office now and then. Sure it’s one more chore to do, but I figure I can spare 10 minutes once a month to go to my post office if it’s means I’m putting less trash in landfills :) 

*this is not an endorsed post* I simply just want others to know that this resource is out there"
bezododo,iw16ln,I use Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar as shampoo and that at least comes in a glass bottle 🤷🏼‍♀️But following this because I would like to know if there are gels that use less plastic!
chelliex2,iw16ln,"I switched to 100 Senses Beauty Bar (this is NOT soap!). I use it for washing and shaving and the ONLY shampoo I use. It's gentle and perfectly PH balanced. And cleans without doing terrible things or stripping. But my hair ACTUALLY gets cleaned. It's weird. My hair loves it. While I still have plastics for conditioner, gels, mousse, whatever etc... I feel a little better since this ONE bar does the work of THREE products. Its a bit spendy, I do the subscription, but it lasts a LONG time and it does count for THREE products. So... in the end in saves me money."
dilf314,iw16ln,it also doesn’t help much since 71% of global emissions are from only 100 companies
flitandflutter,iw16ln,YESSS following this post!!
kumiki972,iw16ln,"I have also been thinking about this, I tried a shampoo bar (the saponified oil kind since I didn’t want one with sulfates) but it didn’t work for me. It made my hair waxy unless I used an ACV rinse, which I didn’t want to do every time because of the smell. Would love to hear other people’s successes with using less products packaged in plastic."
kuruttu,iw16ln,"Big issue, I buy shampoo bars and make homemade flax seed gel( hold is less,  but a sacrifice that I am bearing). for conditioner I still use plastic bottles as we don’t have good conditioner bars where i live.

lilyalo,iw16ln,"With my hair flipped over in the shower, I take the bar and just rub it down the length of my soaked hair (think rosin on a violin bow but only one direction), then squish. Sometimes if I need to get it at the roots, I sort of separate the wet hair on my head with an edge of the bar, again running it down in a few places then go in with my fingers to massage it in.  By massage, I mean running finger tips along the scalp in the same down direction until I can feel it has reached most areas of my scalp.&&&Hibar solid shampoo and conditioner volumize version is for sure cg approved - I checked the ingredients on a couple of those cg approved product/ingredient lookup sites.  Hibar makes 3 different sham/cond formulations:  a Moisturize set, a Maintain set and a Volumize set.  You'd have to check the ingredients on the Maintain and Moisturize sets if you go for those but I did in fact see a couple in the approved lists."
litttlest_lemon,iw16ln,"Yeah, this is a very big concern to me. I’m still on a search for good shampoo and conditioner bars at least. I used to use ones from Lush before learning they had ingredients that weren’t awesome, unfortunately. I did recently find a new shampoo bar at Trader Joe’s and may try that soon if they ingredients check out ok!"
lizziefulf,iw16ln,"Totally. Tried bar soaps over quarantine with little success. Still kind of bummed but just try to find things in bigger bottles so they last longer, use everything I have. 

There is something called the Loop Store where you can order refillable options from main retailers. They just don’t have a ton of CGM friendly options as of now."
m4dswine,iw16ln,"Where we live a lot of things are accepted for recycling so most stuff just goes there, but also the city uses some plastic waste to provide heating, hot water and electricity for the city. I'm on the City heating system so figure any plastic that goes in comes back in hot water, and the plants use carbon capture to clean emissions and keep the loop going."
ma_hell_yeah,iw16ln,I like Three Sisters Apothecary Curly and Wavy hair shampoo and conditioner bars. They are CGM safe I believe and have some protein in them that my wavy hair likes.
miauumilk,iw16ln,"You used soap? There are shampoo bars without sulphates in it. Even lush has one.&&&YES! This is the reason why I came up with my own version of it. I only use products that I can buy packaging free or in plastic free packaging.

My routine:

- washing the hair with **rye flour and/or clay** (ghassoul most of the time, but I also like kaolin) I buy both in a paper bag.
- I use a **conditioner bar** to detangle ect. (I have not found the perfect one yet. I used to use jungle from lush, but its not available anymore. I think the ones with only oils as ingredients dont work very good for my hair.)
- Sometimes I additionally use an **oil**.
- I detangle with a **wooden wide tooth comb**, and sometimes add more conditioner while doing it. after the detangeling, I seperate some curly out and scrunch a bit.
- I wash everything out and put my hair upside downd in a towel to take away excess water. 
- I use **flaxseed gel** to scrunch. It can have diffrent curl holding strengh. I make it myself, and the more seeds I use and the longer I let it boil, the stronger it is. 


Since I am to lazy to make flaxseed gel everytime, I make a huge batch and fill it up in my muffing form. I freeze it (its a perfect portion size) and take it out after it is frozen to store it in a diffrent container (in the freezer). 

I have to take it out a few hours to melt everytime I wash my hair, but its not that big of a deal, since I exactly know when I want to wash my  hair."
notesofastranger,iw16ln,Do you find that using bars really tangles your hair? I used to lather them between my hands and then apply but i find they tend to lack slip. How do people find is the best way yo apply?
opalandolive,iw16ln,"I'm using bar soaps, shampoo and conditioner now to cut down on plastic."
rmcburg,iw16ln,I really love flour sack towels! Far superior to microfiber. I use em for paper towels too.
seraphflight,iw16ln,"I’m using bars as well! I use the tea tree and lavender shampoo and conditioner bars that are intended for wavy hair from Three Sisters Apothecary by Soap Cauldron based in Sonoma County, California. They smell great, have a lather and rinse easily, and the conditioner isn’t too heavy for my hair. I still occasionally have to clarify but it cuts my plastic bottle use down to just my styler and a spare bottle of V05 I rarely touch."

nikki5210,iw0mxo,"Is Dippity Do Girls with Curls gel good for waves?&&&I know this gel is extremely popular in the curly hair community. Through out my hair journey I've definitely learned not all products which curlies love will work for my wavy hair. What are you experiences with this gel?

My hair is usually flat to my head too. And I struggle with volume. I hope it helps!"
coastalsagebrush,ivv3ma,I love it! How do you get all the volume at the top of your head? My hair has a similar/slightly curlier pattern than yours but it's always so flat at the top and I just can't ever get any volume up there even when I diffuse it lol

Your experience/opinion: I live in a notoriously hard water area - all of our drinking glasses get a milky white residue, all windows and cars have water spots. It's gross.  I read that a chelating shampoo will be better (must contain EDTA to be considered Chelating), and I chose this one after a lot of reading. The results are great. Bonus : it's swimmers shampoo, good for removing chlorine. 


Great for:
-	clarifying wash 
-	swimmers 
-	removing mineral deposits from hard water 
-	achieving shine 

Not great for :
-	color treated hair. (That's what the Amazon description says. I used this with semi - permanent color in and it didn't strip it out.)

Your experience/opinion: This is the series I've used most from this brand (and generally really). It has protein which my hair loves, but not quite enough for me, and I find it a bit too drying. My hair is at the curlier end of the spectrum though, so I'm recommending it so maybe someone who needs less moisture than I do can have a go because it foams really well and generally feels nice to use.

&#x200B;

I've also tried the By Veira Sensitive Shampoo, which is protein free, but I can't recommend it as I don't have the ingredient list (and it's not available online). For me it was almost identical in results to the ""Repair"" shampoo, so could work if you want that but without protein.  Wouldn't recommend it to people with extremely sensitive though, skin as it (ironically enough) made me itch a bit."

**Other information:** It's not cheap, unfortunately; but since it's not used often, it should last quite a while. 

**Your experience/opinion:** I have read that wavies - especially who have hard water - can benefit from a chelating shampoo for clarifying, and this was recommended. I had previously been using Suave Essentials Clarifying Shampoo and it just wasn't doing the trick. (I also was dealing with a moisture overload and NOTHING was working. BB Sunday Shampoo and skipping leave-in conditioning made a huge difference.)

**Hair Type:** Medium to high porosity; color treated as well (which the BB isn't ideal for, but I do it every couple of weeks and it's not awful on my color). Fine (2b-c). Medium Light density."

Your experience/opinion:  It gets my hair clean without drying it out or weighing it down. It's gentle enough to not irritate my scalp. I usually wash 2-3 times a week, occasionally more.

Retiredgiverofboners,ivs46p,I have medium porosity thick hair and I’ve tried so many cgm shampoos the best results I ever had (when I first started) were suave clarifying and a nexus protein mask after.

I bought this after being underwhelmed by the Briogeo Oat and Aloe soothing shampoo, and I like it so much better and it's so much cheaper!  It does foam up and cleanse the hair, and it is indeed gentle on my irritable scalp.  It's also lightly moisturizing/non-stripping.

Info: on the pricey side. $25 in the states, but I got for $33 from Sephora in Canada. Bottle is really small!!! Only 8oz. 

My experience: so I was on a hunt for fragrance free products because I’ve been noticing itching and build up on my scalp, as well as the skin that my hair touches. I was also noticing body acne so fragrance free was a must bc not having my hair touch my skin was getting extremely hard. I also needed a product with protein bc my hair is going through some moisture overload right now. Only need a little bit of the product as it lathers really well, so far I really like it but curious to see how long it lasts bc it is pricey.

WeAreStarless,ivs46p,"Survey results & request for shampoo recommendations!&&&Hello again!

First of all, thank you so much for all your input on [what about the curly girl method does not work for wavies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wavyhair/comments/irc62r/what_about_the_curly_girl_method_does_not_work/). I read all the comments (I'm sorry for not replying to them, but it would have been an endless stream of ""noted, thank you!""), and did my best to tally all the points that everyone brought up.

# Survey results

Here they are! These are the things that most people agreed on:

* Cowashing doesn't work, and low-poos are on thin ice too. Clarifying often is required, or even just using a sulfate shampoo for every single wash
* Heavy products (so those that contain a lot of butters and/or oils) are a no-go. Some may be able to make it work if they only use a teeny tiny amount
* Less is more. Layering multiple leave-in / styling products on top of each other makes things worse, not better
* Mousse is a much-loved product! This makes sense, because it's probably the most lightweight of the styling options
* When it comes to the protein/moisture balance, it's very easy to go overboard on the moisture. A lot of protein is necessary to prevent that
* The mantra of ""don't brush curly hair"" doesn't hold up for wavies. Many of you like the look of brushed-out waves
* The already-incorrect idea that you should only wash your hair once or twice a week is proving particularly incorrect for wavies as well. Regular washdays are key

And these are the things that you were much more divided on:

* Wet styling vs damp styling. Some of you prefer to apply leave-in products on soaking wet hair, while others prefer to remove the water first through scrunching, (micro)plopping, etc
* Speaking of plopping: not quite a 50/50 split (there were more people for whom plopping didn't work than for whom it did), so people will have to try it out themselves to see if it works for them
* The opinions about gel were all over the place. This wasn't a clear case of ""in favour"" or ""against"", but rather most people only being able to make it work when used in a very specific way
* Whether to detangle in the shower when your hair is soaking with water and conditioner, or beforehand on dry hair. Different things work for different people

Some things were hardly mentioned, such as silicones, leading me to believe that most of you do agree with going silicone-free. A few different styling techniques were mentioned (such as scrunching, raking, prayer hands, roping, finger coiling, upside down styling and using a Denman brush), but not often enough that I was able to conclude whether any were superior to others for wavies. All of this information will eventually be used in what I hope will be our wiki, so thank you all so much!

# Cleanser recommendations

Now onto the actual main event of this post: cleanser recommendations! All varieties (sulfate shampoo, low-poo, cowash, apple cider vinegar rinse, anything else you can think of) are acceptable. You can recommend multiple products, but for each product, I would like you to copy and paste this little list and fill it in.

>Brand:

>Name:  
>  
>Ingredient list:  
>  
>Other information:  
>  
>Your experience/opinion:

If you are from a country that is not the USA and the product is only available where you live, please mention which country and recommend it anyway! We are sorely lacking non-American resources.

And then this is optional, because I don't even know what I'm going to do with this information in regards to the products, but I figure I might as well ask and see if I see any kind of trend.

>Your porosity (low to high):  
>  
>Your strand thickness (fine to coarse):  
>  
>Your density (thin to dense):

Next week, I'll rotate onto conditioners. In the end, I'm hoping to compile a big list of product recommendations. While it's still true that everyone's hair is different, and everyone's hair will react differently to products, I'm hoping that this list will be at least a little more suited for wavies!

As always, if you have other / better ideas about how to do this, please let me know! I'm just making all of this up as I go along. Thank you all so much for your feedback and your kind words ❤️&&&TRESemmé makes a sulfate free shampoo? I had no idea! That's awesome&&&Do you have the ingredient lists of these shampoos?"

Other information: 

Your experience/opinion: 
I love this as a co-wash. Having protein makes a noticeable difference! In some ways, my co-wash hair is better than wash day hair because it has more bounce as well as a few loose coils, though my scalp never feels as clean as when I use shampoo. 

I have malassezia (fungal acne) and while it's under control, I'm quick to get little breakouts around my temples if the hair product I'm using has too many oils or irritating ingredients. This co-wash has never given me problems, though I do make sure to rinse it all out.

**Other info:** CG friendly in a sense that it's sulfate free I guess


**My opinion/experience:** quite thick when you pump it out and doesn't lather as much compared to other sulfate free shampoos (probably due to the thicker texture). Spreading this on my hands then applying on the scalp/hair is the easiest way to get decent lather. Contains quite a fair bit of surfactants but they seem quite gentle. On extra lazy days, I have even used this on my face as a cleanser and nothing terrible has ever happened! Would be imo a good shampoo to use if you like to wash your hair often. It smells like breakfast food, like warm oatmeal.

Experience/opinion: Going against the grain here, but my hair loves Co-washing. It could be because I am right on the edge between wavy and curly - ive got everything from 2b-3a on my head. This is by far the best co-wash ive tried. It leaves my hair clean without being squeaky, it lathers up a tiny, tiny bit but you do have to work your hands to get the maximum amount of cleansing out of it. It also smells divine. The downsides of it have nothing to do with the product itself - I have to use quite a lot of it because ive got very dense hair and it is somewhat pricey, but that might mainly be because I live in Europe (Germany.)

Whereas 1s were straight for a while down the hair before waving at the ends?&&&Lol you good! I'm still trying to figure it out. Bit I'm p sure I'm somewhere around 1c/2a. I got 2a and 2b confused.&&&Hmmmm this is crazy frizzy. Idk if it's noticeable. I have the most intense frizz rn. This is after combing it and then humidity taking over.&&&I guess also, worth mentioning is my hair has no curl memory from being straight for the past 30 years&&&To answer the auto mod.....

This routine is silly.

This is day 3. I wanted to try curl dreams (youtube) one product refresh. I went and got the Pantene Curl Mousse, wetted my hair with a spray bottle and applied it. 

It went not great. Once I had let the crunch form and diffused a little bit (have to use heat) and took some time to just hand scrunch it out.... Well, it just looked bad. 

So I wide-tooth combed it out. And THIS was the result. I actually really like it. 

It's not much of a routine to share. Sorry!"
VintageWitchcraft,ivmhcs,"I agree, its nice to comb out the crunch sometimes. What I like to do to prevent frizz is to use a spray bottle and give my hair a very light mist and with the softest touch I smooth everything over and give it one last upward scrunch."
binchplz,ivmhcs,"It just doesn't look like 2B to me (I have 2Bish hair, and the frizz ain't no joke in Texas). Imo, there's no point in worrying about which type you have too much. It's just doing what makes you happiest with your hair

Edit: Oops, I meant to reply instead of make another seperate comment&&&2B is a more prominent S-shape, and can get really frizzy. If this is after combing it out, I think you're more in the range of 1B-1C."
hulkkorgab,ivmhcs,"That’s closer to 1B/C

Check out the 2As, there are a few recents"
