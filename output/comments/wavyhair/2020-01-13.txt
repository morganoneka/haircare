BringOnTheShibas,er6th0,This is my hair goal!!! Your hair is gorgeous!!
danaarends,er6th0,"My natural waves 🖤&&&&&&Every third day-
Shampoo: beauty & planet murumuru butter & rose
Conditioner: beauty & planet murumuru butter & rose 

Detangle with my Wet brush with the conditioner in my hair (I use a lot).

Let conditioner sit for 3-5 minutes, flip hair over & squish to condish. Apply product straight from shower...
Products: Mop Top curly hair custard, LA Looks gel #9 (yellow one).

I use praying hands to apply then scrunch a lot. Then grab a cotton T-shirt to scrunch our excess water and product. Then I go straight to diffusing. I have the black orchid diffuser. When it’s about 90% dry, I let it finish air drying then scrunch out the crunch when it’s completely dry.

To refresh, I wet my hair a little bit and use Herbal Essence Totally Twisted mousse. I don’t use very much. Then diffuse.

I do a hair mask once a week as well. I use the garnier avocado 1 minute hair mask. It sits on my hair for 30 minutes. Then I squish to condish and use the same products as wash day above. 

Hope this helps!"
greengirl30,er6th0,Gorgeous hair! Also this looks like your album cover lol
judereddithere,er6th0,Routine please!
NoEggxaggeration,eqsnx7,Is the thickening spray by Renpure?
leafonthewind728,eqsnx7,"My waves wanted protein :)&&&&&&After using a lot of deep conditioning treatments i still felt my hair needed something, so I ordered a protein/collagen spray. Love the results so far!

My products: LUS shampoo/conditioner 
**important, final rinse under ice cold water, usually in sink*

With soaking wet hair:
Scrunch with LUS all in one for wavy hair
Spray all over with *renpure biotin & collagen thickening spray while still wet 
Scrunch design essentials almond and avocado mousse

Twist up into microfiber towel and let it dry until I get annoyed with it or too cold from wet hair

Clip roots into 3 sections (top and sides) and let air dry! Photo is during root clipping phase

avakadava,eq7xi7,U have such beautiful shiny jet black hair
lexialu,eq7xi7,"To think I used to hate my waves and baby hair as a kid&&&&&&I really wish I was taught to love my hair, instead of being criticized for it. Every hair type is beautiful:)&&&Wow thank you so much!!! <3"
Butthole0169,epx66o,Could it possibly be wavy? This is with product and scrunched&&&&&&My hair might just possibly be messy and present the illusion of a wave but some strands of my hair are true waves and a lot is straight i don’t know if it’s worth the hard work just to end up with no result. I bought wave cream and some conditioner for cheap to see if that does anything but I think I’m just tricking my hair. If you guys have any advice send it my way. Thank you!!:)
PMme_your_dreams,epx66o,"Okay my hair is almost exactly like yours - it was straight for sure when I was younger but now definitely have like “half a wave” in some sections as I like to say. When it’s wet I definitely have wave, but it always disappears for the most part once dry. I would love to keep up with what you try and what you find works! I believe we have waves in there it’s just a matter of convincing them to come out hahaha"
forgotshoesagain,epx66o,Wavy - I’d recommend looking into CGM. Mine looked a lot like this when I started and now I actually get called “curly” at times.
lilacwine79,epx66o,"Blow dry with a diffuser or plop your hair as it dries. My hair was straight my whole life, but it’s become wavier as I age. Diffusing was a game changer for me, it definitely creates waves and even curls (which then settle down into waves). Good luck!"
freckslj,eox48v,"I just started and my hair is pretty much exactly like yours. And my hair was once really curly (but then I straightened for years which destroyed it). I’m struggling to stick with it atm and just feeling frustrated. I’d love to know if you find a better co-wash. I’ve been using tresemme as well. 
Good luck!"
fritzrits,eox48v,"It's normal for your hair to be  oily at first while your scalp gets used to not being dried out. It will keep overproducing oil then normalized if you keep it up.&&&I use co wash daily and in the 3rd or 4th day I use a low poo and that works out for me. Everyone has a different routine that works for them since everyone has different hair. Once your scalp oil normalizes, experiment to see what works for you."
isthataguninyourpant,eox48v,Keep it up. What are you using to cowash?
nikichicken,eox48v,"Just started, more in comments&&&&&&I’ve always assumed I had straight hair, until I started reading people with a bit of wave when wet decided to try CGM. 
I did my first clarifying wash Saturday, with water refreshes u til today when I’ve just cowashed, gel and scrunched... I see waves but my hair looks super oily. 
Should I bother continuing or not?&&&If anyone’s interested here it is, day after wash day, and it doesn’t look as stringy and oily but not as defined I guess. 
[Day 2](https://imgur.com/gallery/oiv6Mgr)&&&Thanks,and I agree it does look crunchy, but it doesn’t feel it... 
I’ll see how it’s looking tomorrow as well as I think reset wash looked the same, but then looked better the following day or two.&&&Thanks, I’ll update if I find one that works, but I was thinking the same as mentioned above, that I might have to low poo for a while until my hair isn’t quite as oily and heavy."
squigglylinesofine,eox48v,"I'm late to the party, but I came to say that when my hair does this, instead of using a towel to dry my hands, I use my hair instead. It seems like the added moisture helps redistribute the product and floofs it up. Basically just do your normal scrunch thing on your hair throughout the day for revival. Don't touch your hair otherwise"
theresaketo,eox48v,"Your hair doesn’t look oily to me, but it does look like the gel made it crispy. I really recommend Ecoco Gel with Argan oil to keep your wave hold and still have soft touchable hair. I kept getting bad hair days using gel until I switched to this product. A little goes a long way! Also, I ditched the wide tooth comb and switched to a denman brush in the shower. It helps clump but also really spreads product evenly. I think you have a nice wave pattern, just have to tweak your routine until you find the best one."
