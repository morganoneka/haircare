No-Collection-6982,tj2ei6,You have beautiful curls and length
_bmd365,tj2ei6,"Your hair looks pretty healthy! Are you happy with how it turns out with your current routine or what are you looking to achieve? 

In general, deep conditioner is usually a solid add to any wavy/curly hair routine, since our hair tends to be drier than straight hair (oil can‚Äôt travel an easy down the hair shaft).

As for styling products, I‚Äôd recommend applying something for moisture (a leave-in, a curl cream, or a serum) followed by something for hold (a gel, a mousse or even a foam). Then you can smooth on a little of your oil once your hair is dry to break any cast you may have and tame frizz."
sanjm95,tj2ei6,"Help determining what hair needs?&&&&&&Thank you for the input!! I was hoping to achieve a more uniform wave and less frizz. It looks messy to me, but it is nice to hear that it looks healthy to others!&&&Thank you for the kind compliment :)&&&I use head and shoulders smooth and silky daily shampoo and rotate between tresemme flawless curls conditioner and function of beauty wavy hair conditioner. I comb and brush with a wet brush after washing hair and apply argon magic hair oil and herbal essence gel to the ends and scrunch up once lightly, then let air dry. I can‚Äôt tell what my hair porosity is and what product it needs more of. Any help appreciated!&&&Thank you so much! I feel better about my hair now lol"
-DisgruntledPelican-,tj22z1,"I‚Äôm still very new to all of this, but my hair tangles so much.  I am trying to brush it out with a wet brush/comb in the shower with conditioner (normally sit down in the bath, with the shower off because it takes so freaking long), then flip it, and then do it again (mostly finger raking and combing) My hair even tangles on the flip, so even if I got all the knots/tangles out right side up, it normally tangles again.
  
If you find a good way - let me know! Though, I‚Äôm going to put in the practice of maybe not combing upside down like someone else posted.
  
I still don‚Äôt know how anyone can wear their hair down for a full day without clumps of matts forming.

MrsE2010,tj22z1,"Too much protein could definitely contribute but how are you protecting your hair at night? 

A satin/silk pillowcase or bonnet would help if you aren't using one. Hair rubbing against other materials can cause knotting and frizz."
earlyfair,tj22z1,"A few thoughts, which may or may not be helpful...

\--When was your last haircut? I have fine 2a-b hair that gets split ends easily, and the more split ends I have, the quicker it tangles. Your tangles are at the root so maybe this is not the direct cause.

\--Too much protein might be making it worse, by adding more structure to the hair.

\--I'm not convinced that upside down styling is the best option for wavies, since waves are not as tight as curls and can lose some of their shape at the root when you flip your head back right side up. I don't remember who commented this but on a post several days ago someone said that curls wrap around each other, but waves just stack like spoons, which can get dislodged when you switch from upside down to right side up. This could cause root tangling.

\--maybe try detangling on day 2 or so as well? Several ways to do this: detangle wave by wave and then reform each wave individually (credit for this to 2bornot2bwaves on insta, I believe) or detangle all at once and embrace the looser wave. You can refresh after either of these to reduce some (not all) frizz. And I would recommend using a light oil or other product to add slip to you hair before detangling!"
unsurepondering,tj22z1,"How to handle tangles?&&&Hello, the title says it all. I am about a month into my hair journey, with fine, low porosity 2b/2C waves. I wash every 3 or 4 days, depending on buildup. These last few washes I have noticed that my hair is tangling a lot at the roots on the back of my head. 

Today I spent about 20 minutes, head upside down, working to get the tangles loose before I proceeded to squish my conditioner. (I had already applied to conditioner until my hair felt like seaweed before I started detangling). I alternated between using my fingers, a wet brush, and a wide toothed comb. 

Does anyone else have an issue with tangles? How do you handle / prevent them? Is there anything I can do on days between washes to help tame them so they aren‚Äôt so bad when I am finally washing my hair? 

I really don‚Äôt refresh too much yet, as I‚Äôm trying to get my wash day routine squared away before I start learning even more. I currently use Bounce Curl products, and I do think the gel I have been using has too much protein, because I have symptoms of overload, so I am trying a new one next wash (Jelly Soft Curls).

Could protein overload be contributing to the tangles? Do you think this will resolve when I switch to a gel that doesn‚Äôt have so much protein in it? 

Thanks in advanced for your input! ‚ù§Ô∏è&&&Thank you for all of these! You made some really good points. I‚Äôve actually been wanting to get my hair trimmed, but I‚Äôve been so scared to go to a salon because they always try to brush and straighten my hair, no matter where I go üò≠

I‚Äôll look up that Instagram and see if I can find their post on the detangling method for Day 2. Thank you so much!!&&&Thank you! I am pineappling my hair but don‚Äôt have anything else yet. I actually expecting a bonnet from in the mail BlissSilk today or tomorrow."
HonestlyRespectful,tj10co,"In all reality, a lot of these posts are the same questions over and over again. It's the same in most subs like this. If people would just do a search, they would find a similar post that answers their question before they post.&&&To answer your question, V05 kiwi lime squeeze clarifying shampoo is 88 cents at Walmart and does the job of clarifying and chelating. Also, suave daily clarifying is popular. Kinky Curly Come Clean is a good clarifier/chelator, as well. In the grand scheme of things, shampoo really isn't all that important as in what kind you get. Just get something that your scalp likes. Most anything with sulfate will get rid of buildup. Just try to find something without silicones in it."

NotAPigeonInDisguise,tixy2v,"Waves throughout the day: a compilation.&&&&&&Routine:

-I was using Redkin‚Äôs length line in the blue bottle for a couple of months, along with ouai‚Äôs leave-in and finishing with moroccanoil‚Äôs moroccan oil treatment. I decided to change it up to the following:

*Pacifica‚Äôs wavy shampoo and conditioner

*Function of Beauty‚Äôs Wavy Hair Leave-In Treatment

As far as styling products, I‚Äôve tried a variety of mousses , some spray gels, regular gels, etc. but right now Sexyhair‚Äôs Texture Beach Spray and Mousse have worked the best. I usually towel dry/plop for about 5-10 mins, and then apply my styling products; I take the time to spray down my hair with distilled water each day or two (three if I‚Äôm lucky) and detangle with the Leave In Treatment, or another leave-in product. I scrunch the waves in with the spray first, while hair is pretty wet. After I have waves forming, I go in and dry my roots with a concentrator. After that, i slowly travel down to the ends trying not to disturb the wave pattern. 

Today was a refresh day, instead of a wash day :)&&&I scrunch my crunch haha, the second pic was mid-dry :)"
RingAroundtheTolley,tixy2v,Looks good.  I‚Äôm new here
lavavaga,tixy2v,"Looks great! One thing I noticed from the pictures and your description that you don‚Äôt scrunch out the crunch (google it if you don‚Äôt know it). That might be intentional but if you prefer your hair the way it looks in the last pic, than I‚Äôd suggest adding it to your routine."
Head-Philosophy1185,tiv46k,"I have no idea how to make my hair presentable&&&
My hair is long, it curls after I shower and let it air dry and then I brush it out it get s super frizzy I have a lot of hair on my head but the individual hairs are thin. 
I dont like the feeling of having a lot of product on my hair and I like to brush it every night but at the same time I have no idea how to tame it, how to style it. I just keep it in a loose pony tail or a braid or a bun..
Any tips of how to style waist length wavy frizzy hair like some daily easy style?
Any products that will keep it looking good?
Side note: I stopped styling my hair after I started wearing a headscarf due to religious reasons. And I basically forgot what I used to do. but im soon getting married and my husband will be seeing my hair for the first time and I don't want to look like a mess.

Thank you so much"
HonestlyRespectful,tiv46k,"If you don't like the feeling of products in your hair, maybe just try a leave in conditioner while your hair is damp after you shower. Then you can brush it through your hair. Then use a tshirt and gently scrunch the excess water out of your hair. Then don't touch it! Don't brush it again. Either let it air dry or use a diffuser. This will help your waves lay nicely and not frizz up. If leave in conditioner isn't enough, try a mousse. After it's completely dry you can use a serum, oil or your hands to gently scrunch out the crunchiness, and it'll be soft, but your waves will hold their shape."
22evie,tiuhxv,"Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Threat or Ouai Medium Shampoo?&&&I'm trying to create a haircare routine and can't pick between these two shampoos. I would really appreciate any insight!

I think I have 2A hair, but it usually looks straight because I don't know how to care for it. My focus at the moment is overall hair health though, I'm not bothered about defining my waves at the moment. My hair is mostly my natural color with a few highlights. The thickness is either fine or medium - I'm leaning towards medium - but definitely not thick. Speaking of, you know the 'place a single strand of hair between your finger and thumb and see if you can feel it' test - this might be a stupid question, but are you supposed to MOVE it between your fingers before you see if you can feel it, or are you just supposed to feel it without moving it at all? I'm pretty sure my hair is high density - I have LOTS of it and you can barely see my scalp. Speaking of scalp, I'm pretty sure I have dry scalp - it gets very itchy and flaky. I usually wash it once a week. I don't know if this is best, it's just something I've always done. It is very prone to getting knotted, and the knots are VERY hard to get out. Regarding the porosity, I have no clue. It gets wet very quickly and dries very slowly, that's all I know. It's also been EXTREMELY static and flyaway lately when brushing which has been driving me crazy.    


Thanks in advance!&&&This might be a stupid question - but if the TTTT line is very cleansing, could it be used as a clarifying shampoo? Or do shampoos have to have sulphates to be classed as clarifying? Thanks so much!"
pjj165,tiuhxv,"I can‚Äôt speak to the Ouia products as I‚Äôve never tried them, but I have loved everything I have ever used from Giovanni. Great quality products for a good price. The TTTT line is very lightweight, but also very cleansing. If you find it‚Äôs too strong for you, the 50:50 line is also nice. And the smooth as silk line has protein if your hair likes that."
Lica_Angel,titfa0,"I divide my hair in 4ths (middle part and ear to ear) and braid (I'd french braid the bottom and dutch braid the top if I knew how) it. Then clip the braids together on the top of my head. Then bonnet on day 1 of hair

Day 2-3 I braid it in 2 braids or one braid, bonnet.

By then I wash it. Repeat."
NeonTacos777,titfa0,"Pineapple and cover your hair with a wrap or something similar.

Honestly it doesn't work 100% all the time either.

I've been pineapple-ing my hair on top of my head and then i have one of those gaiter/ headwrap things so I have it on my neck before I put my hair up and then i pull it up over all my hair and the top, so that way it's all held in place while i sleep, if i can keep it from coming off at night.

That's the best i got."
quietwaffle,titfa0,"how the heck do you prevent frizz by sleeping on your hair?!&&&&&&Interesting! I've tried two braids and bonnet before but not 4, I'm defintely going to try this, thank you"
-ScorpionWitch-,tirdd5,"I think your hair is beautiful. Are you using any clarifying shampoos or deep conditioners? If not, you might want to work those into your routine. The trick is to find how often to use them. Everyone‚Äôs hair is different. People also use apple cider vinegar as a clarifier. I have yet to try this because I find the smell of vinegar so aversive, but I heard it works miracles."

SucytheWitch,tirdd5,"That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for debunking the myth of ""If you have frizz, that means your hair is dry and unhealthy"" because I also think that's bs. It might be true for some cases, but if you have naturally wavy hair, it will have a little bit of frizz, no matter how hydrated and moisturized it is. 
I for example have 1c/2a hair and a few shorter and finer baby hairs around the crown of my head tend to poof up a bit and stand out from the rest of my hair. My ends and lengths are quite straight and sleek though, with a little bit of wave towards the ends. It's shiny and manageable, but I can't change the fact that my shorter baby hairs will frizz up a bit."

anndrago,tirdd5,"Probably not what you want to hear, but I think your hair looks beautiful and not messy at all."
aprettypansy,tirdd5,"Your hair is actually pretty sleek for wavy hair.  You have a nice even pattern.  If you have wavy hair you are going to get some degree of frizz unless your hair has been heat styled.  All those women you see in YouTube and on TV with sleek wavy hair and no frizz, it's usually because they had a blow out done.  Frizz is when the shorter hairs on your head, which everyone has, form a curl and stick outwards.  It's not an indication that there is anything wrong with your hair.  With some people this is more evident than others because their shorter hairs have a tendency to curl a certain way."

Mikanis,tiq7ts,"Hey, we could be brothers. Ican't really speak to product,  that's all new to me too,  but I've had a lot of luck with a diffuser on a hair dryer. Mine is fine but dense,  so it's heavy. Plopping helped, but didn't give me super consistent curl patterns,  so I went to drying it with my head down. If you can keep your fingers out of it during this process, you get nice curls and less frizz. Just resist moving it around too much as you dry."
Original_Complex9050,tiq7ts,Honestly my hair does the same and I‚Äôve found that scrunching creates the most frizz for me. I think it really helps to be super gentle for scrunching or not at all and just finger coil or brush style even though it‚Äôs more time consuming sadly
aprettypansy,tiq7ts,"Some amount of frizz is inevitable if you have wavy hair.  I don't think you are going to get your hair any less frizzy than this.  Your hair looks exactly like mine  when I have tried everything.

We lose 100 hairs a day.  We naturally all have shorter hairs on our scalp.  The shorter hairs curl outwards creating frizz.  It doesn't mean they are damaged or that there is anything wrong with them.  You can use gel and spray to keep the frizz away somewhat, but you will never eliminate it if your shorter hairs curl outwards.  The people you see in the media with really smooth hair have have had it blown out and heat styled."

I just use this because it's what I currently have on hand though because I'm still new to taking care of my curls so i do not know if this is even the best for my hair.

I used to dry brush and now I wet comb and it is so much easier! So much less painful and knotted.  First I shampoo around my roots and then I use conditioner on the rest of it. I do the wet combing with a wide tooth comb with the conditioner still in it, then I rinse the conditioner out. With my hair still wet I put LA Looks extreme hold gel in and scrunch it in. Then I plop it for 15 min and after that I let it air dry.

thefirststrawhat,tiq7ts,"Same wave pattern, same issues with frizz (even after taking tips from here and living with someone who has very nice curls). If it‚Äôs been a long time since getting your hair cut you may just need a trim to relayer and get rid of split ends. You may also want to try a diffuser which has helped me (on cooperative hair days). Days that my hair has more oil seem to be less frizzy than my shampoo days, so maybe less product and more days in between washes.

In any case, you have a great head of hair there! Good luck figuring out what works. Keep notes (mental or written) and just try out a bunch of stuff until it looks how you want ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
uterusyeeterus,tiq7ts,"When you‚Äôve got conditioner in your hair, scrunch it in with your head upside down just like you‚Äôd do for gel and leave it in until right before you get out of the shower. Also when you run out of your current products, switching to shampoo and conditioner  formulated for wavy/curly hair could help! I‚Äôve been using ethique‚Äôs shampoo and conditioner bars for curly hair and love them. I also really like using flaxseed gel which is pretty cheap and easy to make. I find it doesn‚Äôt have as much of a gel cast as other gels, and my hair is way less frizzy. But I also agree that some frizz is unavoidable!"

I like to use a Tangle Teaser (or another wet brush) and brush small sections perpendicular to my scalp when my hair is wet and full of product. I have gotten much better definition doing this than any other technique. Then I micro plop and glaze a little foam or gel over it. Manes by Mell has some good examples on her YouTube channel. I highly recommend her videos. Seriously changed my hair"

I tried the green apple one but it has vegetable oil in it and I don't think my hair liked that...kind of greasy. It looks like the rice water one is middle ground for heaviness without the oils!"

22evie,tio9hz,"Trying to create a routine - please help me choose a shampoo&&&Hey everyone, I am in the process of trying to create a haircare routine but it is so overwhelming. There are so many products out there and everyone's hair is so different and some of the most frequently recommended products here can't be bought in the EU and a lot of them aren't cruelty free either. My focus at the moment is on just making my hair as healthy as it can be - I'm not going to worry about scrunching and gels etc for a while. So I am looking for the basics first, a good shampoo and conditioner and possibly a good clarifying shampoo (do you need a clarifying shampoo if you don't use products with silicones?). I have narrowed it down to 4 shampoos and I would love you guys' help with picking one to try out first! I think I have 2A hair, mostly my natural color with a few highlights, the thickness is either fine or medium but definitely not thick, high density, dry scalp, very prone to getting knotted, regarding the porosity, I have no clue. It gets wet very quickly and dries very slowly, that's all I know. It's also been EXTREMELY static and flyaway lately when brushing which has been driving me crazy. Here are the shampoos:

[Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Threat Shampoo](https://giovannicosmetics.com/product/tea-tree-triple-treat-invigorating-shampoo-salon-quality/)

[Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl and Shine Shampoo](https://www.beautybay.com/p/shea-moisture/coconut-and-hibiscus-curl-and-shine-shampoo/)

[Shea Moisture Superfruit Complex 10 in One Shampoo](https://www.beautybay.com/p/shea-moisture/superfruit-complex-10-in-1-multi-benefit-shampoo/)

[Aveda BeCurly Shampoo](https://www.aveda.co.uk/product/5311/16989/hair-care/shampoo/be-curly-shampoo)

Also - it doesn't have to be one of these shampoos, if you have a recommendation that's cruelty free and can be purchase in the EU/UK then that's great too! I'm open to using silicones - I haven't figured out whether my hair likes them yet or not.

Thanks in advance!"
HonestlyRespectful,tio9hz,Shampoo really isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things. Just something that your scalp likes.
g434,tio9hz,I‚Äôve only tried the Giovanni tea tree but I loved it! If you don‚Äôt mind the minty smell and feel of it I‚Äôd say go for this. Cheap and cleans well. Never tried shea moisture but i know it‚Äôs tends to be a bit heavier on finer or wavier hair
Bananacowww,timxnx,I hope this will be me next time I wash my hair! I just got out of the shower to find this post... I‚Äôm doing so many things wrong! I have had only one good hair day this year and I can‚Äôt recreate it... lol
GlitterBlood773,timxnx,"Your hair looks amazing!! I didn‚Äôt see the OG post- CHECKED THE OG POST- holy wow Batman! Great call getting a cut. Your definition & patterns look great.

Can I ask why you switched NYM pink to green? I tried pink because it‚Äôs on the more moisturizing  side of NYM, but it was too heavy so it‚Äôll be shave gel üòõ"
LadyNibbles,timxnx,"Hair Update! More info and previous link in comments!&&&&&&Biggest changes from my previous post 

‚ú®I cut significant length off (also had it highlighted)

‚ú®I changed my conditioner NYM Pink to NYM Green

Shampoo - Aveeno Rose Water and Chamomile blend

Conditioner - NYM Matcha Green Tea & Apple Blossom

Leave in - NYM Curl Talk defining Cream

Routine: 
Wash with shampoo right side up, rinse upsidedown. 

Apply conditioner upsidedown and scrunch into hair. 

Flip hair  and continue other with other shower tasks right side up. (My hair looked a little crazy at this step)

Flip hair upside down, finger comb.  Rinse, scrunch, shake head gently from side to side until I liked the way the curls were clumping. 

Out of the shower - (still upsidedown) gently add some NYM curling cream by glazing & gently scrunching.

Plop 10 min.

Diffuse. Focusing on roots, alternating moving head from side to side. *I have very fine hair so I'm working on getting volume at the roots.

‚ú®Now this next part is the hardest for me, because I haven't quite figured out how to flip my hair so that the waves to look as good right side up as opposed to upside down. 

IF YOU HAVE TIPS ON THIS PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!


Here is what I tried:
After drying the roots so that they aren't sticking to my head, I hover diffuse the waves so that they aren't sopping (scrunched a few times with a microfiber cloth) and then air dry the rest of the way, flipping my hair & part every so often so that I can retain as much volume possible.&&&I appreciate the compliments! I definitely had major grow out during covid, so it felt nice to get back to my regular shorter length. I think my waves aren't thick/defined enough to handle the weight of the length I had.

So the Pink NYM conditioner worked great for me initially when I switched from the OGX brand last summer. I noticed a my hair got drier and frizzier when the weather went from humid Texas summer to the drier fall/winter. I took advice from a post on this sub that with the NYM brand, start with the green because it is in the middle of the moisture level (pink being the highest). If you visit the NYM Instagram, there are posts that show the products lightest - heaviest. I've been using the pink for shave gel too! üòÇ&&&You should totally do it! It felt so liberating to get rid of so much hair, especially for spring!&&&‚ú®Link to previous post of where my hair started

Cashewcamera,tiltwv,"The Denman Brush has been a game changer for my waves. I have very low porosity hair and the best shampoo I have found is Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil strengthen and restore. If you are in the US it‚Äôs at most Walmarts, Targets and Walgreens.

HyperbolDee,tiltwv,"Fellow night showerer here. Best things for my hair:

- I don‚Äôt plop. I need a certain amount of water in my hair to keep some hair clumped together to avoid a stringy look, and plopping just leads to a stringy mess for me. I‚Äôll use a t-shirt to squish out some excess once I‚Äôm done in the shower, but otherwise, I strictly air dry. 

- Once I‚Äôve got my post-shower products in (leave in conditioner and mousse), and I‚Äôve squished a little for some shaping, I don‚Äôt touch it. Once again, trying to air dry as much as possible. When it‚Äôs time for bed, I gently put my hair in a ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù on top of my head, trying to still keep that crunchy cast on my hair. When I wake up in the morning, I take my hair down and, voil√†!"
OverthinkingTree,tiltwv,"I‚Äôm no expert, but your hair looks weighed down to me. I tried CGM and found that my hair had the same problem likely due to my low porosity. I‚Äôve found that less is more for me. That means shampooing a couple times a week and conditioning around every other day. Avoiding oil-based products is essential (for me!) so I have found Maui Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner to be a great lightweight option and Odele Air Dry Styler reduces frizz for air drying. Neither of those products are highly recommended from CGM community though so might just be me.&&&Also just genuinely not touching my hair much post shower has been good for me. No brushing, scrunching, etc.&&&Looking at the ingredients on the shampoo you‚Äôre using, I‚Äôm seeing lots of oil which could be your culprit of the weight. I‚Äôd love to see updates!"

kindersnitten,tii8on,"Aussie for fine wavy hair?&&&Hi! As the title says I have fine wavy hair. I‚Äôve tried a low-poo before and it didn‚Äôt work on my hair.

Or if any of u have any experience with the brand. Ty <3"
ollivana,tii8on,"Hi there! I'm Aussie too :)

This is what I'd recommend before using other products.

1. Double shampoo if you don't already
Recs: I dont have a shampoo I love yet but the Monday shampoo seems to clean my hair really well. Atm I'm using the Shiseido Rose Shampoo which I'm happy with but I've heard good things about anything from Bumble and Bumble and Kerastase. 
2. Get a clarifying shampoo to help remove some build up on your hair. This with the double shampoo should take away the flatness from your hair. 
Rec: Bumble and Bumble Sunday Shampoo

If youre getting hair loss from low poo then its pretty important you wash frequently and well to avoid hair loss.

I'm still experimenting with products for moisture, at the moment I'm using the Leave In Conditioner by Cake beauty from Priceline. If I scrunch it I get decent waves, its nice and moisturising but it's not holy grail status for me. The Cake Beauty curl mousse is also nice. It makes my hair a tad crunchy but I get good waves. 

If you blow dry your hair I'd also recommend the Bumble and Bumble Great Blow Dry Thickening Creme. It's heat activated and has helped my hair stay volumised even in our crappy weather lol. 

I highly recommend Kerastase for any moisturising masks though. They have plenty of lightweight products, it'll say in the title :) The Shiseido Rose Conditioner also leaves my hair nice and hydrated so if youre looking for a new shampoo/conditioner combo that's affordable, I'd recommend it."
