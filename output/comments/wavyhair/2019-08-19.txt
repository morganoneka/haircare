bookgrrrrrl,cu7jej,"Been using the CGM since Sunday... Happy with results so far.&&&&&&PRODUCTS USED: 
- Clarifying shampoo: Garnier Fructis
Pure Clean Shampoo (Sulfates, but NO silicone)
- Conditioner & No Poo: Tresemme Botanique Coconut
- Herbal Essences Gel: Set me up

So I did a clarifying wash + conditioner on Sunday. Washed my hair again this morning (Thursday). Used Tresemme 2X in the shower. Brushed hair in shower. Scrunched some water out. 2 dime sized squeezes of gel and scrunched on wet hair. Scrunched some more. Air dried. 

Things to note: My hair has significantly reduced frizz. Waves held all day. Feels a smidge more moisturized, a little heavy, but waves never lost shape. Pretty happy so far. Thought the gel would leave hair crunchy, it did not, but I only used a SMIDGE. All in all probably spent $16CAD total."
