H-rose098,o4i3ir,"Got about five inches cut off my hair last week! I‚Äôve noticed a big difference&&&&&&routine
Wash with shea moisture coconut curl and shine hibiscus shampoo and conditioner! I only comb my hair in the shower with a lot of conditioner in it!! I rise most of the conditioner out I leave a little in and scrunch my hair. I get out of the shower leaving my hair soaking wet and apply cantu curl activating cream with ‚Äúprayer hands‚Äùthen I use aussie instant freeze gel applying with prayer hands again after that I scrunch my hair with a tshirt or a microfiber towel then diffuse for about 10 minutes&&&I‚Äôm so glad I did it!! only downside is not all my hair fits in a bun ü§£&&&Wow thank you!!&&&Thank you so much!!

NervousOnAirplanes,o4i3ir,Wow those ringlets are to die for
Notquite_Caprogers,o4i3ir,"It's the weight. When I have my hair long it has to be layered properly to curl up. (I've started doing it myself as I start growing it out, my hair is about your length rn, just a bit longer)"
SturmFee,o4i3ir,"Hi, did you go to a normal hair stylist or someone who has experience with curly hair? I desperately need a cut as well but specialized stylists are hard to find here..."
SunshinePrincess_,o4i3ir,"How do you recommend doing the layers? I‚Äôve been cutting my own hair since I started taking care of it curly, but I haven‚Äôt truly done any layers (only cut off dead hair typically  ~1 inch at a time)"
Sylvss1011,o4i3ir,Adorable!
TheOwlSaysWhat,o4i3ir,Love both lengths but wow you look adorable with that bob!
dontmindmewhileilurk,o4i3ir,Your eye brows are amazing too!
headietoinfinity,o4i3ir,Love this! Also you would look amazing with curly bangs!
hentaivee,o4i3ir,Omg so beautifulllll
hi_im_kai101,o4i3ir,my hair is like 3/4 down my back and now i‚Äôm wondering what a large chop would do for me
idontknowwhatisb,o4i3ir,Off topic but your eyebrows are to die for they look amazing üòç
mks93,o4i3ir,"You‚Äôve tempted me so much!

I need a haircut but am afraid of missing my length!"
over_papaya,o4i3ir,You look beautiful either way but the short hair gives you such an fresh and youthful look. It really suits you!
redchai,o4i3ir,"Hello!

Just so you know, contrary to popular belief, that's not what a ""big chop"" means.

It's true that in wavy/curly communities on Instagram the term has started to live its own life, and now basically means ""cutting your hair to shoulder length as a rite of passage when following the curly girl method"".

However, the term actually originates from Black women. It means taking the hair that they had permanently relaxed (by chemicals so strong it could cause burns on the scalp) and chopping it all off to start fresh. It is a very significant moment, because it means letting go of white beauty standards and embracing natural hair instead.

Over at [r/curlyhair](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/), the community came up with the word ""reset cut"" instead, because they still wanted a word to describe a significant haircut (just because it's not a big chop, doesn't mean it's nothing!). Check out [this flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/a1fdnBW.png) to learn more about the difference between a reset cut and a big chop, and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/) to read more about the history of Black women and their hair.

We hope you understand and can use the appropriate term in the future. Thank you!"
stelliumWithin,o4i3ir,Why would it be able to curl properly if it grows from scratch? Damage? Or weight? Or habit?
wlkinginurfootsteps,o4i3ir,looks so good. I just  chopped off a bunch of hair too. it's fun!!! nothing beats healthy ends and more wave/curl action poppin off
yosha_no_2,o4i3ir,So cute! üòç
Otherwise_Egg_4413,o4ftq1,"week 2 of CGM my hair is starting to get twisty spirals again like it did before extreme bleach damage, hard to get a good picture&&&&&&Thank you! I shampoo and deep condition on Tuesday and Friday with ion hard water shampoo and hair chemist hydrate hair mask with coconut oil, and then I use Shea moisture red palm and coco butter leave in conditioner, then I plop. I usually get my hair wet and reapply more leave in conditioner in the morning to get rid of friz"
emlikestea,o4ftq1,It looks so good! Could you post your routine; your hair looks really similar to mine.
Botanisosurus_Rex,o4f8r1,"What's everyone's moment in their journey that makes them happy?&&&I had a young child at work told me she ""loves my curl hair"" and that just made me so happy! Probably my happiest moment in this whole journey. An unsolicited compliment calling my hair curly. And children rarely have filters so they tell the truth.

So now I'm wondering, what is everyone else's that makes them happy or is similar?"
FairyRosebuds,o4f8r1,"In my home country I think the beauty standar is to have silky, tamed hair. I travel abroad and strangers would stop me in the street to compliment my hair! Then I understood beauty is totally relative and that my hair can and is beautiful ü•∞"
Wavy-and-wispy,o4f8r1,I‚Äôve had people ask how I curl my hair or ‚Äúis that just how your hair naturally is??‚Äù I always love the shock on their face when I say it‚Äôs natural. I feel so blessed with my waves! (Certainly didn‚Äôt always feel that way!)
mimiweasley,o4f8r1,"When I started to truly believe when other people said my hair was beautiful. As a teenager I was always trying to straight my hair and almost combing my soul out of my body to make it straighter. I don't feel like a stranger anymore in my wavy hair, and even though it took me almost twenty years, learning to embrace it and love it the way it is has made me really, really happy!"
Feisty-Sherbert,o4bsin,"Before and after scrunching out the crunch because it‚Äôs so satisfying&&&&&&My hair is pretty fine but I have a decent amount of it (medium to thick/dense). I used to have 2b-3a but after bleaching last summer my hair tends to sit around 2a-2b with the occasional 2c. Porosity used to be very very low, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more medium after bleaching. 

Routine today:

Wash with Ion Hard Water Shampoo (i use this as needed; usually I use a prescription shampoo once a week and Briogeo Superfoods green shampoo for my other washes). 

Condition with Briogeo superfoods green conditioner. Rinse out fully and scrunch/squish out some water. 

Apply DevaCurl Wavemaker on wet hair upside-down. Apply Miss Jessie‚Äôs Jelly Soft Curls using the glazing then scrunch method. Scrunch with a microfiber towel to encourage the curl and then plop for just a couple minutes while I get dressed and whatnot. 

I take my hair out of the towel and once my hair is like damp rather than wet, I add a bit more gel (glaze and scrunch) and then air dry. Controversial opinion, but my hair actually does best if I continue to scrunch as it dries. My hair is easily weighed down even by the weight of being wet so my waves get stretched out. Regular scrunching as it dries keeps the waves from falling out, plus it adds volume. I can get a little frizzy, but I‚Äôd prefer that over limp waves. 

Once it‚Äôs dry, I scrunch out any crunch, flip upside down and ruffle the roots, etc. Sometimes I‚Äôll use a hairspray, but I didn‚Äôt get a chance to today. 

Note: I used Olaplex No. 3 yesterday."
UnfairForever2505,o49rjr,Noughty Detox Dynamo Clarifying Shampoo
camus-is-absurd,o49rjr,"Sulfate free clarifying shampoo?&&&I was all low poo way before going wavy because sulfates give me cystic acne. I have sulfate free toothpaste and don‚Äôt even use it on my body. 

I thought it would be ok once or twice a month, but now that I‚Äôve clarified my hair a couple times, the acne is back üò©

Is the Kinky Curly Come Clean clarifying? Or does anyone have any other recommendations? My skin just hates sulfates I guess."
hiholahihey,o49rjr,"I‚Äôve used the Come Clean, it‚Äôs alright. Right now I‚Äôm using the living proof detox shampoo. It‚Äôs expensive but it does work really well. I‚Äôve tried so many clarifying shampoos too."
SpicyCactusSuccer,o45phs,I love this haircut on you! And your waves are so lovely!
ValentineTarantula,o45phs,Your waves look lovely but I have to compliment the baby bangs. I really hope these come back into style something fierce because they're the best.
ayychee,o45phs,"First time trying to style my newly wgm hair‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe how much volume I didn‚Äôt know I had!&&&&&&Thank you! It‚Äôs so difficult to get reference photos to show stylists what I want (they always cut them too long) that isn‚Äôt a picture of a grunge band groupie from the 90s. But get yourself some! I love them! And if you‚Äôre lazy like me, you can have a temporary new look as they grow towards your brows between trims.&&&Right now I'm using Real Raw Collagen Curls Low Poo Shampoothie combed in with a tangle teezer, then same for a round of Real Raw Collagen Curls Conditioner that I rinse, then do a S2C with the conditioner, micro plop. This was my first time trying out NYT Curl Talk mousse that I mixed with Pantene Pro V Volume gel that I'm using up from my past life! I glazed those on, scrunched, plopped for 30, then diffused and SOTC!

Edit: Oh! I also made a spray with water, lavender oil, a little conditioner and sea salt that I spritz on throughout the day!"
thots_nprayers,o45phs,"This haircut suits you so well, and the waves are chefs kiss üëåüèº good job!! isn‚Äôt it fun to suddenly have all kinds of volume that you always wish you had when you used to beat your hair into submission so it would be straight? üò¨ especially when you have hair on the finer side. my hair is thin from Hashimotos disease (thyroid) and my waves are everything to me haha."
barathro,o3yx1t,"Have you tried gel on reeeeally wet hair? Like still dripping? And have you tried not plopping? For me if i plop, or if I try to dry them a bit with a towel without any holding products on the hair, the clumps get destroyed"
for_no_one_else,o3yx1t,I have always had super thick hair. It since realizing it was wavy and treating it with wavy products it feels so much thinner. Also I can‚Äôt get clumpy waves no matter what I try and they look so stringy!&&&&&&For context I‚Äôve been trying to go curly since February and this is my Routine. I wash my hair with the function of beauty wavy shampoo. Then I squish to consist with the NYM curl talk conditioner and comb through it with a wide tooth comb. Then I use a microfiber towel to get some of the moisture out of my hair and I will had mousse from roots to tip for volume. Then I scrunch In a twisted sister curl cream and a NYM curl cream. Then I plop it. Then I take the plop down and dry more with a microfiber towel. Then I plop again.
littleprojects,o3yx1t,I would honestly only use curl cream as a first step! I feel like using it after mousse might not work as well? But maybe someone with better knowledge/luck than I have could give their two cents!
queenshortcoming,o3yx1t,I think those waves are very beautiful--not stringy at all!! I can tell you though that plopping that much would probably break up anyone's clumps.
squawkamolee,o3xpuc,"Success!! Layered hair cut works wonders!&&&&&&So on a whim I got my friend (not a hairdresser at ALL) to attempt to cut layers. She had never cut hair before. But as you can see it went very well.

All I did to achieve this was wash my hair with some random drug store shampoo, (I was just trying to get off all the little hairs that has stuck to my scalp when she cut it, I think it was Aussie Smoothing shampoo,) threw it up in a tee shirt for a bit, then took that out and went to bed with damp hair. Woke up with this. I‚Äôve posted a lot here, maybe you recognize my hair, and that I‚Äôve Never seen ANYTHING LIKE THIS before I had these layers."
KillerAc1,o3xb4n,It‚Äôs okay man I just came looking here myself. I‚Äôve just started my hair care journey and I‚Äôm really lost on what to do with my hair.
Rainbow-Wuggly,o3xb4n,"Confused&&&Why is there mostly ladies here? I thought there would be at least SOME men or boys that have wavy hair. Like myself, I am a male who has naturally wavy hair but I cut most of my hair off so yk the waves aren‚Äôt really there anymore. üò≠&&&Oh, I‚Äôve been researching on hair types and products they need, I‚Äôve just started as well but I know a lot, I‚Äôm still learning though. Uhm what‚Äôs your hair type? üòÄ"
pulang_panda,o3wacf,"[1C/2A] Cake Wave Maker is a 4/5 in my book!&&&&&&I went down the sugar spray rabbit hole after getting a blunt cut and gel started weighing my hair down. A side part and a generous spritz of Wave Maker brought my texture back! This is Day 2 and it's gotten ever wavier imo.

ROUTINE: Shampoo with Dove Weightless Moisture shampoo, S2C upright with Garnier Ultra Light conditioner, cold water rinse while scrunching, microplop with microfiber towel, diffuse roots and nape (my 1C layer), section off and lightly spray lengths with Wave Maker, air dry.

PRODUCT REVIEW: Wave Maker smells like vanilla cupcakes, and in my experience, the scent lasts until the next day if you use enough. The nozzle doesn't mist so much as blast‚Äîmy least favorite thing about this product‚Äîso you have to hold it about a foot away and spray in short bursts for even application. It works better on skinnier clumps than big ones. Simply dampen your hair with a mister to refresh; add more product with a light hand if needed."
WeAreStarless,o3th1n,"yeah, that's totally possible! the highlights will cause that top section to be of a higher porosity. if they behave really differently, maybe it would work to apply your styling products in sections?"
amjt24,o3th1n,"Mixed porosity?&&&Is it possible to have mixed porosity hair? I have thin 2a/b hair and a lot of it. The top sections have been highlighted for many years, but the lower half or more is virgin hair. I feel as though the top section behaves totally differently with products than the bottom. Anyone else have this issue? Is there a good styling technique to combat?"
