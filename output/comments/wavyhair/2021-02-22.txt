ElleDeeNS,lu1t7d,I just use some light Moroccan Oil.
Snowstig,lu1t7d,"What brand?  Is it CG?&&&I am also looking for a light oil to SOTC with that is curly girl friendly.  I just tried jojoba oil and it made my fine, low porosity 2a -2b waves super oily and I only used a couple drops.  Ended up putting my hair up and washing again the next day.  I had been using OGX penetrating argan oil and loved it, but it's not CG.  Maybe going to try pure argan oil, moringa oil, or vitamin e oil.  Anyone have experience with any of those?"
blckrainbow,lu1t7d,"None, just hands!"
lazyeggg,lu1t7d,What's your favorite oil to scrunch out the crunch?&&&
mini_khaleesi,lu1t7d,Olaplex
neverseektotell,lu1t7d,I like sweet almond but you have to be super light
uwuoona,lu1t7d,"I have heard that jojoba oil is the closest to the oil your body naturally produces, so I use that on my hair. It‚Äôs also good for skin and nails!"
Creative-Damage404,ltxmai,"Heeelp how do I keep my hair out of my face while it‚Äôs drying?&&&&&&My routine was pre condition and detangle with the rest of my Free and Clear conditioner, shampoo and scrub the roots with Free and Clear Shampoo, Condition with Suave Essentials Coconut, Squish, brush, squish, leave to soak a few minutes, wash out, squish a quarter size dollop of Cantu Shea Butter leave-in into my hair and brush through, squish some more, squish a palmful Free and Clear gel into my hair, scrunch with a cotton tee and the plop for 10 minutes before leaving it to air dry. This is a new technique I‚Äôm trying and so far it‚Äôs working to give me some pretty tight waves compared to my normal texture. 
Sadly my hair keeps getting in my face and I push it out of the way and end up messing the waves up x.x&&&Can you link me to a set on amazon I‚Äôm not sure which ones are considered root clips."
Ima_Jenn,ltxmai,"Root clips.

Mine look like these. You want Double Prong (no bar between prongs).

helliebell3,ltxmai,Try root clipping! I like using small jaw clips; it helps me get some volume and keep it out of my face.
Dollparts___,ltwyee,Try a wide tooth comb. I find brushing definitely makes my hair way more frizzy and I can‚Äôt wear it down if I do!
Istinline,ltwyee,"I brush in the shower to distribute conditioner and then use a denman brush to style. 

I know some curlies who dry brush before they wash. Hair is weakest when it is wet so the idea is to detangle while your hair is strong to avoid breakage. 

GenaMarie on Instagram has a process when she dry detangles with oil before shampoo but she has higher porosity hair."
PersonUsingComputer_,ltwyee,"To Brush or Not to Brush&&&Hi, I have long wavy hair. These days I never brush my hair, but I finger detangle when conditioning in the bath. Should I be brushing my hair? Will brushing make my hair more frizzy or less frizzy?"
PokeballGrinder,ltwyee,"I only brush outside of the shower if I'm going to be straightening my hair, it makes it very frizzy initially. Otherwise I keep a tangle teaser in the bath for when I condition."
-kidsonleashes-,ltwq6y,"I have the same issue, but straight on top. I would like to know as well."
Istinline,ltwq6y,"It‚Äôs very common to have different patterns on your head. The underside layer can sometimes be lower porosity and less damaged than the top layer. This means sectioning and using different products for your top and bottom layer could help as they will likely need different things. 

Have you tried styling with a brush or upside down or using a hard hold gel? These methods may help encourage more uniformity with your curls. 

Good luck!"
drkengard,ltwq6y,"Hair is curly on top but straight on bottom&&&I shampoo every time I shower because my hair gets oily and weighed down often, but only use a clarifying shampoo once every three weeks or so (Even the clarifying wash doesn‚Äôt fix the straight hair). 
Then I condition or deep condition, squish to condish, then squish in Knot Today leave in cream and rinse out any excess. 
After I get out of the shower, I squeeze a bit of extra water out of my hair, then I apply Not Your Mother‚Äôs curl talk cream and Curls Blueberry Bliss gel while my hair is very wet. Then I‚Äôll plop for about 10-15 minutes, take my hair out, neaten/arrange it a little, and air dry.
When my hair is still damp, I‚Äôll diffuse it. I diffuse the bottom layer too. 
But no matter what, the bottom layer of my hair always comes out straight. ): 
I‚Äôve been trying out different products, so the post shower cream and gel are in a trial phase right now. 

Has anyone else seen/experienced this issue and found a way to get volume and curls there?&&&I never considered using different products before. I do have a hard hold gel, so I‚Äôll try using more of that on the bottom layer. I could try curling sections around my finger to hopefully make it hold shape. I was using prayer hands but now that I think about it, that‚Äôs probably straightening out the bottom layer even more. 

What kind of products do you think would be better for the top vs the bottom layer? My hair gets weighed down pretty easily (type 2B hair with high porosity).  
Also, by styling with a brush, do you mean a denman brush?&&&It‚Äôs really a struggle!! I‚Äôll let you know if I find any good ways to help fix it"

heathgamb,ltwq5f,Your hair is gorgeous! What styling products do you use?
elleresscidee,ltugmh,"Products with water soluble silicones?&&&I've noticed that since I totally removed silicones from my hair routine, my waves have gotten nicer, my hair feels moisturized, but my frizz levels are a little out of control. I've always dealt with frizz, but not to this level. I can kinda control the frizz by using lots of product, but this causes really fast build up, as I need to add more every day. I've tried glycerin-free products too, but I could still use some help. Just as an experiment, I returned to my old shampoo and conditioner (Redken Frizz dismiss) for a wash day. My waves definitely aren't as nice, but the frizz is so much better! I've been reading up on the benefits and differences between different types of silicones, and I think I'd like to give a product a try that has water-soluble silicones in it.  Any suggestions? I'm thinking I'd like to try a leave-in conditioner, but I'm open to suggestions! Also, I *think* my hair does better without proteins, but I'm still struggling to figure this piece out.

Routine:
-Cowash with Suave Tropical Coconut Conditioner every 4ish days  
-Clarify every 3-4 washes with Suave Clarifying Shampoo  
-Leave-in conditioners: I have Curls Blueberry and Kinky Curly Knot Today...I think the Kinky Curly (no protein) is better for my hair, but they both seem to enhance the waves to some extent  
-Scrunch with Tresemme TRES gel, extra firm, with a t-shirt  
-Air dry and scrunch out the crunch&&&Thank you! Yes, I started with the Blueberry bliss leave-in because I thought I needed protein, and then I got the Kinky Curly one to see if I just needed moisture and no protein. I was having trouble figuring out whether I need protein or not because my hair doesn't seen to fit well into any of the descriptions I read. I *think* it does slightly better without, so I'm going that route and I'll see how it goes!"
ftr-mmrs,ltugmh,"Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle is a styling gel that is glycerin-free, protein-free and has a peg modified cone. Curl Junkie Beauticurl Leave-in is also glycerin and protein free.

marblehead23,ltthtt,"I got more crunch with the Spiralicious than the   Rockin Ringlets, and Rockin Ringlets also has a thinner consistency. That being said, I have a lot of hair and it‚Äôs more on the coarse side (I think I probably have 2b or 2c waves though). So I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôd have the same experience with the products. You might already know this, but they offer a couple sample sizes if you just want to try them (a small ‚Äúpacket‚Äù size or a small bottle). Good luck!"
mother-of-bugs,ltthtt,I'd suggest getting all of their free sample packets. You just have to pay for shipping. Then you can try them all without committing yet. üòä
xcptnl55,ltthtt,I use both.  Rockin ringlets first then spiralicious.  Rocking ringlets does not have enough hold for me.

GothAdjacent,lto889,Did you used to style the front of your hair differently or more? Did you heat style or just happen to brush it more before starting?
vmartinipie,lto889,"A couple options, hard to know without more details about your routine and application techniques:

-Your hair is more damaged in this area 

-You are applying more product to the back of your hair due to your method

-You might simply need more product or to do finger coiling or another method there to get the same results, due to damage or just mixed curl pattern"

Old-Neighborhood-792,ltalnr,"Never heard of Ecoslay but the products seems to be very well liked on their website.

This is a way of strengthening you hair right?&&&I tried the shea moisture manuka honey and yogurt hydrate and repair,  but I didn't see no results that's why I was curious as to what your hair suppose to feel look like after a protein treatment.

I'm going to try the palmer's coconut oil deep conditioning protein pack today and see what that does. Not sure if it cgm approved."
SweetNSauerkraut,ltalnr,"My hair is low porosity, coarse, high density, 2c and hates protein. My holy grail is uncle funky‚Äôs daughter curl magic. It‚Äôs a great one and done styler and it makes my hair dry faster. Some people get flash drying due to the aloe in it."

goldengirlsmom,ltalnr,"Bar shampoo. I recently bought the viori shampoo i kept seeing on Facebook thinking maybe it was scammy, and to my surprise I absolutely love it. As someone who washes her hair daily because I wake up and feel greasy plus bedhead, this stuff has totally transformed my weighed down hair. Trust me, I've tried expensive stuff and lots of products before.

Other than that I just do a little bit of gel when it's still wet and diffuse it."
rmg1102,ltalnr,"I have semi-fine medium density low porosity hair

I LOVE the NYM blue sea kale coconut water conditioner - I have yet to try the shampoo bc it‚Äôs was sold out at my Ulta. 

My favorite styler is MA Cake Curl Mousse I great definition without weighing my hair down. I also have the MA Cake Curl Cream which I usually use when air drying

I have the blueberry bliss leave in and I really like it - I use a pea size amount and warm it in my hands on soaking wet hair. It really helps with clumping! It has some protein in it and I think it‚Äôs the only protein product I use - idk if I should try others haha. 

I have the Miss Jessie‚Äôs jelly soft curls and I still don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. I get good definition but wish I had tried a hard hold gel as my first gel - this one doesn‚Äôt give me a great cast and my hair really seems to like having a cast. I find this gel works better when I use wet hands and emulsify the gel. 

Technique wise - I try to squish water out at all stages of application. Even doing that I still apply my products to soaking wet hair. Both wet plopping and microplopping help cut my drying time. I pixie diffuse because it helps my hair shrink up (it‚Äôs long) and seems to go by faster."
snarktini,ltalnr,"I'm 2b/c, fine, extremely dense, low porosity. 

My hair is super thirsty and -- despite weekly deep deep conditioning with heat -- is barely ever moisturized enough, so that dictates most of my choices. My hair needs moisture but if I lock it in it will NEVER DRY.  I want some definition generally but prefer volume. Oh, and my hair doesn't like protein very much either. That's what I'm working with. 

Typically damp application is my friend. Wet application gives me better definition and curl, but the dry time is ridiculous. Plopping for 5-10 minutes before adding gel is the best compromise. I go back and forth and have been in a wet-style phase, using less hydrating stylers like Rockin Ringlets and Spiralicious, but I'm about to switch back. 

My love-hate is Ecoslay Orange Marmalade. It is the absolute best enhancing, one-and-done styler I've found. And it doesn't weigh me down if I stick to a few (3-5) pumps. But it does massively increase my drying time. üò¢ 

When I need a detangler without weight, the NYM Tahitian or Desert Melon sprays are the lightest I've found. Jessicurl Deep Condition and Ecoslay Banana Creme are great for deep hydration without weight or protein. Curl Junkie Repair Me for protein and mega slip. Personally, I find that conditioner doesn't weigh down my hair at all and in fact gives me bigger, bouncier waves. It's the stylers I have to go light on!&&&Let me just say that I am completely opposed to buying anything for my body, face, or hair that has to be refrigerated and has a short shelf life so i avoided Ecoslay at first...but once I tried they won me over. Their stuff is definitely worth storing in my fridge. (And I do like that the short shelf life means there's hardly anything in it. I'm not afraid of chemicals by any means but fewer, natural ingredients is ideal.)

If you don't know if your hair likes protein, you could start with a bottle of Neutral Protein Filler at the beauty supply store. You add it to your existing products, and it's a really cheap way to experiment with how much and where to use it. For example, I've learned my hair can only tolerate protein in rinse-out products. Just be careful with it. Use only a few drops at first, and mix your conditioner/gel with the NPF in your hand or a bowl. Never add it to the bottle. You can use more in rinse-out products than leave-in."

I clarified a couple of times ( I typically clarify every couple of weeks), but it dried out my hair and I ended up with a very dry and itchy scalp.  Was just browsing at CVS and saw this scalp care cleansing oil from NYM.  I've used it for two wash days now, and wow!!! My hair has never felt so clean, light, and soft.  My waves are so much bouncier while still retaining definition, and I'm happy with the volume.  Last time I used this product, I was even able to add a day more than usual between washes because my hair still felt so light and clean. The scalp itchiness has practically disappeared.

I would normally feel weird urging people to go out and buy anything, especially because I tend to get caught up in the illusive chase of holy grail products, spend too much money, and fill up my bathroom with half-used bottles, but I know that product build-up can be a big issue for wavies, so I wanted to let you all know how helpful this was for me.

Routine: Apply and scrub in NYM Scalp Care Cleansing Oil.  Wash hair with Giovanni 2Chic Ultra-Revive Shampoo (a fairly moisturizing shampoo, so as not to strip my hair too much). Condition with Hask Biotin Boost Conditioner.  Comb through with wet brush.  Apply Aussie Insta-Freeze gel with praying hands.  Comb through with wet brush again.
