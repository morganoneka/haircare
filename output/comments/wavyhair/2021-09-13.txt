JapaneseStudentHaru,prj0il,Typically you use both but with the wavy styling method you have product protection. I cover my strands in gel and then diffuse on low power and med-high heat for a minute or two until the gel sets and my hair is dry. No heat means gel doesn‚Äôt really work!
MsSureFire,prj0il,"^ This

Straight heat on hair with no product to protect it from heat is *extremely* damaging. It's better to use no heat at all, but if you want to use heat tools, some sort of product designed to help protect and shield your hair from heat is very important. It's also best to use the lowest heat setting needed to get the hair that you want.

There are dozens of ways to get defined curls with just products and techniques (wet brush styles, pin curls, etc), no heat needed. Mousse helps create volume and hold hair shape when dry.

I have read that if you have pin straight hair, products and heat are necessary to get any sort of curls/waves that will stay."
Pyralene78,prj0il,To what extent is gel/mousse healthier than heat solutions for wavy hair?&&&I told my straight-haired mother that i wanted to try adding hair mousse to my routine. She keeps objecting  that using hair products other than shampoo and conditioner on a regular basis would damage my hair in the long run and that I should use the curling iron if i want more defined curls some days. So I thought I could ask you guys to help me give her the pros and cons of these two solutions :)
speakthen,prj0il,Heat is definitely worse than mousse or gel. Heat damaged hair doesn‚Äôt curl/wave as much. I‚Äôve been using mousse and curl cream for like 20 years and have never had a problem.
BlinkerBeforeBrake,priy7m,"Made some routine changes - before and after pics!&&&&&&I just moved to the west in an arid climate, and have been toying with my routine for a few months. Today I switched it up and I think it worked! Namely, I stopped using my hands for everything, and only diffused the troublesome part of my hair. 

1. Shampoo with Loma Daily Shampoo
2. Condition with Loma Daily Conditioner (replace with Mixed Chicks deep conditioner once a week). Comb through using a wide tooth comb until it runs through smoothly. Do not touch!!
3. Rinse in cool water. Leave soaking wet for the next step. 
4. Section the top and bottom layer of my hair, apply gel to all sections (adding a bit more to the bottom). Comb through. No scrunching/touching!
5. Micro plop using a cotton tee shirt before leaving the shower. 
6. Put hair into microfiber turbie twist for 5-10 minutes.
7. Diffuse upside down only. Just to get the scalp and anything that‚Äôs not exposed naturally to the air dry.
8. Let the rest of my hair air dry. 
9. Scrunch out the crunch using the same cotton tee shirt.

Now, I just need to figure out how to get the volume back in my hair! ;) Any advice is appreciated!"

breadpresidents,prdnny,"I have to keep my hair natural so it's less obvious I cut it myself.&&&&&&Im new to this sub and my wavy hair routine in general, but ill explain it the best I can!
My routine:
1. Wash with Neutrogena clarifying shampoo (right now I wash every other day).
2. I normally don't use conditioner in the shower, but when I get out I use Creame of Nature leave in conditioner.
3. Brush my hair and part it, then scrunch it a little bit and let it air dry.

Normally it seems that sleeping in it is what brings out the waves. Looks not so great when I go to bed, but way better in the morning."

BitterCabbageSoup,pras7b,"I can relate to this, I hated mousse the first time I tried it and now it's the product I use the most"
Feisty-Sherbert,pras7b,"Reminder to retry products that didn‚Äôt work for you!&&&I have always HATED mousse. Never worked for me. Made my hair stringy and undefined, despite having fine hair and everyone telling me to use mousse. 

Last night, I showered late and decided to try my mousse again because why not? I was going to sleep with wet hair which always messed up my hair anyway, so I had nothing to lose. 

Well, by the time I went to sleep with damp hair, my hair was more defined than usual. I assumed it would be flattened and nearly straight in the morning like usual. To my surprise, I woke up with more waves than I ever wake up with. I did a quick refresh by spraying with water and scrunching a tiny bit of leave in, and my hair looks the best it‚Äôs ever looked.

I‚Äôd forgotten that hair needs change, and other aspects of a routine can affect whether something works for you!

Routine: last night was my medicated shampoo night (Nizoral). Usually I‚Äôd use Briogeo Apple and Kale shampoo though. Condition with Briogeo Apple conditioner avoiding my roots. Rinse out, apply Deva Curl Wavemaker to dripping wet hair, flip and apply mousse, then plop for 20 mins and air dry (and sleep on it lol)

ETA: forgot to mention, the mousse is NYM Curl Talk mousse.&&&Best of luck! I tried it again this morning and obviously there‚Äôs some troubleshooting (I put in too much), it‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs going to work well for me with how my hair has progressed!"

HonestlyRespectful,pr7pbq,"Yep, this. Everything you're using is too moisturizing. You need to find a gel or mousse with no humectants that will give you a hard cast, or your results will be continue to be what they've been. Oiudad has a humidity defying gel or if you want to try something cheap, just to see if it works, try LA Looks sport gel, it's blue. Good luck!"
JapaneseStudentHaru,pr7pbq,"Nothing seems to work! Help with my routine?&&&So, I‚Äôve been absolutely coating my hair in gel (curlsmith) lately and setting it with heat on low with a diffuser. This makes for a good cast, but as soon as I go outside I get frizz and my curls deflate. It‚Äôs a bit humid here. I‚Äôm not sure what to do to prevent this!

Routine:

Wash and condition with Maui Moisture lightweight hydration. Use Eva-NYE protein mask if needed.

Apply curlsmith gel with my hair upside down. Coat from roots to tip. Then squish my hair into one clump and scrunch to form bigger curls. (Have done this method with and without curl cream) Plop for 3-5 minutes with cotton shirt (I got thick hair lol)

Release hair upside down, scrunch out moisture with shirt and diffuse on medium heat and low speed.

Turn upright and part hair. Then diffuse on high heat and low speed to set gel until my hair is mostly dry. Scrunch out when completely dry. (Note: my hell doesn‚Äôt form a complete cast of my hair with this method. Some pieces are soft when done drying.)

This gives a pretty good result but my hair is puffy. Not set like at the salon. I‚Äôve tried cold or medium heat for the process but that doesn‚Äôt set my cast at all. I‚Äôve also tried mousse (NYM) and other gels (NYM, Miss Jessie‚Äôs, Cantu). 

What should I try?"
shattered_illusions,pr7pbq,"For a humid climate you need to avoid humectants like they are the plague. Both Maui Moisture and Curlsmith have humectants in the top 5 ingredients. (For Maui Moisture the humectant is the first ingredient!) All the other gels you mentioned also have humectants in the top 5 ingredients. Humectants are all well and good in ideal dew points (between 35F and 60F), but will give you a ton of frizz outside of that range.

Switch both your conditioner and gel (and any leave in you decide you might want to try) to a humectant free one while the dew points at your location remain outside the ideal range."

OatmealCookieGirl,pr443e,"Good news and bad news. Please help!&&&I posted this elsewhere too, but perhaps one of you might have experience with this...

Good news:  I THOUGHT I was mostly 2b, perhaps 2c with some spirals...But looking at today's pic I might have curlier hair than I thought!

Bad news: 
They say that if your hair is a very soft and glossy but  a bit limp it needs protein, and that straw-like, dull hair needs moisture. My hair is super soft and pretty glossy, but has been a but limp lately...I read that protein could help give my curl-waves some more ""bounce"" and help combat the weight caused by length...And I colour my hair...So I tried a ""repair"" protein treatment. I didn't notice improvement so I tested my hair and it turns out, I think my hair had too much protein and now has protein overload!!! It instantly snaps if I pull.
I had no idea you could have protein overload with soft, glossy hair! 
I instantly washed my hair again, delicately, and put on moisturising products (most of my normal products had some protein, but I did have protein-free shampoo, conditioner, a moisturising mask, mousse and gelee handy, thankfully)

This pic is the result. 
My hair curls more this wash day than normally, especially at the ends, but now I don't know if this is the moisture or the protein overload. I almost think I might have 3a-ish hair if it were shorter in this picture! Is that completely incorrect? It still is snapping woth no elasticity.

I am getting a curly cut on the 29th, but I don't want to go short ...
How long does it normally take to recuperate from protein overload? Or does it just need to be snipped away?
Do you have any advice, please?

Thanks

Ajjeetaem,pr3xup,"How to maintain wavy when working out.&&&Hey, guys I recently have been working out for the past few weeks. Do you guys have any tips for maintaining the wave?"
Mombod666,pr3xup,"I workout hard 6 days a week and walk my dog a few miles on the seventh day and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs impossible. 

My hair goes like this:
Day 1: wear it down it‚Äôs super wavy
Day 2: wear it down it‚Äôs loose beachy waves
Day 3: wear it up or in a braid or with a hat or something
Day 4: wash my hair after my morning workout to make it day 1 again."
hazardzetforward,pr3xup,"If I'm working out at home and don't care what I look like, I will do a very loose pony tail with an invisibobble, and then use a claw clip to clip the tail part on top of my head so it's not swinging around. If I'm running, I just plan to wash and style afterwards, as I have yet to find a way to salvage my hair post-run. I would also recommend putting in a little bit of dry shampoo before starting your workout. Easier for it to absorb sweat as you go, then trying to do it after."
maraq,pr3xup,"I refresh after my workout if it's not a wash day. I'll use a dry shampoo (right now I'm liking bumble and bumble pret a powder post workout dry shampoo mist which I can apply directly to sweaty hair), then spritz a little extra water on the drier parts of my hair, smooth out any frizz with my hands and then scrunch in a tiny bit of conditioner, and diffuse or let air dry. Sometimes, I'll also put the tiniest bit of gel or mousse if I want more hold - but a lot of times scrunching in some conditioner and some water is enough to reactivate yesterday's products and redefine everything."
vmartinipie,pr3xup,I do a loose pineapple and then use a mini goody claw to hold it in place for stuff like hatha yoga. If I‚Äôm doing anything harder than Pilates I just plan for it to be a wash day. No way to rescue truly sweaty hair without washing that I‚Äôve found.

PleasurePunch,pqzfse,"Rate my routine?&&&Hello Wavies! 

Working on my curly wavy journey, and trying to pick more accurate products for my fine, 2B/2C, medium density, and I think low porosity hair type.

\-  Maui Moisture Flexible Hold + Coconut Milk Curl Foam Mousse

\-  Design Essentials Agave & Lavender Moisturizing Blow Dry and Styling Primer

\-  OUIDAD Advanced Climate Control Featherlight Styling Cream

\*Denman Brush 7 row (I think)\*

Finish with OUIDAD Curl Shaper Out Of Thin (H) air Volumizing Jelly, and plop for about 10-20 minutes then fairy and hover diffusing. 

I'm also looking for a good finishing oil if you have a favorite. 

Thank you in advance for the advice!&&&Ok great, thanks for that info! I'm getting all of the products in the next couple days so I'll play around and see which process works best!"
pjj165,pqzfse,"The primer and/or cream should be the first thing you apply, not the mousse. You probably don‚Äôt need both the primer and cream, so pick which one works better for you. Then brush, add the jelly and then mousse (or the other way around, whatever works better for you). Mousse tends to be best last because it doesn‚Äôt need as much water as the other products do in order to distribute it evenly. You end up losing some water through the first few steps. Oil is typically used last to seal in moisture, and benefits high porosity hair more so than low porosity hair. However, it‚Äôs also good for adding shine to your style. If you decide you want to include that step, go for one of the more lightweight oils like pure jojoba, grape seed, or argan oil, and avoid the heavier ones like castor, coconut, or olive oil"

To combats this, I‚Äôve started spraying a little hairspray on my hair after I have styled while my hair is still wet, then dry as usual.

bright_star0,pqrxik,People with fine hair and low porosity how do you give volume to your hair?&&&Do you use any specific product for volume? I read that sea salt spray could be good for my hair but not sure about it.&&&What mousse do you use?&&&Which sea salt spray do you use?
jesseka320,pqrxik,Do you also use gel?
maraq,pqrxik,less product than I think I need + diffusing to at least 50% dry= more volume.
menchekia,pqrxik,Sometimes I just need a little more volume on top.  I use volume sprays.  I currently like Ouai's Texturizing Spray.  It's a cross between dry shampoo & hairspray & it's great.
mencryforme5,pqrxik,"I don't have issues with volume since I also have dense hair, but if I use gel and/or style from soaking wet, I have the worst flat hair with no life. It just hangs and looks greasy and not it.

I have good luck with sea salt spray and mousse, but I tend to style from dry or damp, and don't use tons of products."
ydnas618,pqrxik,"Using water-based products are best, as well as mousse or foams. Using as little product as possible is also best if your hair is fine or weighed down easily. Diffusing is great for adding volume. I like to diffuse with my hair flipped upside down and until my hair is between 80% to 90% dry."
