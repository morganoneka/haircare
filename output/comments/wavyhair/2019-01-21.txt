1agomorph,aj7pyp,"Not sure exactly what the problem is that you're describing. Is the photo here of your hair when wet? It's hard to diagnose anything from it if so. Would need to see your hair dry.

Crunchy would point to too much product if you have tried sufficiently ""scrunching out the crunch"" and it won't soften up. Piecy sounds like it's being weighed down too much. Perhaps your hair is too fine for heavy treatments like a leave-in conditioner. Mine is like that, I have to really go easy on leave-ins and gels. 

I wash out all conditioner in the shower otherwise it'll weigh my hair down. After the shower, I only use a leave-in (Shea moisture curl smoothie) in very small amounts, well diluted, on the ends of my hair. Gel just weighs my hair down. To keep the curls, I have to wet my hair daily with either a spray bottle or soak the ends in the shower and reapply curl smoothie. Otherwise the curls lose their shape. "
MrsEberiel,aj7pyp,"I won't give up&&&&&&I have been trying for the weeks to figure this out. Lately my hair has been crunchy, piece-y, and just not pretty. 

I'm 2b with fine hair but I'm not sure about porosity. I had a Deva cut last weekend. I'm using Deva curl no poo, one conditioner delight, the light defining gel, and a touch of the bleave in. Air dry. 

Today I decided to start over. I think I was using to much product. So I cleansed with a clarifying shampoo and the one conditioner. Then a little gel. I'm on the way to bed. 

Fingers crossed. I will post a photo in the morning. Do any of you have this problem? What have you done to help? Recommendation s welcome. "
