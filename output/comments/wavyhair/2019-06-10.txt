Cissycat12,c136m7,I too found layers help to keep the waves defined and hide the inevitable softening of the waves throughout the day. My layers are point cut and not blunt. I also found using too many smoothing or frizz-fighting products will weigh down my waves and cause them to fall flat faster.
lhaynie,c136m7,"What is your hair type? What gel are you using?

I have very thick, fine hair. If I do not keep A TON of layers in my cut, the curls easily get weighed down. This even happens when I'm in need of a trim. 

You have to experiment with types and amounts of gel. Maybe you already have... I still can't figure out what works best. I was using ouidad gel for classic curls (they have one for waves) and it worked really well without having to use a lot. Now I'm using LA Looks blue gel and I use so much but it will hold all day. I prefer ouidad but it's more expensive and the LA Looks seems to be so many people's go-to so I wanted to try it. Uve also tried Herbal Essences Totally Twisted gel and mousse. Neither were that great but the mousse works really well for some people."
megb108,c136m7,"Flat hair by noon&&&Hey, hoping I could get some advice on a problem I’m having. I usually wake up with beautiful set waves but as I move around and go about my day, my hair unravels into being flat and straight up top and extremely frizzing and poofy at the bottom. Even if I sleep in braids and hair spray/styling gel them, they still unravel in the same way. Anyone else have this issue? Any solutions?&&&My hair type is also a thick and fine 2B. I usually put layrite pomade into my damp hair and spray with hairspray when it’s dry.

Okay, I will definitely get layers cut in. My last stylist did not layer my hair much at all. 

I haven’t tried out much so thanks I will test those out!&&&Good to know! I’ll keep that in mind for my next cut"
