Supersox22,d7k4mo,"Your experience with curly products&&&I got Deva curl's wavy texture hair cream and it totally changed the shape of my hair. Where it used to spiral loosely (think very stretched out ringlets), the wavy cream literally made it waves..like more two-dimensional literal waves. I was thinking of trying their products for curly hair instead. Have any of you had experience with it? I was looking at the Believe In, or the volumizer. Both say they ""plump up curls"" but I wonder if it would be too heavy for my hair."
WeAreStarless,d7k4mo,"it sounds like the wavy products already were too heavy for you, so i think the curly products would be even worse. maybe try something other than devacurl?"
lili_sunshines,d7k4mo,I have the same hair. Instead of using the wave maker use the light defining gel. I find with wavy hair you need an even amount of control without it being to heavy the wave maker didn't work for me either.
QueeniJazz,d60f1z,"Yesterday I found out I have wavy hair. My hair have never been all straight, but when I had wet hair I just combed it so it got straighter. I thought that getting curls when showering was normal. Then I tried CG routine just for fun. Do you have any tips for the waves, I’m a noob at this😂&&&&&&Hahaha, for me this is so chocking. I just didn’t think “oh maybe my hair is wavy”, when my hair got curls in the shower. 
It was just a coincidence that I tried, I thought “well this ain’t gonna work”, but yeah My hair stayed wavy😅

Thank you so much for the tips. I’ve always had frizzy hair. I could stay nice for a day maximum, then get dry and frizzy. I’ve tried oils, hair masks. But maybe now I know that I just need to take care of it more and differently.

I’ve tried to blow dry it, it got very frizzy.. but we’ll learn I guess😅 
I will definitely try out your tips.

It’s like a whole new world for me now

Well CG made me discover I don’t have straight hair, and I’ve also learned more about what products to buy. 
Right now I’m just trying out, it’s only been 2 days so we’ll see how this turns out. I have conditioner left in my hair, which I thought would be a disaster- but my hair felt super soft&&&I’m gonna check that out, maybe get some product online and see what my hair will become 😂
Right now the back of my head is frizzy, not super wavy. Front of my head is wavy and soft.. but I will probably learn how to handle it in the future 
Thank you for the diva wave tips! 😊&&&Hahha, that’s so crazy. Was just about to post update pic. I did just the same, comb my hair wet and blow drying it while combing throw. Just thought it was a normal thing.. I guess not😅"
Sarahgrajales,d60f1z,I also always thought that everyone in the world got wavy / curly hair in the shower ! LOL I’d even say gosh I wish that my pretty wavy and even some curls would not go away all wile taking a brush and blow drying my hair straight then adding frizz control spray 🙄 Never once did I think hey I might have wavy hair I honestly thought I had straight frizzy hair ! Nope turns out I have type 2a -2b wavy and a few little ringlets underneath!
lucyeloise,d60f1z,"I was laughing when I read this because I had the same accidental discovery about 6 weeks ago.  I did used to have really straight hair then over the last year found it more difficult to manage...then realised it was wavy when wet. Looking forward to seeing what advice you get so I can try it!

In my trial and error discoveries so far, I comb it before I rinse conditioner out, but then no more combing, just detangle with my fingers.  To dry it I wrap it in a micro fibre towel for 20 mins or so, then scrunch with curl jelly (I tried the Umberto Gianni one this week and I like it because it holds my waves rather than weighs them down - I have fine hair.  Curl cream seems too heavy for my hair). Then I let it air dry.  I haven’t worked out how to blow dry it yet without making it go straight again...

Olaplex once a week and a hair mask once-twice a week seems to be helping the condition, but my hair was quite dry.  It’s such a learning curve! 

Massively struggling to make it look pretty again day 2 after washing.  My most successful thing so far has been to either twist or loosely braid it overnight to reduce frizz, then dampen it again in the morning, and rescrunch with curly jelly.  Definitely an experiment!

How are you finding CG method so far?"
meowthanks,d60f1z,This is my problem too! I have super fine and mildly wavy hair... I just can’t cut the frizz and get nice waves. I’ve been focusing on hydration and it’s helping but it’s still not where I would like it. Waves are difficult!
minochan454,d60f1z,"I had the exact same experience too! I've fallen in love with Diva Wave. If I scrunch it into my hair then let it air dry, I can shake out the product and I have touchable waves.  Then I can touch them up the next couple of days by dampening them and scrunching with a towel.  I've just had to play around :) I have very fine hair and I also live in a very dry climate. My hair looks way more wavy in humidity."
mistergreenside,d60f1z,"I’m in the exact same boat. Savannah, GA does not play around with the humidity and my fine 2a hair is looking like bed head most days at this point :("
prettylady2208,d60f1z,"Same story. I discovered it in July  of this year and started the cgm. It's only been 3 months but I already seeing results. I've been using devacurl products and a very good tip I learned is to not squish the water out before applying the styling products.  The devacurl products like water and will work better that way. 
 I just heard about olaplex and will try it soon, I need it to rebuild my sulfide Bonds !"
thistimeofdarkness,d60f1z,"My exact experience! Good luck. Wavy is hard. I'm not trying to be a downer, I'm just struggling. My hair is really fine and gets suuuuuuper frizzy. I'm in the southern US, so that makes it harder because of humidity. I know they're has to be a way to get it looking good. Or at least decent....&&&Damn... Another product to buy and try.

Jk, thanks!"
