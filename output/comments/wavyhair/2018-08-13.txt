Raluc,97sg3x,"How to get more shine in my wavy hair&&&I have 2b thin and lots of hair. I live in tropical weather. I have been trying to get back my natural curl for the past two years after blow drying and straightening my hair in salons for my whole life.
But, I've been missing that shine I used to get when I blow dry it. Is there an equivalent? A way to get that shine without it looking greasy? 

I haven't found the perfect combination for treating my hair but right now my routine is:
- shea moisture fruit infused coconut water weightless shampoo
- not your mother's beach babe moisturizing conditioner
- ogx quenching + coconut curls curling hair butter

-mizzani true textures curl enhancing lotion
-umberto giannini no more frizz anti-frizz curl serum"
