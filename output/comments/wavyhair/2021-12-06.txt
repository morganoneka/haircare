Honest_Extension_249,rf74af,How do you style your hair?
Vinovedivici,rf74af,"The denman brush is your best friend! I have the D3 one and you can take out rows if you like. After I wash my hair, I comb some mousse in it, then section it and use the Denman brush. There's lots of videos on YT on how to use it, but you can also try some techniques of your own, like twisting the brush. That brush really changed things for me!"
awful_falafels,rf74af,"Mine was always straighter in the front too until I started to follow CGM (for the most part). Luckily, your hair already has those beautiful ringlets shining through in spots so I don't think it will be long for the rest to follow suit.

I will say though that CGM does have some suggestions that may be too heavy for wavy or wurly hair, so experiment with lighter products (mousse, lightweight leave-ins, etc) and gradually work your way to heavier products if you need to"
bigmisssteak7,rf74af,"Any suggestions for bringing out more of my waves?? I have no idea how to care for them + it’s super straight in the front 😭&&&&&&I hope so!! I can definitely notice it’s getting curlier&&&In this picture, I just used Manuka Honey Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner, argan oil, and not your mothers curl cream. If I use gel it always turns out really poofy and tangly, and I don’t notice a difference when I use mousse. I just let it air dry here but haven’t had any luck plopping or using a diffuser. I just don’t know what methods to use :/&&&I also brushed after I got out of the shower (I know it’s better to brush when you have conditioner on it but I forgot)"
sdchibi,rf74af,"It's not always easy to tell from a picture, but I think you've got similar hair to mine (fine hair, lots of it,  easy to flatten waves with heavy product). What helped me, especially after coloring my hair, was to use a leave-in detangling conditioner, a bit of argan oil just on the ends and then plop for about 10-15 minutes so that it's damp (not dry) and then let it down, apply a little bit of curl defining lotion, scrunch and then let it air dry. Sometimes I'll use root clips as it dries if I need the extra volume or if my waves are getting weighed down by the water. The key for me is to not let the hair get weighed down by product and not let the hair be weighed down by the water as it dries or it pulls the wave right out of it."
-germanisette-,rf6mke,"I use the Trader Joe’s tea tree conditioner, and rinse out about 90% of it as per my hair stylist’s instruction. Then I do a gel cast and diffuse until my hair is dry or almost dry. Once the gel cast is completely set, I crunch it out, and then immediately follow up with hair spray. This helps keep all the curls in place, prevents frizz from forming, and also keeps flyaway hair strands out of my face. 

I have fine hair and used to have barely any volume at all, and now my hair has volume for days, literally. If I wear a pineapple bun to sleep, I just need to carefully remove it in the morning and shake my head, and I am good to go for about 4 days. 

The gel cast was a game changer for me. I don’t know where all the gel goes once it is crushed out. My hair is lightweight and fluffy and not at all the way it is when I apply gel “normally” (not as a cast)."
Feeling-Simple-9050,rf6mke,My hair easily ways down too. You could try mixing in a little water before putting the products in your hair to dilute it.
FolkMetalWarrior,rf6mke,"I have a similar fine, wavy hair structure. Kind of a 2A/2B hair with a little bit of 2c in random parts. I have a hard time finding cream based stylers that don't weigh my hair down or leave it looking greasy. 

Recently I started using the Cantu wave whip curling mousse. It's kind of amazing? My hair feels like nothing is in it at all and my curl patterns have been getting much more definition. I'm still experimenting with how much to use but I definitely will throw my recommendation toward Cantu. AND it's less than $6 so, hard to go wrong. https://www.amazon.com/Cantu-Natural-Hair-Curling-Mousse/dp/B0178H2LK4"
HyperbolDee,rf6mke,"Curls Blueberry Bliss leave in conditioner, and NYM Curl Talk Mousse. Both are very lightweight and the mousse give me just enough hold."
KestrelLowing,rf6mke,"I was going to recommend mousse as well - I use NYM's too.

Everything else, including all sorts of gels I tried just make my hair feel really icky.  I don't get perfect hair, but my frizz is greatly reduced and I get more definition as well.  Most importantly, I don't get that weird stringy snake issue and if on my 3rd day hair I want to put it in a braid, brushing it doesn't make me want to cry."
RubyJD,rf6mke,john freida dream curls mousse is the best thing i ever discovered you could try that?
VioletSedanChairx,rf6mke,"I have thinning/low density hair, the individual hairs are a combination of fine to coarse. I use a very lightweight conditioner as a leave-in (OGX Pracaxi Oil conditioner works best for me) right after rinsing out my regular conditioner. I only use about the size of 2 peas. Right out of the shower, hair still dripping wet, I separate my hair in top and bottom sections, and put Aussie Miracle Curls mousse near the roots, to about an inch or so down. I then use a thicker, stronger product for more hold on the rest of the hair (MopTop Curly Hair Custard). 

BUT I'm careful about the amount I use. It's taken some trial and error to figure out the exact right amount to give hold and control, without too much weight. My advice would be that whatever you use, start with the smallest amount possible until you get the look/hold you want without too much weigh down.

I then style with a denman brush, brushing upwards away from the root, then plop very loosely in a an old t-shirt (VERY loosely - wrapping too tightly pastes my hair to my scalp) for about 10 minutes. As I diffuse, I gently ""rough up""/push up the roots with my fingertips. I diffuse only until the cast is set, then air dry. Hopefully this is clear and at least a little helpful!"
bgaudz,rf6mke,"I have thin wavy to curly hair, I have been having trouble finding products that don’t weigh my hair down, I’ve used shea moisture and found it too dense and marc anthony makes my hair too frizzy. I also find many leave in conditioners too much for my hair&&&&&&I live in Canada and we don’t have Trader Joe’s do you know of anything similar?&&&Thank you!!&&&Thank you!!&&&I’ll have to try it!&&&thank you!!&&&In this picture I used Marc Anthony Leave In Conditioner and  Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie and Gel, with my Diffuser. I find my hair to be quite thin, I wore a ball cap and toque for 2 years straight and It’s taken a beating.&&&thank you for the suggestions everyone!!&&&thank you for the suggestion!"
busigirl21,rf6mke,"Things weigh down my curls especially well with my waviness and for whatever reason Kinky Curly curl custard really works well for me. It sets my curls well and it's all very light once I break the cast after diffusing. I also find that a lot of leave in conditioners are hard for me but Eva NYC Mane Magic 10 in 1 has been very nice for me for a leave in. I personally find that I have to rinse conditioner fully out though, my hair just does not like mostly washing out the conditioner to have a little extra leave in, I need to fully cleanse it out."
citylightscocktail,rf6mke,"My hair also needs lightweight products and for styling I use Herbal Essences Set Me Up gel.
I rotate through a couple of conditioners I like, one being Giovanni Deeper Moisture - it’s very hydrating yet rinses out well so as not to leave any weight in my hair. I get it by the liter at Winners (what our TJ Maxx is called, for those of you in the States), which usually has a lot for CGM-friendly hair products."
d057,rf6mke,I use john frieda frizz ease mousse after cheap dep or la looks gel and its great. I have fine wavy hair. I need the gel to really add definition and the mousse adds volume. Try a serum or lightweight gel paired with a mousse and see if that helps! I cant use leave in conditioners. Not a fan of the marc antony products either.
femmilybronte,rf6mke,"I also use nym curl talk mousse if I want a bit more hold. Often I’ll just go with aveda phomollient foam, which has less hold and a bit more movement. I also will sometimes go with aveda cherry almond leave-in and nothing else. It leaves my hair super soft. 

I haven’t tried the blueberry bliss leave-in, but I absolutely love the blueberry bliss reparative treatment. My hair is super protein-sensitive, so that treatment is the only protein in my whole routine. I use it to deep condition about once a week and it leaves my hair very soft and wavy."
gelesenes,rf6mke,When do you generally leave in and mousse? Same time? Or one night one morning?
novakb95,rf6mke,I can relate. I have been using Hands On Veggies and their shampoo and leave-in conditioner are actually quite light
rhoark,rf6mke,What is the gel?
sunsoutbunzout,rf6mke,"I have curl talk mousse and just can’t get into it. How much are you using? Also, at what point in your routine are you using it? I use about 3 golf ball size amounts after combing through my leave in then scrunch it in."
thatbitchbekah,rf6mke,Have you tried Maui Moisture Lightweight Curl line? They also have a foam mousse that I like because gel tends to make me look like a drowned rat?
Low_Upstairs_6715,rf5nge,"Try squish to condish, I apply a bit of leave in conditioner when my hair is still soaking wet after washing it, that helps form the clumps"
SeveralCherries,rf5nge,How do I get my hair to clump up more?&&&Instead of it just blending into each other?
Wavyhaircare,rf5nge,"Are you currently using gel? It's the #1 way for me to get defined waves. Scrunching my hair after the shower also helps some. But gel is the best help, for my hair the harder the hold is, the better."
psychic-carrot,rf3l4z,"Shrinkage&&&So i’ve been doing the WGM for about two months now and some parts of my hair manage to shrink more than others. I know it’s normal for hair  to have different patterns all around, but i was wondering what i could do to encourage shrinkage so that the different parts would match a little bit more. I’ve heard that gel can trap water in the hair and decrease shrinkage, but how can I get a strong hold without it? Anything else that I could do to increase shrinkage?"
New-Significance654,rf04ht,"What products do you guys reccomend for wavy hair?&&&I have johnny b gel but it's mostly the wet look that dries up in a day, any products that keep the natural look all day?&&&Ok, thanks, is it for men?&&& Not sure,  ok sounds interesting.&&&No its wet, then dries up during the day"
North_Potato_7436,rf04ht,Do you know your hair porosity? My hair gets extremely dry throughout the week and I just started using sheamoisture deep treatment with kelp once a week and omg it's a game changer
Vinovedivici,rf04ht,"Milk_shake curl shaper, and the Denman brush has become my best friend lately! It's really helps to keep your groups of hair together so they can form nice waves/curls."
freudianshrimps,rf04ht,I’m absolutely LOOVINGGG the twist products. They’re available at Walmart and they are so incredibly good! The gel is great. It gives great definition but it doesn’t look crunchy at all!
hazardzetforward,rf04ht,"Just curious, when you say the gel dries with a wet look, is it crunchy? If so scrunch it and the crunchiness will go away."
Baleigh25,reyvjl,"Best Wash Day So Far!!&&&&&&Thank you! 🥰&&&Routine:

Shampooed hair, conditioned hair, let conditioner set while I washed body, shaved a bit, etc. combed out hair with conditioner in, squished to condish with head upside down rinsed hair out upside down. 

Added Mousse to hair and scrunched it in then scrunched/micro-plopped with satin pillowcase, then added more mousse to scrunch in, emulsified some gel with water and scrunched that in. 

I’d say the main differences I made were I scrunched my hair a lot longer, added more gel and scrunched to the back where it wants to be stubborn and not hold a wave, and diffused my entire hair, trying my best to focus on everything. 

I think the result is that while my front sections on my right side don’t look quite as wavy as they normally do, the entire head of hair looks more uniform and put together. 

Once I was done diffusing I scrunched out the crunch with some hair oil and fluffed hair a bit. 

Also, if anyone can tell me what my wave type is I’d appreciate it. I always thought it was 2A but I’m starting to think I might have some 2B too 
maybe?"

Expert_Sprinkles_907,rereg4,"Hair feels producty, not sure why. Help please?!&&&I have noticed when I use the NYM Curl Talk Mousse my hair feels producty and I can’t figure out why. 
I have fine 2a hair that is medium density and I think low to normal porosity. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I currently use:
- either NYM blue sea kelp shampoo or Herbal Essences Bio-renew Birch Bark Extract shampoo
- NYM mango Tahitian conditioner or Curl Talk depending if I need moisture or protein 
- Treluxe Reflex Serum
- Aussie Instant Freeze Gel 
I tried the Curl Talk mousse again last night since it had been a while and it still felt producty. Maybe my hair just doesn’t like mousse?  I also clarified thanksgiving week. I only notice it with the Curl Talk mousse. 
Is it possibly just too heavy for my hair? I like the curl enhancing just not the producty feel once it’s dry.-&&&Haha thank you!!  I'll check that one out! \^\_\^&&&Any shampoo or conditioner recommendations? (My hair has been wicked dry lately even with being in the shower for 20 minutes 🤷🏼‍♀️) I’m gonna clarify this weekend and do a deep conditioner but I’m concerned the shampoo and conditioner from this post might be not agreeing with my hair and making it dry when wet 🤔. (PS I follow you on Quinn! 😊 Jen1086!)"
LoopyDev,rereg4,"I have similar hair and find that if I use most gels without using leave in conditioner/curl cream first, it feels like I can never scrunch out the crunch. 

I recently got my hands on the curls blueberry bliss leave in and it worked wonders, helped my hair clump, yet it's very light and doesn't weigh it down."
MsSureFire,rereg4,"In my experience, NYM always made my hair feel sticky and like helmet hair, lol. And the Mousse was the number one culprit of sticky/""product-y"". It's stupidly thick and just...icky, haha.

I prefer Aussie Head Strong Volume Mousse. It super light and isn't sticky in the slightest. Because it isn't crazy thick, it's much easier to distribute it."
Snowstig,rereg4,"My hair HATED the Curl Talk line!  It always felt super producty/sticky no matter what products from that line I used.  I loved Pantene's curl mousse, and Herbal Essences Totally Twisted or Tousle Me Softly mousses were all better for me than NYM."
hazardzetforward,rereg4,I second this. The NYM refreshing foam works well as a light styler. I've found foams/serums to be the best for my fine waves.
pjj165,rereg4,"This happens to my hair with that mousse (and most mousses). I typically use gel for that reason, although I do agree my hair looks better on days I add the mousse. It’s not as bad if you use less of it (you can get any with using less when pairing it with a gel) and I save it for days when I care more about how my hair looks than how it feels"
10MileHike,reoksn,"Keep in mind that the large percentage of products for ""curls"" are very substantive and not really made for thin, wavy hair.   There are a number of prodducts that work well for your hair and curl type, but not the one you are using here."
Csherman92,reoksn,"You are putting things that are too heavy in for your hair. I have high porosity hair, and it sort of looks like yours and I felt that same way. I would recommend like someone else did, MOUSSE. It's light and fluffy.

I have two mousses I really like. I like the Herbal Essences  Totally Twisted Mousse 2, and I like the Tresseme' Flawless Curls mousse. I don't use them together. Nothing holds my hair as good. 

You don't need something with coconut in it because it just sits ON your hair. I had this experience when I used heavy shae products, and coconut anything. The cantu I liked, but it made my hair feel so greasy. Like I had to wash it again. I didn't like that. The cantu just wasn't it for me.

If you want to use their products, might I suggest their curl refresher spray. I havent used this, but it looks like it would do what I would want it to do.

I would only use 1-2 styling products for you, and much thinner conditioner."
DogBreathologist,reoksn,"My hair is the same unfortunately, I just can’t use heavier products like gels and creams and custards, they just flatten my hair and make it greasy and limp. I would stick to the things you mentioned like salt sprays and mousse, though I always find less is more. It can also be really helpful to scrunch your fair and blow dry it with a diffuser or let it dry scrunched while sitting up or in a hair bonnet/towel so it dries in the shape you want it in."
HonestlyRespectful,reoksn,"That custard felt super product-y to me, and I have coarse, medium to low porosity, medium density 2b-3a hair. I didn't like it at all, had to wash it out."
Jeep_mom_tx,reoksn,Jessi curl weighed my hair down bad! I started using Mielle and Dove’s curly hair line and my curls are happy again! 😉
Massive_Suspect_3456,reoksn,"Does curl custard work for thin wavy hair? When I use aunt Jackie’s curl la la custard I just find it makes my hair limp and greasy-looking.

I live in Europe so it's been hard for me to find appropriate products since this sub seems to be mainly people in the US. 

So are you saying you recommend that I change my conditioner AND leave-in conditioner (the cantu product)? Because I see both have coconut :')

I have noticed that if I only use mousse, I don't get as nice definition as when I use it with the cantu cream. But maybe it would be even better with a lighter leave-in conditioner&&&Thank you so much to everyone for all your thoughtful and detailed suggestions! I'm going to try the Giovanni L.A.

NJbeaglemama,reoksn,"I avoid creams and custards on my fine, wavy hair. I like to use mousse, foams, and water-based gels. I like to finish off with sea salt spray for a textured look and let it air dry. Don’t forget to scrunch! 💗"
NicolaMK,reoksn,Cantu weighs my hair down. I use the Umberto Giannini scrunching gel which is a UK company.
alyshasilverstone,reoksn,Sea salt spray!
apolliana,reoksn,Kinky Curly Custard is the only thing I use! It gives me more hold than other gels for some reason. But other custards might be heavier? I definitely can't use curl creams.
bucketofardvarks,reoksn,"Sounds pretty heavy for your hair really, if you aren't liking results try using less watered down, or go for a mousse instead"
cautiouscrafter,reoksn,"I’m too lazy to read through all the comments, so I’m just gonna post this and apologize in advance if someone has already said this! 😂

I have thin waves. I have a lot of hair (it’s collar-bone length), but overall, it’s pretty thin. 

I find that less is more. I usually shampoo with a light, sulfate-free, paraben-free shampoo. I use deep conditioner a lot. 

I use a small amount of leave-in spray, and sometimes some R+co Turntable curl cream (I’ve tried like 20 curl creams and this works best for my hair), or some Cake beauty cream. I love their line.

Then I leave it alone. If I scrunch, it gets so dang frizzy. Sometimes I use my giant diffuser and kind of hover diffuse or put it on top of my hair about 2 inches below my roots, push up toward the roots for volume, and dry it a bit. But the less product I use and the more I leave it alone, the less greasy and frizzy it gets.

Good luck!!!

Edit: typo"
eggoverdose,reoksn,"i LOVE mielle! especially their pomegranate honey line.&&&hi! i just wanted to chime in and say that i have 3a-3b curls. cantu and custards both tend to be too heavy for my hair, so i’m positive those are what weighs your hair down. i’d recommend leave-in conditioner sprays for your waves."
kmkgates,reoksn,I’d suggest using either the Cantu curl activator OR Curl La La but not both together. My hair seems to be similar in length & texture as yours. I’ve had good results applying a dime sized amount of the Cantu or Curl La La to soaking wet hair & then scrunching in gel
musicalmink,reoksn,I prefer their quick curls for my wavy hair. Doesn’t seem to weigh it down as much.
pixiepeanut,reoksn,"Cantu is too heavy, I use thinner gels and they work much better for hold and definition. Wella shockwaves gel is super cheap, mix up with some water and you have amazing hold"
squigglylinesofine,reoksn,"I have the same hair type as you and I actually haven't washed my hair in 3 months. It's made a huge improvement. I just massage my scalp under the water as if I was shampooing and then finish my shower by blasting my hair with cold water. I'll plop and maybe twist my curls if they need it. If I do use product, I use Cult+King hair jelly. I've tried many products and to me, that's the all time best. If I feel like my hair is dry or has build up a 1:4 avc:water rinse does the job. 

There's a product where I live called Jessie Curl and they have an amazing curl refresher spray. All natty and insanely light weight"
w11f1ow3r,reoksn,"I have super thick hair but it is true that some hair types get weighed down by excessive amounts of product. The amount of product used in a typical “curly girl” routine would leave my hair looking limp and greasy. 

It can help when you’re applying your product to water it down in your hand before you put it in your hair. That helps me.

Edit - I also love the Cantu wave whip mousse because it’s a very light mousse."
whit_flinn,reoksn,"I would not suggest using this many products... also the salt spray is very different product from using a leave in, curl cream and I personally don’t use salt products/texture products unless I want completely different results. I would use shampoo/conditioner, no leave in and just mouse. Or maybe leave in and mouse/gel. Forget the salt spray. I’d only use that on days you are going for high volume, because in my experience salt spray dries my hair out, and takes a lot of shine away. I only use salt spray on days I want big volume but not definition really and I don’t think it plays well with other more conditioning products personally. I would try simpler routine, I think you will benefit from it,"

Any recommendations?&&&sweet! Maybe i’ll try the new formula and see how it goes. 

what is your go to conditioner?&&&good to know!"
NotMyAltAccountToday,re9ukf,"My favorite product was reformulated&&&I need suggestions for a new product from ex One 'n Only conditioner users. 

I've used the new version once but don't feel like it worked as well. My hair didn't feel as slippery and was not as wavy.

Along with the conditioner, I use Noodle Head curl cream and a gel (that I can't remember the name of) after that. 

Thank you!"
CaitOfCarrotFlowers,re77a1,"Haircut fix?&&&&&&How much shorter do you think? Shoulder length?&&&ETA-
I got a shag cut in October and my hair has been tantruming ever since. The shorter layers on top are okay.  But the lengths/ends are sad/almost straight and stringy.
Tips on what to ask for at the next hair appt?

I have fine, low density hair and it’s medium-high porosity.

Routine-
Shampoo and condition with Nexxus Protien Infusion.
Glaze and scrunch homemade flax seed gel.
Plop 10-15 minutes.
Diffuse.

Thank you!!"
HistorySquirrel,re77a1,You have exactly the same hair type as me and I had exactly the same problem - top layers look great but lengths get stringy. Only solution I’ve found is to trim the lengths. I only had to remove about an inch for it to have an obvious effect though so if you’re concerned about losing length do it a bit at a time.
WeAreStarless,re77a1,i would recommend getting the lengths cut a lot shorter. right now they're really disconnected from the shorter layers
