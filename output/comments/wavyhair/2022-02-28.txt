Ensabanur81,t8ft1r,Your waves are so pretty!
Euphoric_Watercress,t8ft1r,"FIRST DAY DOING WAVY!?&&&&&&I decided to dive into wavy/curly girl using Not Your Mothers Curly Talk collection. I’m talking shampoo, conditioner, and the gel (which was so scary but omg- gel is the answer here!!!)

I’ve always had pretty wavy hair, the first two were right after the salon, but lately my hair has been feeling so dry and limp and sad. I wanted to start working with my curls so they won’t be limp. 

I highly recommend not your mothers to beginners. I was looking at bougie brands bc I’m attracted to that stuff like Bumble and Bumble, but honestly, the scent of Curly Talk is just as good. 

Thank you guys for helping me take this leap! I thought I’d weigh my hair down bc I have fine hair!! If this is the sign you are looking for, I’ll tell you I’m one day in and so happy!"
No-Collection-6982,t8ft1r,That’s amazing how products make your hair so wavy from the before pic
SoonToBeMamaOfTwo,t8ft1r,"I love that line of NYM for my wavy hair as well, it always does the trick!"
mommafo,t8ft1r,Holy cow!!! That's some full-on ringlets!!&&&Which gel is it? I know they have a hard hold and something else.
03rk,t8f0qg,"Help! Frizzy AF&&&&&&Routine: 
Wash with Shea Moisture curl shampoo, detangle and squish upside down with treseme nourish conditioner, some shea moisture curl defining cream when sopping wet and them garnier curl gel. Let it set, oil on hands and SOTC. Fuzzball immediately.&&&Ooh good to know, will try that!"
Extension_Ant,t8f0qg,"Are you clarifying at all? That’s how mine looks when I’ve got product buildup, which can make the situation a bit frizzy!"
Hellosl,t8f0qg,Someone told me treseme products are very drying. Try a different conditioner and maybe even a leave in conditioner too.
Retiredgiverofboners,t8f0qg,Looks like you have thick coarse hair? Don’t use any products  and just diffuse and see what happens
10MileHike,t89uly,"I think your hair looks really pretty and natural.      


I am not sure more layers will help but be careful because if you have low density or fine hair, more layers make you look like you have less hair ..... something a lot of people don't udnersnad."
Animasylvania,t89uly,"I feel like I'm saying this to everyone, so I'm sorry if I'm wrong... But I think you would benefit from more layers. Especially point cut layers."
HyperbolDee,t89uly,"Try something with a stronger hold? I feel like if your hair starts out fine, you need to figure out the finishing products/techniques that will keep it there. 

It’s taken a lot of trial and error for me, but I like NYM Curl Talk mousse; it gives a lot of hold but is lighter than a gel so it doesn’t weigh me down. In general for waves, less is more, so find like one or two products that are super stars and don’t try to add too much to it. 

You should also experiment with drying techniques too. Air-drying helps me maintain what I have better than plopping or diffusing, but everyone is different. I’d also suggest maybe leaving in more of a cast than you have been. If I can resist the urge to totally scrunch out my hair and leave it a liiiiiittle crunchy, my results last a lot longer."
LongTallSalski,t89uly,Finally someone with hair like mine! Following for suggestions.
No-Collection-6982,t89uly,Go get layered cut and light gel with strong hold
__wastelandbabie__,t89uly,Same hair as you and I spritz my hair with water and use a denman brush loosely and use a tiny bit of mousse and scrunch.
gubletoffiree,t89uly,Same hair as me!
halfbaked625,t89uly,"last wash day.. advice? hair always falls at the end of the day&&&&&&Routine and other info here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Wavyhair/comments/t88xhz/waves_are_dead_straight_the_next_day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
leeproductions,t89uly,Lol same.  I wish I had some answers.
wont_smile,t89uly,"Could not agree more! I have similar hair if you want to look through my post history. My haircut is a shag and the shorter layers sort of blend with the longer ones but still give my waves towards the crown of my head a little volume.  I also suggest if you don’t already to avoid heavy oils or hair creams that could potentially weigh your hair down. I layer a couple light hold, flexible gels then the final layer is a strong hold gel then mousse. This might not be the best routine for your hair so feel free to experiment. This is just what I found to keep my waves intact by the end of the day."
AuroraBlue6,t88xhz,"Sounds like you’re a 2b. 2b is often straight at the crown with waves that get stronger and can curl into ringlets at the ends. 

If your waves are falling, it could be weather, products that aren’t right, product distribution, or a lack of protein."
Lawwife78,t88xhz,"I have wavy hair (that is fine and low-density plus high porosity from straightening & highlights), and I need both hold products (stronger hold gels) and sleep protection (buff + silk pillowcase) if I want anything the next day. I also have to mostly diffuse instead of entirely air dry to get staying power."
PM_ME_heartwarmth,t88xhz,"Do you use hairspray, or play with your hair a lot through out the day? My hair was falling extremely flat when I used hairspray/texture spray even a little bit. And I play with my hair literally every second of the day so I could prob get a lot more days out of one wash if I didn’t. 

I read your routine, do you reapply gel after plopping? It reads like you add gel before plopping. I would suggest reapplying even a little more evenly distributed before diffusing. Maybe even emulsify the second round with water too to work the gel chunks out into something thinner and smoother if that makes you feel more safe doing a second round of gel. You’d be surprised how much product gets lifted off your hair after scrunching to dry/plopping. My best days I actually don’t use the heavier gels I have before plopping, they seem to pull random micro strands of hair out of clumps and I end up more frizzy too. I will use a gel mixed with water in a spray bottle before plopping for best results on my end. Mouse was especially bad with the getting sticky and pulling strands out/messing shape up back in the beginning."
Professional_Ad7110,t88xhz,Saving cause my hair is the exact same way😭
atjetcmk,t88xhz,"The way you type your hair is to wash it and let it air dry naturally without manipulation or products. I'd have to guess you're a 2A based on your pictures. Not that the type matters much, but if you're treating it or expecting it to act like type 3 hair, you will be disappointed. 

My hair is pretty similar. It's 1C and I can use scrunching and gel to make it look 2B. I'll have some waves on the ends the next day, but it's still pretty flat. I have to rewet and fix again if I want it to look curly."
commentator7806,t88xhz,What’s your routine?
ebba_and_flow,t88xhz,You need to use a gel! Or at least a mousse. Waves aren't going to hold unless you make them lol
halfbaked625,t88xhz,"waves are dead straight the next day&&&any advice? My hair is definitely healthy, fine & thin, high porosity. My hair ranges from 2A-2C and 3A at the ends.. I can never get my hair to stay.. even towards the end of the day it straightens out 🥲&&&I have tried a lot of different protein treatments and I feel like I have had zero changes.. Bond salve, aphogee, curls green protein treatment… I am clueless On this part. I will say — I did a deep conditioning treatment with a  brigio product and my hair was a lot wavier out of the shower (with a good amount of frizz) but once I wake up the waves and curls are dead and the frizz subdues&&&Kind of all over the place:

-  I clarify once every 1-2weeks with regular suave shampoo  (usually after an aphogee protein treatment but stopped recently because I saw it did not make a difference in my hair.. didn’t hurt, didn’t help) 
- curlsmith strengthening shampoo (purple line) 2-3 times a week. I do it more often because my hair looks best after any shampooing (more waves & curls!)
- style soaking wet with miss jessie jelly soft curls, microplop to get extra water out & diffuse… I stopped this step because I wasn’t getting any definition or the results I wanted. I found that no products left my hair with more volume, nice waves overall. 
- ^ this worked really well once, but i tried the same routine over and over & it doesnt come out nicely. That’s it!&&&https://www.reddit.com/r/Wavyhair/comments/t89uly/last_wash_day_advice_hair_always_falls_at_the_end/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Photos here!"
superdeeluxe,t88xhz,"I think a few of my points may have been mentioned but I want to reiterate:



Based on your photos provided, you are overtyping your hair. There ain’t anything 3A about it and that’s fine. Curly and coily hair starts at the root.



Your hair has straight roots and some wave. It’s wavy. Wavy hair can still form ringlets or spirals. Whether it’s 2A or 2B doesn’t really matter because there’s no huge, earth shattering difference between the two. Treat your hair like it’s wavy and not curly and you’ll end up in a much better position.



With that being said, your routine doesn’t contain any strong stylers. Miss Jessie’s Pillow Soft Curls is just that, a soft styling product with next to zero hold designed for curly types who don’t need it.



You need a strong holding gel or mousse. I’d then microplop, diffuse, and set with a flexible hold hair spray, SOTC, and see how that works.



It may take some trial and error to find the right styler for you and whether your hair prefers gel over mousse.


I’d also experiment with the amount of water you’re using during styling and refreshing. Wavy hair gets weighed down easily so for some, the less water, the better and damp (vs. wet) styling or dry refreshing is the way to go."
sweetpea1154,t88xhz,"This is my exact same issue too! Even with the use of mousse and gel, my hair always seems to straighten out the next day. It’s super frustrating."
twistedguts800,t88xhz,Mousse and gel. Put mouse at roots and use praying hands methods and then scrunch more your hair. If this does not work then check with the weather and see if your hair could reacting to a change in temperature.
No-Collection-6982,t88we0,Look so good. I hope my hair can get more curly like yours. I’m just started for 1 month from2A to 2 B I hope
PM_ME_heartwarmth,t88we0,"Damn those are some perfect curls. Might pick up the products you mentioned to see if it’ll work well for me. Have you been using these products and the results are faulty sometimes, or did you just try this method and it worked well??

Also, how do you have your hairdresser cut your hair? Is there a certain word usage to get your haircut? Your haircut really plays into the waves (understatement, curls in this pic lol) nicely. I am having a hard time getting the cut down to the art of not triangle shaped hahah. My hairs about as long as yours."
SprinkledDonut88,t88we0,"First good hair day in a while.&&&&&&Thank you. ☺️&&&I've been using those same products throughout my hair journey, which I started 11 months ago. I've tried some other creams and gels, but always end up going back to those two because they work nicely with my hair. If I don't get the results I want, it's usually because I accidentally used too much or too little product that day. Somehow, on this day, I managed to get it just right. 😂 Weather can also factor in how my hair looks. Like if it's windy or humid, as soon as I step outside my hair is pretty much done for. Haha. As for the haircut, I really didn't ask for a particular cut. I just let my stylist do her thing. She put a lot of short layers in the front and sides, I do know that.&&&I've been having a lot of mediocre hair days lately, so I was so happy yesterday when my hair looked really nice for once. I do wish my hair had more volume, but I'm still counting my blessings.

My routine: I shampooed and conditioned with Pacifica Pineapple Curls. After rinsing, I combed my hair with a wide tooth comb and then applied Cantu Curl Activator Cream. Combed through again. Then I flipped my hair upside down and glazed over my hair with Mop Top Curl Custard and then scrunched/squished. Then I plopped for 15 minutes and let my hair air dry."
gesundheitsdings,t88we0,You‘re looking great!
ebba_and_flow,t88mwd,which examples?
old_rose_,t88mwd,"Triangle hair&&&Has anyone gotten an intentional triangle hair cut? My face is really round and cuts with lots of layers/volume around the sides/back just make it look rounder. I have 2B high density high porosity hair. Its mid back length right now but its too high maintenance and the ends get damaged so quickly, I want to cut it.

&#x200B;

Also I am white and my hair is v different texture from both of these examples, but I think the concept is there."
oshayuyu67,t85sqq,Is my hair considered straight or wavy ? I am confused and dunnot know how to take care of my hair ! But I oil my hair three times in a week and I use some shampoo I buy in the supermarket 😅&&&&&&What's porosity?🙃
No-Collection-6982,t85sbj,I have short hair too and I only use satin pillow case
jubjub9876a,t85sbj,"Personally I think *anyone* can benefit from covering and protecting their hair at night. If it's too difficult to cover effectively, use a silk pillowcase at the very least"
rylandarnett,t85sbj,"do you guys think my hair would benefit from overnight covering?&&&&&&routine: head and shoulders acv clarifying shampoo + aussie moisture conditioner, herbal essences biorenew mango aloe gel (scrunch in) and diffuse until 100% dry. i have coarse, thick, high porosity hair. i think typing is a scam meant to create competition and malice between the curly and wavy communities but if i had to guess, 2b-2c. thanks!

also, just for clarification, i mean like a silk or other material bonnet meant to keep my hair from *exploding* overnight. i don't have the time to fully refresh and diffuse it every morning, so i'd like to have it somewhat intact when i wake up to avoid a 1hr routine + drying ritual."
seisen67,t85sbj,"I love my bonnet.  My second day hair is usually better than wash day.

10MileHike,t82ynx,"Cutting you hair at this length looks like a pretty straightforward task.    


Light layering in the ends, maybe a few long face-framing layers in front.     


How many inches are you thinking of taking off?"
Catladyweirdo,t82ynx,When you cut off lengths of hair it changes the volume and behavior of it. It usually makes mine lighter and wavier. You may need to use different products and modify your routine to match your new texture.
LadyAugustina,t82ynx,"I need a hair cut, but last time wasn't really a great success (swipe to see the cut)&&&&&&The cut was before I did the curly girl Method, so yeah not the best care. It was just shorter than expected, I wanted a bit longer than shoulder length but the hairdresser didn't really believe me that I had waves and he was really shocked when my hair suddenly got a bit shorter&&&Probably, first it needs to be cut though. I have high hopes that a cut will make the waves start a bit higher and give me some volume&&&Washes with cocunat smrich shampoo
Squish to condish flora and curl cream conditioner

I think I will go for a shoulder length when the hair is wet&&&There just aren't a lot of curl specialist in my area, so I'll probably just look for a stylist that helps me donate my hair. I don't mind them cutting it wet, as I don't loose a lot of length during the drying process.&&&I can only remember going to a hairdresser three times in my live so not a lot of experience. First two times as a child and the last time in 2019. I did already care for my hair by then but not enough. 
When I went in for the last cut the hairdresser didn't really believe me when I told him that my hair was wavy/curly. He was quite shocked when I lost 2 cm during the drying process. He even told another stylist&&&Thanks, not really. I colour it redder with some henna, so the red tint is not natural."
No-Collection-6982,t82ynx,Love color. Is it your natural color?
Tepetkhet,t82ynx,"Ever since I can remember,  I've had my hair washed and cut wet.  The stylists would then blow dry it straight, then take a curling iron to it to curl it up again.  So much damage. 
After discovering the curly girl method, I've either cut my own hair or had stylists who will dry cut my hair.  Works a lot better for me.  I hope you find a stylist that will keep your hair looking as amazing as it does now."
agrumpypancake,t82ynx,"It looks like the hair was styled differently in the two pics, I think the haircut length looks good on you but the hair itself looked quite dry- more of a styling issue than a problem with the haircut? So if the long hair pic is your hair now, and you maintain the same care routine, I reckon a shorter cut will look good!"
kalifranks7,t82ynx,"Do some thorough research of hairdressers in your area, look at their Instagram accounts and find someone who will take care of your curls and listen and respect your concerns and boundaries. This is essential. I’m a hairdresser with curly hair but always have a hard time getting someone to cut my hair right, so when I find that person I never let them go. It’s in the small details of a curly cut."
phillygeekgirl,t82ynx,"*The stylists would then blow dry it straight, then take a curling iron to it to curl it up again*     
I have always wondered about the thought process behind that. I can't help think what a blazing waste of time that is."

BabytheTardisImpala,t80lrv,"Cowlick short hairs driving me nuts&&&&&&I’ve got a cowlick and these baby hairs/short hairs that always stick out and drive me nuts. I’m hoping someone can either provide a recommendation for smoothing them down or making those hairs stronger so they don’t keep breaking? 
I think I have low porosity 2a-2c. 

Current routine- 
Tresemme nourish shampoo and scrub scalp gently with massage brush
Not your mothers anti-frizz smooth moves conditioner- (just bought this) flip hair upside and finger comb conditioner in before combing with a wide tooth comb, then putting my hair in a bun with a clip while I wash my face and body.
Rinse conditioner out with hair upside down paying special attention to get it off my scalp
While wet, smooth on KCKT detangler and use a wet brush to try to style into clumps. (Still need work on styling so the back of my hair isn’t all wonky)
Section and add in Curlsmiths styling soufflé before plopping.
I should mention that on day 2 or 3, everything is so stringy or tangled that I will brush it when dry to smooth the waves. 
Probably need a haircut, but finding a wavy stylist in my area has been difficult.&&&Yeah, I often style it with a part; though I’ve tried both sides and neither makes these short hairs from sticking out weirdly.&&&Oh I’m a face smoosher as well, though I would never thought it was enough to break those hairs! I’ve tried sleep caps, scarves, and buffs and they all fall of me in the middle of the night. What kind of sleep cap did you make? I think mine would require duck tape 🤔"
kamomil,t80lrv,"I had a lot of short hairs after my baby was born, some of it fell out after my pregnancy. Some weren't growing back that well.

Finally I figured that I must be smooshing my face into the bedding when I sleep, breaking off the new hairs. So I made a sleep cap, and that was enough to protect them so they could grow out a bit better."
madeforthesoul,t80lrv,"Do you style it with a part? 

I style upside down, too, but also flip side to side to scrunch and then eventually right side up. My hair will naturally part where it wants - cowlick and all.

If you’re styling hair in the opposite direction of its pattern, you’ll get those wonky waves and strands."
blckrainbow,t7ztzx,"Not sure if you know, but the shampoo has sulfates in it, and the conditioner has silicones (only saying since you wrote you've been doing the wavy girl method). 

I'd recommend doing a clarifying wash with a 'normal' (non-solid) shampoo and see if that helps.

Oil is not a conditioning agent, but a sealant, if you only apply that to your hair, it will do next to nothing."
hhhhhhhhhhhhhc,t7ztzx,"During summer time, my curls get more defined and in winter it gets less. For me weather matters. My country is super humid during summer and dry in winter."
littlegreenturtle20,t7ztzx,"Getting Less Definition with same routine - help!&&&I've been doing wavy girl since January and I had some promising results from my first day so I've been tweaking my method and it's been slowly improving but for the last 4 wash days I've had terrible results. 

Photos [here](https://imgur.com/a/TAukMZ9) showing my first attempt, my best attempt last and what it looked like after washing it today (and how it has looked in the past few washes)

Routine (based on best attempt):

1. Brush dry hair with tangle teezer
2. Wash hair with Lush Seanik solid shampoo
3. Condition (rake/glaze) with Tresemme Keratin Smooth Conditioner and leave in while I wash my body 
4. Wash out conditioner and brush through again - without brushing here, I don't get clumps
5. Squish to condish with same conditioner
6. Microfibre towel for 2+ hours
7. Wella shockwaves mousse + pixie diffusion in sections until mostly dry
8. Spray generously with superdrug gel spray until it dries

I've done a few slightly different things recently but I tried eliminating those things and it hasn't made a difference. Today I deep conditioned with oil overnight and I definitely need some sort of deep conditioner because my hair has been feeling really dry since starting WGM and I think it's because of the styling products. 

I have low-porosity hair, medium thickness and an oily scalp.&&&I have been doing a modified version, based on what I know about my hair. I've tried sulphate-free shampoo in the past and it doesn't work for my hair/oily scalp. I actually even bought a clarifying shampoo in the past without realising what it was and it didn't do much. 

I was getting good results from the conditioner (and was just using what I had) so figured it was okay. I've tried using the Noughty Wave Hello conditioner the past couple of washes which is wavy friendly but the past 4 washes have still been bad.. 

Oil is absolutely a natural conditioner and a treatment I used to use to deep condition before trying wavy methods.&&&It's still in winter here (and humid) but this comment made me notice that my hair is drying a bit faster recently so the weather must be shifting. This is helpful cause it means I need to focus on getting my products in while my hair is still wet! Thanks!

And I'll definitely consider humidity as a factor as we head into summer!&&&Ah, so would you say squish to condish with a leave in conditioner instead of my normal one?"
useyourname___,t7ztzx,"Maybe try using a leave-in conditioner instead of the conditioner you use in the shower - wash out conditioners typically have cleansing ingredients in them, which could be drying out your hair."

superdeeluxe,t7no0m,"Still just wavy hair. If your hair is straight at the roots, it’s wavy. Curly and coily grows that way directly from the scalp which would put you into those categories.

Wavy hair can form ringlets and spirals and still be wavy. “Curl or wave pattern” doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things because there’s no monumental difference between 2A or 2B hair. Otherwise wavy hair is wavy hair, curly hair is curly, etc. and you should treat your hair accordingly.

Knowing your hair’s density or porosity is more important because it helps you narrow down what products and styling techniques that may work best for you."

Thank you! I’ll pray and give brush styling a try next time I wash my hair&&&Routine: 
1. Shampoo with Lush Shampoo bar (with sulfates) once or twice a week 
2. Condition with Insight (dry hair), let sit, comb, STC
3. Wella Extra Volume (well…)  and sometimes also Insight strong hold gel but I don’t really see a difference when I use it
4. Diffuse until 95 dry cause I always stop too early&&&Yes, not the roots but lengths have highlights and done of them are bleached&&&Maybe once every two months when I once again remember there is such thing as protein…. I probably need to look how it goes doing it once a week🙈"
earlyfair,t7j973,"Are you upside-down styling? Personally I find that gives me strange cowlicks around the roots, which can contribute to a messy look. I'm also wondering if your hair might like brush styling, like denman or behairful techniques. You def don't need a fancy brush to do it, just looking up the general technique on youtube or instagram would give you an idea. I think brush styling tends to use gel as well? Could be wrong. Finger coiling your waves might also be a technique to try, and maybe purposefully forming large clumps in your styling. Both of those techniques tend to take time however, so maybe wait until you have a day off to try it!"
holo0000,t7j973,Do you ever use protein treatments?
superdeeluxe,t7j973,Is your hair color treated? It’s a little difficult to tell from the photos.
Apprehensive-Goose84,t7gfnj,"How so you feel about commenting something along the lines ""love your hair in that pic""? Because I do believe it's a bit different from telling someone how they SHOULD feel, it's just that we sometimes see faults in ourselves that aren't even visible to others..."
Fine_Entertainment20,t7gfnj,"Agree, I wish I had thick hair so I could grow it until my knees. I love so much medieval / fantasy crazy long lengths, but, bad genetic"
HonestlyRespectful,t7gfnj,"You're kind of contradicting yourself.... You say no matter how unmanageable thick hair is, they're lucky to have it. That's OP's point, I think. For some thick haired people, it's still unmanageable for them. Just like you think that your thin hair is unmanageable for you. So telling them they're lucky doesn't make it right or true for them. Everyone has their issues. A lot of people think the grass is greener, but if most people think that, then we're all going through the same shit. Am I making sense? It made sense in my head, sorry if I'm not expressing it correctly. For example, I've seen some people with enough hair for 4 people on their head, and they can't even get it in a ponytail or bun... so to them, they don't feel lucky because they can't manage their hair. Just like people with super thin hair having issues with volume and covering spaces where their scalp shows, makes them feel unlucky because they can't manage their hair. So, if these people are posting about their issues, and someone tells them that they're so lucky, it's really not helpful, and might make it awkward for them because it comes off as jealousy."
kamomil,t7gfnj,"""you should feel lucky"" comments&&&I see these comments on posts, that are like ""that's not a big deal, I'd be happy if I had hair like that""

Can we stop comparing hair situations that are not the same thing? If your hair is not the same texture, chiming in with a sneaky comment that your hair isn't as manageable and they should feel lucky, I don't think that's productive.

All hair comes with its own problems. It's not a competition.

Edit: maybe you are thinking that it sounds like a compliment, but it's really telling someone that their problem doesn't matter as much as yours&&&""I love your hair"" great. ""You should feel... because mine is... "" not great. 

I only ever mention my own hair, if I think OP's is similar in texture, and I offer my own routine.&&&No... I think it's more of the same thing. If someone compliments you on something and then says they wish they had it, it's super awkward."
sapicebee,t7gfnj,"I agree, with one exception: thick vs thin hair. No matter how unmanageable thick hair can be, it's nice to actually be able to do something with it. It definitely beats being young and almost balding.

But yes, it's just rude to downplay someone else's experience when they don't even fit the same criteria."
Comfortable_Tea_2660,t7g8iv,"You're probably not doing anything wrong different curl pattern or hair textures are common.
How long is your hair? If it's long enough to braid while damp that could solve some of the issue if you like big S waves."
FullMetalPunk0v0,t7g8iv,"Wavy hair in front but straight hair in the back?&&&Basically what title says, I’m not sure what i’m doing wrong? Help pls 

I double wash and double condition using Dr.Teal’s Lavender conditioner and  Maui Moisture Hibiscus. Afterwards I use TeaTree Oil leave in conditioner and spread it towards the ends of my hair and I then use TGI catwalk curls rock and scrunch my hair, Finally I use two bobby pins to keep the front part from separating and I leave it to air dry overnight.&&&I just cut my hair to where it’s shoulder length, I tried asking for layers but I don’t think they did it right 😭. I have a feeling that since they cut more in the front and less in the back then that’s why I have different curl patterns but I’m not sure."
aliensrock,t7g8iv,Omg my hair is like that too girl i dont even know … i get mad waves on top and the bottom is like barely anything
