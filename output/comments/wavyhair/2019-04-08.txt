tiddle49,bcisj3,"Note to self: don’t add more gel to what already has dried=Frizz + confusion&&&Redhead now second day. Washed with Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil. Applied a large flop of Garnier Fructis 1 minute Mask the one with banana (smells so good.) lLeft on for about 15 minutes, washed out then applied a quarter-sized amount of mask and worked in ends. I then applied a quarter-sized amount of Mizani True Textures and squished then plopped for 10. I tried to keep the clumps but had to do a little rearranging of my hair. Then used Herbal Essences Spray Gel and scrunched. Let it dry still kinda wet in back. Scrunched out the crunch with nothing ( debating whether or not to use got2b glossy anti-Frizz serum but didn’t) Here’s my mistake - I sprayed some gel in my hand and applied to front pieces. This caused my hair confusion and it lost its shape and got frizzy. [Red Waves](https://pin.it/yrjyecl6aqaa77)"
