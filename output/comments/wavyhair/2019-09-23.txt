TifJD,da7lfx,"1. Get silicones and sulfates out of your routine. 2. Don't heat style. 

Beyond that, it will take some experimenting to figure out what works for you!"
charlottewills,da7lfx,Over the last few months discovered my hair is wavy after believing it was straight my whole life&&&I grew up thinly my hair was straight.. in younger photos straight/a very slight wave. Now it’s wavy. I wash it and brush it wet. Then flip upside down and scrunch a very teeny amount of conditioner in. But I don’t know how to deal with it. A possible 2B wave but I am new to this wavy hair thing and CG. Any help would be amazing!
