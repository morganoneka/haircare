StaceyMonison,hq58bw,Plopping is definetly a game changer and your will probably get more defined and waves tighter the more you do it. You might also have curls! At first I thought I had strictly waves but about 6 months in I started getting curls.
TuttiFrutti80,hq58bw,"When trying a new routine try it a few times and only change one thing as you wont know what has helped...if that makes sense. Styling upside down is supposed to help lift the roots. Apply products to soaking wet hair...the wetter the better.....i wasn’t a believer of this...but it really did help.....i dont get too hooked on what type of curl I have and frizz will always be your companion so just accept it!  Gel is usually good for a cast....i always mix with a little water ...to stop it feeling heavy, to add even more mositure...and to make it ‘go further!’ I’m 6mths in and i’m only now beginning to experiment with different products and routines. 
Its a marathon not a sprint....I occasionally straighten my hair and never have any issues with curls when i next wash it - i use a heat spray to protect as hair is silcone free and someone told me you have to be careful. 
Enjoy your waves even they aren’t perfect."
abigale237,hq58bw,"Advice to a wavy hair care beginner?&&&Hi! I had curly hair when I was little but I haven’t  taken care of it as I’ve gotten older. I only shampooed and conditioned. Before last week, I had long hair with very subtle waves(2a). I recently got a hair cut (medium/short length) and my hair has gotten a lot wavier (close to type 2b). I want to take care of it more and I bought a few products but I’m scared my hair will stay the same. I got moisturizing curl activator cream and curl mousse. After my shower today, I sectioned off,  applied both products, and scrunched my hair. It’s wavier than usual but it’s still pretty flat. Does anyone have any advice? How can I better scrunch my hair? With time and care will my hair get wavier? Please answer any advice! I’m new to this and I really want to get better. Thank you!!&&&Thank you for the information!! I’ll be trying different products to see what my hair does best with. I really appreciate your help <3&&&Thank you so much!! I applied my product to soaking wet hair today and my waves looked so much nicer! Thank you for your advice <3&&&Oh my gosh thank you!! This makes me feel a lot better hahaha. I only bought two products and I was thinking about getting more! Out of curiosity, what products do you use?&&&Thank you!!! I will definitely try plopping:)"
heatheradair,hq58bw,"Here’s my experience! 

You’ll get lots of advice thrown at you, lots of product recommendations (you’ll probably end up with a tackle box full of products, most of which don’t quite work), and end of the day; Less is More. 

All of the lingo: “squish to condish,” “praying hands,” “plopping,” etc are all.....a lot to absorb. And! A lot to keep up with. 

As someone who went full “curly method” for a year and obsessed over the products, the steps, the pillowcases and bonnets and diffusers and then abandoned it all, I’ll tell ya.....it can become an obsession. 

Find one or two products that you like. Find a routine that’s quick and easy and gets “generally good results,” and assume there will be good and bad hair days and what works for any of us is different. 

It’s easier to stick with something simple. 

It’s easier to stick with something speedy. 

It’s easier to stick with something affordable. 

One to two products, wash as often as your hair likes, and if you wanna use silicones, sulfates, dye or heat: do it! Do what makes ya feel good. 

And, yep; with time your wave/curl pattern will emerge and sort of....tell you what it wants!"
morgainz,hq58bw,"Your hair will develop a 'memory' of its texture over time. 

But try lots of techniques!! The general goal imo is clean and moisturize your hair, then add something with hold, then style and dry. There are loads of different ways of doing all that, and I think especially wavy hair techniques can look totally different depending on your hair. (ie. Using a clarifying shampoo vs cowash, mousse vs gel, applying stylers on wet vs damp hair, etc)

Hair porosity is a significant part of that - if your hair hasn't been coloured and doesn't have much heat damage, chances are that your hair is lower porosity. Lower porosity hair experiences build up way easier (so keeping it clean is more important), and takes a long time to dry (so helping it dry more quickly is important). 

Personally, I need to use a shampoo (not a low poo) every time I wash my hair (every 2 days ish), and I prefer to style on damp hair to make my hair dry faster, and I prefer smaller clumps. That said, I prefer the look that gels give me versus mousse. I also diffuse my hair as dry as I can get it (and then air dry until it's completely dry)."
Sinky16,hq0g0k,What products do you use? Your hair looks great!
mattberninja,hq0g0k,"i love your hair! not to be creepy, but i looked through your other posts and my curl type is super similar. i have problems getting it to be consistently wavy even if i do the same thing, sometimes there’ll be actual curls but other times it just looks like shitty straight hair lol. i’m thinking about adding some protein to my routine, but i’m not sure what products would work best for wavy hair. do you have any recommendations?"
mimisdailydose,hq0g0k,You’re so right! I’ve never heard anyone in the curly/wavy hair community talk about hairspray! Might have to check that out:)
professionalhippo1,hq0g0k,"I don’t hear many people talk about using hair spray but it saved my wash day today! Left is curl cream only, middle is after rewetting with a spray bottle and scrunching in a soft gel, right is after fluffing upside down and adding hair spray&&&&&&There aren’t many air sprays that don’t have drying alcohol in them so I guess that is probably why. But this aquavescent by jessicurl and it is cgm friendly if that matters to you 😊&&&Thank you! Today was a clarifying day so I used ion hard water shampoo and followed that with a 2 minute avocado oil and grape seed oil hair mask from LIDL. I raked in curl power curl cream from SGX NYC with some jessicurl rockin ringlets that I diluted with water in a spray bottle. That was the pic on the left. I wasn’t happy with it so I rewet my hair (used a full 8 oz spray bottle) and scrunched in Miss Jessie’s jelly soft curls (pic in the middle). Still wasn’t happy so I fluffed my hair upside down and sprayed with aquavescent by jessicurl (right)

I’m only 3 months in to knowing I have wavy hair I’m still playing around with products but my favorite shampoo, conditioner, curl enhancer and gel are from jessicurl. None of their products contain protein so if I need it I add it myself using neutral protein filler.&&&Thank you! 

So when I started adding protein to my routine, I bought a bottle of neutral protein filler and added it to the protein-free products I already owned. I added 3 drops per teaspoon of rinse out conditioner and to my gel (I used an actual teaspoon to measure the product out and I used an old medicine dropper to get drops of the NPF, trying to get drops out of the bottle is really hard). You can add NPF to any product you want - just make sure you do it on your hand and not in the whole bottle.

I have started to buy products that have some protein in them and I really like eco styler avocado oil gel and Miss Jessie’s jelly soft curls. 

Some other things you didn’t ask for but since we have similar hair and these things matter for me lol: 

Do you have hard water? I do so I use ion hard water shampoo to chelate every couple of weeks. It’s cgm approved if that matters to you.

How often do you clarify? I am just beginning to understand how easy it is to weigh my hair down. If I have several bad wash days in a row, or if I can’t get 2nd day hair I clarify. I highly recommend kinky curly come clean. I alternate that with the ion hard water shampoo. KKCC is more gentle than the ion shampoo (both have olefin sulphonate as a cleanser but KKCC has it lower in the ingredients list). I am planing to test out using it weekly to see how my hair likes it to see if I can avoid having the long stretches of bad wash days. 

How much moisture are you using in your routine? I figured out I was seriously over moisturizing and I cut way back. I now avoid products that use heavy butters and oils. I also don’t use leave in conditioners any more. I never used to get a gel cast,  I could never air dry and I had to use super hard hold gels. After backing off the moisture I can use soft hold gels, I can get a gel cast and I can even air dry! 

How much hair do you have? I think part of my struggles come from uneven application because I have a lot of hair. I have found that applying more product than I actually need and adding water to distribute the product works best for me. Once my hair is clean and detangled I give my hair a final rinse. I turn off the water without touching my hair so it’s still dripping. I rake through my curl enhancer. Then I rake my curl cream. Once both are on I squish/scrunch. Then I add a little more water and squish/scrunch some more. By now my waves have formed so no more raking. I scrunch in too much gel and then scrunch with more water to distribute until my clumps are all coated. Then I micro-plop and get as much water out as I can. I use flannel baby blankets to do that. Then I hover diffuse upside down to get things set and then I can either air dry the rest of the way or continue diffusing. 

My favorite products are from jessicurl. I get great wash days using gentle lather shampoo, aloeba daily conditioner, rockin ringlets and spiralicious gel. I also love their deep conditioner but I only use it after clarifying. I only order from them on the 15th of the month when shipping is free.

My favorite non-jessicurl products that I haven’t already mentioned are the creme of nature plex breakage defense bond mender pretreatment,  an avocado oil and grape seed oil hair mask from LIDL (it’s a grocery store very similar to Aldi) Giovanni ECO chic line of shampoos and conditioners, kinky curly knot today conditioner and curling custard, uncle funky’s daughter curly magic, SGX NYC curl power nourishing curl cream, Aussie instant freeze, eco styler avocado oil gel, Miss Jessie’s jelly soft curls."
SecretaryCarrie,hpne9b,Where do I find a list of wave types?&&&I see a lot of people referring to their hair as like 2A or B. Is there a list with explanations somewhere so I could try and figure out mine? I’m on my phone so I apologize if it’s somewhere I just can’t see on mobile.
dianacakes,hpne9b,"[A chart with pictures of people ](https://www.perfectlocks.com/blogs/all-tressed-up/135667655-hair-types-finding-your-texture) 

[A basic chart](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.glamour.com/story/curly-hair-curl-type-chart/amp) 

Honestly, the ""type"" of wave you have isn't as important as the porosity and density though. Your hair type can look different whether your hair is ""naked"" with no products or using products like gel and/or mousse. But how tour hair will react to those products is based on the porosity and density. The only thing I've found helpful about knowing my hair type is that I've found other people with a similar texture to get ideas from. As an example, my favorite leave-in conditioner is Curls Blueberry Bliss which is made by and for Black women (I'm white with barely wavy hair), but it has the perfect balance of protein and moisture for my hair (and a lot of other wavies). If I went strictly by hair texture, I wouldn't have considered it. 

[Here is a quiz to help you determine your hair's porosity ](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)"
WeAreStarless,hpieou,"it's not so much that dry brushing ruins your curl pattern (although it does, but only until your next washday, so that doesn't matter), but that unless you're being extremely gentle, it can cause damage and breakage"
anfleming,hpieou,"Agreed! Brush before shower, finger comb in shower!"
bookraven4,hpieou,"Is dry brushing bad for curl patterns or do people just detangle in the shower because it’s easier?&&&I’m wondering if I’m losing more hair by brushing in the shower but I don’t want to mess up my curl pattern by dry brushing. Dry brushing also takes me half the time to detangle than in the shower.

P.S. finger detangling or using a wide tooth comb don’t work for me, I have to use a tangle teezer for wet hair"
cephalophile32,hpieou,"I always set angle before I shower with a wet n dry brush. Very little damage with that, starting at the roots. Then I’m able to use a wide tooth comb in the shower to comb out the tangles from cowashing/lowpooing. Secret weapon is a vinegar wash though. Life = changed."
dianacakes,hpieou,I stopped dry brushing for a while because I was worried it would mess up my wave pattern. Wet brushing products in was an absolute game changer though because it helped evenly distribute the products and drastically improved my waves. I'm starting to reconsider dry brushing though. Today was only my day 2 but looked horrendous when I took it out of the pineapple. I decided to give myself a trim (because it's been 10 weeks since I've had one and because quarantine) so I dry brushed it first and my hair looked great! It literally went from a hot mess to Victoria Secret model waves just from brushing. So I won't automatically discount dry brushing in the future.
nobody38,hpieou,"I started dry brushing after a friend’s recommendation. I find that it reduces the amount of hair I loose by a lot. When I forget and detangle in the shower, I loose about a hand full of hair, while with dry brushing, I loose about a third of that. Wet hair is also fragile, so maybe give it a go and see if it works for you?"
professionalhippo1,hpieou,I had no idea I even had wavy hair until I was 32 because of in part because dry brushing. Some people’s curl pattern can handle dry brushing but mine cannot. I only ever finger detangle now. It was an adjustment at first but changing the products I use and how I wash and style makes my hair a lot less tangly than it was in the beginning.
zeplantkween,hpieou,"I always dry brush right before I take a shower! Makes it a lot easier to detangle while in the shower, less hair loss, and I feel like it product gets better distributed"
Turbulent_Cricket683,hpgghd,"Hi! I was using the banana hair food but switched to the papaya one as its more moisturising and feels lighter whilst still taming frizz! 
Have you tried applying the mousse to soaking wet hair? I tend to find I get better definition doing that and as you already have a strong curl pattern it might help make your waves more uniform. :)"
dianacakes,hpgghd,"I agree with the other commenter. Co-washing all the time can lead to build up. I don't have any experience with the eco gel, but I know there are several types. Maybe your hair didn't like a particular ingredient in the one you tried? Which hair food (I think there are several)? You have a really strong pattern. Are you doing ""squish to condish"" (where you scrunch the conditioner in you hair to encourage the wave/curl)? I've seen a lot of UK curlies/wavies on instagram using the Noughty brand of products."
mandrew_x,hpgghd,"Help me I'm an amateur! Started looking in to CGM at the beginning of lockdown. I've had slight improvement but I think CGM is too much for my waves. Any help would be much appreciated&&&&&&Any suggestions for shampoos? I use the matching Alberto Balsam one when I think about it but maybe I need something new&&&I use the banana hair food, coconut one was nice but not for me. Yeah I squish to condish after brushing it through. I tend to shampoo when I think about it, just with the Alberto Balsam shampoo, but maybe I need to try a new one. Thanks for you help&&&Sorry for the format, I'm on my phone. I'm in the UK.

This was : 1) Co wash with Alberto Balsam conditioner
2)rinse and apply garnier hair food, leave in while I shower then brush through with a denman brush.
3) rinse out at end of shower then plop with microfibre towel 5mins
4)plop excess water then apply schwarzkopf got2b twisted mousse 
5) put back in microfibre towel for an hour then airdry before bed 

I've worked out my hair does not like gel (have used the ecostyler gel) and doesn't like being styled upside down as the back just matts together.&&&I actually purchased some Noughty Curl creme and spray as the brand was recommended. Tried it for the first time last night, diffused it to about 80% then wrapped it in a tshirt for bed. It's much better today! Need to try doing it earlier and letting it completely air dry next and see if that helps some more. Will get the papaya to try to!"
rousekr12,hpgghd,Perhaps try low poo instead of co wash and add in a weekly clarifying shampoo. My hair is weighed down by co washing.&&&I just found the most amazing shampoo and conditioner for my fine waves. Kristin Ess fragrance free
Kornelija_,hpep6y,"Try to cut out shampoos and conditioners with sulfates, silicones, and harsh alcohols! 

The palmers olive oil shampoo is a good one. Using products like this should give your hair more body and it’s own shine, it will also better the health of your hair"
bleacchy,hpep6y,Can someone help me with my routine? More in comments&&&&&&I shampoo every two days with john frieda (green bottle) and use john frieda conditoner every other day. After i shower i put it in leave in conditioner just a little bit and scrunch grip it with my hands. it just feels flat and i really could use advice.
gatorbytes333,hpep6y,"Maybe try using less leave-in or a lighter conditioner if it feels weighed down? Also maybe try a shampoo with less lather, and use the normal shampoo occasionally to get rid of build up. If you dont mind it looking kinda frizzy, u can ruffle if with your hands when dry near the root to just perk it up.
For the record tho I think your hair looks good as is, doesn’t look that flat from this angle"
TuttiFrutti80,hpcoxu,So the soaking hair application helped! Looks great!

2. s2c (same conditioner) 
3. Aussie instant freeze gel raked through soaking hair and scrunched

Rouanne,hp8nxk,"First day of CGM. Can anyone help diagnose why I can't get curls or waves all over?&&&So I did a reset wash yesterday and used Giovanni 50:50 shampoo followed by Moogoo conditioner and Giovanni LA hold (lightly emulsified). 

I lightly plopped with a t shirt but not sure my hair is long enough for it to work. Then I let air dry, and then crunched. I think I got a cast as it definitely felt crunchy. 

One side of my head feels and looks curlier than the other. Any suggestions on how to get curls all over?

Here's some images: [Day 1](http:// https://imgur.com/a/krxAFoB)

Thank you!"
Woodsy_Walker,hp8nxk,"I have wavy hair too and had to do the CGM method for a couple of months before my hair got properly moisturized and started waving/curling nicely. There were weird straight areas everywhere. It might just be a matter of time. Also, I found diffusing helped a ton! I get much tighter and more defined curls than air drying."
trish3trish,hp8nxk,Some hair types will get more consistent wave as they grow out a bit longer. Mine was much less wavy when I cut it short above my shoulders.
WeAreStarless,hp3wu3,"cutting your hair doesn't change the hair that grows out of your head afterwards. it just might take some time and patience to get back to that, though!"
thatsrightimmagamer,hp3wu3,"Question cuz bit concerned&&&So I got a hair cut like weeks ago and I had wavy/curly hair  (I'm a boy btw) so then my shitty barber straightened my hair to death and cut it so fucking short, I loved my wavy/curly hair. Will it grow back to how it was? I hope so cuz If not fuck that barber that fucked my hair up"
dianacakes,hp3mvc,"Diffusing on the curly girl method is OK as long as you don't use high heat. I know someone else already asked if you're doing the CGM.. If so, one of the tenants is upside down everything - washing, conditioning and styling. You don't HAVE to, but many do. I always diffuse the hair at the crown of my head separately (upside down) to ensure it gets good definition. If you're doing it all right side up, I would just say make sure the back gets the right amount of product and scruching attention as the front."
gatorbytes333,hp3mvc,"Instead of towel drying, maybe just squeeze the water out a few times as it runs down in the air drying process, maybe use a conditioner with some protein. My hairs a bit curlier except in the back where it lies pretty flat, i find that using a jelly or the aussie miracle curl oil when wet helps the pieces clump and look wavier. Also trying not to sleep with the back hair being smushed down"

- no conditioner
- towel dry with standard towel and scrunch it some
- add a standard liquid mousse and scrunch some more

I’ll definitely start to try some of those things.&&&I’ll have to give that I try.  I don’t start in the back with my styling, but maybe doing that will get the product more into that section.

I'm interested in trying new products, especially new shampoo and conditioner. Also interested in new routine suggestions. I have low-porosity, high-density thick hair."

CosmicHaze_,hosawv,"3 month progression😳Routine/tips that helped me in the comments&&&&&&I’m convinced I walked around over moisturized for many years. This is going to be a long one. please let me know if anything isn’t clear and I’m happy to reply. 

Routine: I wash my hair with NYM curl talk shampoo and use the curl talk conditioner every 3 days. I clarify every 8-10 days with suave clarifying shampoo followed up with curl talk conditioner. I apply my conditioner upside down and raking it through with my fingers. I always add more conditioner before I squish it into my hair and let it sit while I finish up in the shower. I also squish the conditioner into my hair while rinsing it out. 

I use a 100% cotton shirt to very gently blot water out of my hair. I do not “scrunch” with gripped fingers. I use a flat hand with my fingers spread and push up from the ends all the way to my scalp. At this point, I use either Aunt Jackie’s or NYM Curl talk gel. While upside down, I very gently rope the product into my hair sections. It’s hard to describe, but think of it like prayer hands but with your fingers instead and smaller sections. I flip right side up and apply more gel and start to flat hand scrunch until my waves look somewhat uniform. Usually I hover diffuse to form the cast because I don’t have 90 hours to let my hair dry. I’m also a fan of sleeping in a cast and flat hand scrunching out in the morning. 

-My top tip for fine wavy hair is to stay away from heavy creams or butters. If you do use them, be careful not to use too much and always add some water during the emulsification process. 

-Gel is your friend, seriously. Always emulsify before applying to your hair to avoid flakes/buildup. 

-Try scrunching without gripping your fingers! This significantly changed the amount of halo frizz I was having. 

-Silk pillowcases and hair ties are your friend. 

-refreshing with only water seems to work very well for my waves because it reactivates product from the day before. I do not spray or saturate my hair. Instead, I wet my hands and do prayer hands method and then flat hand scrunch.&&&Thank you so much! 

I agree about the NYM gel not being strong enough. I rotate with aunt Jackie’s gel, but it’s pricy. I’m going to give the instant freeze a try since I keep hearing about it and it’s reasonably priced.&&&Thank you :)&&&It really depends on your hair type. What works for mine may not work for yours.

My hair is fine and easily weighed down. I steer clear of anything super heavy like butters, coconut, and most cream products."
bleacchy,hosawv,can you suggest me products that dont over moisturize my hair?
dianacakes,hosawv,"WOW! That shine is amazing! I also love the NYM Curl Talk line. I use the shampoo, conditioner, curl defining cream and the mousse. But for gel, I found the Curl Talk not a strong enough hold, so I use Aussie Instant Freeze. I also get the over-moisturized thing! I've skipped conditioner all together on wash days and just did a little bit of leave-in on the ends that are more damaged. I'm still trying to find the right balance."
frqntfly3r,hosawv,Can you elaborate on why you felt you were over moisturized? I'm a wavie and I \*feel\* like I may be over moisturizing but I'm not sure if it's just the transition period where my hair always looks like shit or if it's something that I need to fix with a change in routine.

arivs09,hompyz,"Natural beachy waves! Success!&&&&&&I’ve been following the curly girl method for 3 weeks now. This is the first day the back of my hair has looked even remotely presentable! I’ve been using the same low-poo (I live in a hard water area and low-poo to cleanse my hair every 2 days), squish 2 condish, gel, air dry routine the whole time. I changed two things today: 

1. I didn’t plop in a t-shirt at all (previously I was doing 15 min after styling). I just micro plopped and air dried.
2. I used a lighter gel, which left my hair a lot more touchably soft, even before scrunching out the crunch.

I find I need it about every other day because our water is really hard), Faith in Nature Jojoba conditioner, and Umberto Giannini Curl Jelly gel!

TuttiFrutti80,hoiea4," Don’t get hooked on what curl type you are, I’ve been doing cgm for about 6mths and I have no idea and don’t care, what I focus on is finding routines, techniques and products that work for me. Start simple and don’t be tempted to keep changing things other wise you won’t know what’s working and what’s not, I try something for several goes before I try/change one thing. Good luck and remember it’s a marathon not a sprint!"
aveggiedelight,hoiea4,Currently 2b but you have potential to change once the damage has been treated
minniemooboo,hoiea4,"Your hair looks similar to mine 2a/2b with a few perfect ringlets around my face. I started curly girl this week and my main focus/obsession is to nurse my hair back to health and to get it hydrated. I think my hair is protein sensitive or protein overloaded and I’m guessing it’s fine hair. I’m so confused about porosity as my hair behaves both high and low. 
What’s your routine?"
opaul11,hoiea4,"2a to 2b, definitely in the wavy area"
AllieMitch98,hof24x,"Try Eufora Curl’ line...I’m still new to it, so my hair isn’t exactly how I want it, but I still like it. It’s super concentrated (no water in the formula), so you can make one bottle last forever. You will need the styling products, too. Also, I’ve gone up to 5 days without having to wash my hair."
Leilachu,hof24x,Product recommendations&&&I want to be more comfortable with my hair so any product recommendations. also don't be afraid to post pricier things my mom's can probably get those for half off due to being a hair dresser. My hair is frizzy.&&&I see
WeAreStarless,hof24x,"try styling product like a mousse or a gel! in my personal opinion, it doesn't really matter which shampoo and conditioner you use; what matters instead is your styling products and what techniques you use to apply them"
gatorbytes333,hof24x,"The sgx nyc curl power curl cream might be good for your hair, its a bit on the thicker side for my hair which is kind of medium-thin but might work for yours,"
EoinSalt,hoarwn,Please someone suggest me a cut !!&&&
