Aazathoth,qu73ju,"Lose the wave after bleaching?&&&Hey guys! 

I dyed my hair today and was thinking about how it used to be pretty wavy as a kid but it is straight with the tiniest bit of wave here and there now.

For almost 10 years I have been bleaching my hair and dying it with semi permanent colors (pink/blue/green etc..) 

Other than getting a little greasy, its fairly healthy and thick since the dyes that I use are not harsh.I don't use any special shampoo/conditioner though...

I just bought wavy Function of beauty to try to care for my hair a bit more and maybe get some wave back. 

Anyone else have a similar story? I would assume years of bleaching will have some effects and wonder if I can get any wave back.&&&I'll look into that thank you!&&&I definitely don't plan on stopping dyeing it. Just wondering if anyone could get any wave back after heavy processing. If not, I'd rather have the color and straight hair I suppose haha"
Emarieexd,qu73ju,Try products with protein! Protein is a friend to high porosity hair. Curlsmith strength line is really good.
Spoppy51369,qu73ju,"Bleaching (or I think coloring in general tbh) can make your hair have a higher porosity level, so your hair will take in moisture really well, but won't actually keep most of it. Hydrating products will be your best friend, and if it can handle it, an oil can help lock the moisture in"
Theemperortodspengo,qu73ju,"Bleaching can absolutely affect the texture and curl pattern of your hair. You may be able to get some back with proper care, but it might also not be with the effort if you want to keep coloring it. I only embraced my natural texture after my color grew out"
Curlscatsncoffee,qu5v9y,Which gel do you like best? Also be careful of ogx brand. The oil might be fine but there’s a class action lawsuit against them right now for their products causing hair loss.
Infinite-Homework918,qu5v9y,It’s been quite the journey&&&
choklitmilk,qu5v9y,"I've used OGX even after I heard about the lawsuit and it didn't do anything negative to me, was an alright shampoo and conditioner just made my head itch a little (most likely just react weird because aussie does that too). I had zero hair loss, just the normal amount coming out in the shower because I have thick hair. Is it actually doing that to people?"
_un1ty,qu214t,"Yup this is my hairtype as well! Low porosity but very coarse curly underneath but barely wavy on top. 

Judging from your type and what you mentioned your hair probably does need a lotttt more moisture. Try doing deep conditioning weekly and experiment with sulfate free shampoos if you find them drying. A leave in conditioner does help with the hydration+the tangles. For frizz maybe try a lightweight gel or mousse ? I havent found something that completely gets rid of mine but protecting my hair while I sleep and not using glycerin in leave ins has helped a lot. A leave in I can recommend is the giovanni weightless leave in, overall their whole smooth as silk line is great (shampoo+conditioner) and I really like their 2chicc ultra moist conditioner as well!"
periodbloodpizza,qu214t,"Product/routine recommendations? 2b/2a hair, low porosity, very thick&&&Haircare advice?? 

I’ll be honest, I know very little about what to do with my hair and was looking for advice so I can start properly caring for it.  I currently just wash my hair every other day with shampoo and conditioner but it’s not working out for me. It remains frizzy and tangles a lot!! I know i’m not getting my natural pattern with this crappy routine but I have no idea where to start to formulate a good, working routine. Also, thought I should mention my curl pattern changes from kinda wavy to extremely curly underneath, and I didn’t know if evening this out could be beneficial. So uh please leave recommendations or advice for me, thank you! :]&&&Thank you so much!!! yeah basic advice is needed LOL"
yrusernamessohard,qu214t,"Frizz plus tangles means your hair needs moisture. I personally get along with the Garnier Ultimate Blends hair food aloe Vera 3 in 1 really well. It can be used as a conditioner, hair mask or leave in. I use it as all 3 😂 it just works so well for my low porosity hair! As far as products go for styling I would recommend the kinky curly curling custard. It's a stand alone product which works wonders all you need to do is glaze it over wet hair and then scrunch it in

Most basic advice, use hair masks once a week and make sure to condition well :)"
10MileHike,qtxig2,"I don't think rules are written in stone.    I have super low density hair that loves and requires lots and lots of the (correct) proteins in both my conditioner and cleanser.  


It's fine and low density so it needs the protein because my curls are ""fragile"".  W/out protein I don't get the beautiful curl that my low porosity hair demands."
Pitiful-Agency,qtxig2,"Fine-hair low porosity wavies, do you change your routine significantly in winter?&&&It’s not that cold yet in Philadelphia and my hair is already looking bad. I recently had a curly cut. My hair is above shoulder length and stylist said it’s in good shape. It just feels dry to me already, plus it is never its curliest in winter anyway. My hair is easily weighed down and over moisturized, so leave-ins, curl creams and masks have not worked for me. Just not sure what winter requires of my hair. I avoid glycerin in general bc dew points are all over the place here.
Usual routine: wash with Giovanni volume shampoo (orange tube), condition w Kristin Ess FF or Blueberry Bliss leave-in (which I rinse out). Style w Innersense I Create Volume, then I Create Hold gel or LA Looks Sport. Diffuse until bored or 80% dry. Clarify w Suave and deep condition as needed - maybe every 2 weeks for both. My hair is easily weighed down and over moisturized, so co-washing, leave-ins, curl creams, and masks have not worked for me.&&&LA Looks and Innersense are the only 2 no-glycerin gels that work for me. (Extreme ends of price range too.) LA Looks takes so long to dry but gives me best multi-day results. I’ve tried a ton of gels too.&&&Update: I used my high protein deep conditioner from Curl Junkie yesterday and used a bit more gel when styling. Got great results! Of course the air was more humid too. So many variables. 
I realize the protein thing may be unusual with low porosity hair, but it’s really what I have. Takes forever to wet it and forever to dry once wet. But my hair is healthy (no dye and only low heat diffusing 1-2 times per week) so there’s that. Just needs a protein boost now and again I guess."
_un1ty,qtxig2,"Fine hair has less protein naturally than coarse hair and protein can help in such case (also to hold a wave/curl etc.) , regardless of porosity, high por fine hair probably just needs even more protein!"
caseypham07,qtxig2,"im no expert, but it sounds a little strange that you have low porosity hair and have problems with hydration. you might have high porosity. low
porosity hair has a lot of protein and is always looking for moisture (hence the insane frizz i get from my low porosity hair). high porosity is pretty set with hydration but really needs products with lots of proteins.

if your hair feels dry but also feels over moisturized, you could have protein or hydration overload depending on what level of porosity your hair is"
xcptnl55,qtxig2,Your hair sounds like mine but I don’t have any recommendations as I am also just looking for a low glycerin gel for winter. But nice to see someone else with my hair woes.  And the diffused until bored. Yep. Me. I hate diffusing&&&I still need a protein kick now and again as well.
Fartingprincessss,qtwn5v,"Can someone help me with my hair type? It gets flat, fizzy and oily really quickly and has a lot of flyaways. I use a very basic drugstore shampoo and conditioner and oil the scalp thrice a week. Considering starting a CGM routine, so inputs on that would help too. Thanks:)&&&&&&So I oil my scalp with some cold pressed coconut oil an hour before washing, after which the scalp gets quite oily by day 2, making it a necessity for me to wash it again, but if I'm washing my hair, I have a habit of massaging the scalp with some oil before, and the cycle continues. Do you think they're related? I'm sorry I'm a mega noob when it comes to hair care, but I do want to start taking efforts to make it healthier."
KindheartednessSad55,qtwn5v,"You have hair like me!!! So our main thing is our hair isn’t as dry (needing oil) as it is dehydrated (needing hydration/water). If you can afford it, try the Kevin Murphy “hydrate me shampoo.” Your life will be changed. Also, definitely put oil on the ends out of the shower, but look for leave in conditioners as well."
WeAreStarless,qtwn5v,">It gets oily really quickly
>
>(...)
>
>I oil the scalp thrice a week

could those two possibly be related? 😉"
_un1ty,qtwn5v,Not OP but thank you your comment is really helping me out
kalifranks7,qtwn5v,"Ahhh the frizz could easily be from build up on your hair from drug store shampoo. Even if it seems simple enough you should always be using salon quality especially for curly hair. Start by clarifying your hair with any clarifying shampoo, get new shampoo and conditioner and do deep conditioning sessions (mids to ends 20 min) once a week. Use a leave in conditioner for hydration and oil (preferably argan) mids to ends. And also try out a dry shampoo for the oily scalp!
(Coming from a hairstylist with 2c hair)"
UnderstandingOne5205,qtwepj,Wanted to see if I have wavy hair. This is one week with new products (Pantene baobab shampoo and garnier fructis mango conditioner). Starts sort of wavy but falls straight throughout the day. What can I do to enhance waves and make them last longer? I have long hair so it does weigh down&&&&&&I’m not really sure how to tell but my hair strands are sort of thicker so I’d guess coarse. Why does coarseness matter? Also thanks for the tip- I will look into gel/mousse options
caseypham07,qtwepj,"i have thicker, coarser, wavier (2b/2c) hair than you but mine get weighed down super easy too. gel worked well for a while but the buildup was insane. the not your mothers brand of products has helped a lot. theyre lightweight with rice protein which seems to work well for me. i have low porosity hair which generally means i need more moisture and less protein but so far ive avoided protein and hydration overload using the not your mothers brand. i would def check your hair porosity and make sure youre using shampoo/conditioner with extra hydration/protein as needed"
whit_flinn,qtwepj,"It looks like you have 2a hair, is your hair pretty fine or coarser? I’d add in a lightweight gel or mouse if you want your waves to appear. Longer hair means your pattern will get weighed down no matter what so layers would help but if you want to keep it long then adding gel or mouse to your routine will help."
FederalHeat710,qts0ew,"2a? 2b?? What is my hair type? Long hair photos = not styled but damp. Short hair scrunched. How to care for it? Thick hair, fine texture. Often gets dry but then weighed down.&&&&&&Porosity: when I did the strand test, it was low porosity. Im unsure. 

Strand thickness: fine 

Density: extremely thick. Volumous if not brushed down. 

Current products: kms color vitality shampoo and conditioner; shea moisture anti frizz mouuse; Garnier fruit(????) Gel; goldwell surf oil texturing spray....&&&In these long hair photos, when my hair 100 percent dried it would straighten. These were like an hr after a shower still slightly damp"
Chemical-Bend-8832,qtrgg1,"When your bangs are wavy 3a but the rest of your hair is so long it can't hold curls so it's a 2a.Ahh,so anoying!Any tips&&&&&&Oh ok thanks&&&Idk really i wash my hair 2 times a week i use a custom conditioner and shampoo,my hair is medium thickness,low density semi-damaged ,fine hair&&&I've been thinking about that but I'm scared I'm not gonna like it"
MsSureFire,qtrgg1,"Ug! I feel this in my soul.

I get the best 2c/3a ""wurles"" in the front, and then soft 2a in the back.

At least most people see me from the front, so I guess that's the upside.

I wish I had some tips, but I'm just as lost as you, lol."
caseypham07,qtrgg1,"i did a big hair chop a few months back and it really
rejuvenated my curls. i didnt get layers but i got some thinning on the ends and some framing pieces. i can definitely tell the difference and theyre much lighter and bouncier now."
kalifranks7,qtrgg1,Honestly get some layering maybe about 1-2 inches above your over all length. And a tiny bit of slide cutting to help your curls bounce back up!
lavenderchild2166,qtrgg1,"I have the same problem! I get bouncy curls around my face and the rest of my hair some low waves. I think my hair is too heavy to support the curls, I have thick hair that goes past my chest. Getting a few inches cut this week with some added layers so hopefully that helps!"
10MileHike,qtr7e4,"Here's the cut if you want to do it yourself......I also think this is a little more updated of that same look....not exact but a little less layered in back especially.      I never went to beauty school but have cut a lot of people's hair, as well as my own, just studying videos.  :)

I think it would look great on you and you don't have to blow dry it as straight as this one."
Autumnwood,qtr7e4,"Omigosh you're so cute 😀💕 I'm not an expert but I don't see why not! I would go for it. The models hairstyle is cute and bouncy. You just need that cut. Her hair seems very dry, and yours seems a little more oily (products or natural I don't know) so if you want it more like hers you couldn't let it get weighed down with products. Also I saw she uses a sea salt spray. That is drying on the hair."
ElectricalPirate14,qtr7e4,I know this isn’t what you’re looking for but I absolutely love your hair now!
JyCKatharsis,qtr7e4,"May I know what type your hair is? My hair looks like this when long. Also, what products do you use?"
Lillimay5,qtr7e4,"Gonna date myself here but that is literally just brushing your hair back with a pick and air drying. It’s odd to me it requires a video. it will probably turn out different each time based on humidity, hair types or if you add stylers. Mousse was kinda the 90s jam. Ally is older than me so she prob hit with aqua net and that was it."
Mingkittish,qtr7e4,"Yes! You could definitely rock it, I think it would frame your face very nicely 😊"
PHDbalanced,qtr7e4,"Oh hell yes, I think you could. Shags look so good on thicker hair. You’ve got plenty to thin out and texturize."
PristineAd9800,qtr7e4,Yes&&&That’s a pic and it’s very different then a wide tooth comb. It gives a diff lift and comb to the hair. J/S
Veganhemeroid,qtr7e4,"Personally I think you could totally rock it, it would be fuller than that persons but it would still look good!!! Though I do have to say I love thick wavy/curly hair and I think it can look better in a lot of hair cuts like the one you are asking about. I say do it and rock it!!"
alenam10,qtr7e4,Ok I’m sorry but I’m 35 - does anyone remember having these cuts in 1997 and absolutely hating them??!
ambient_pulse,qtr7e4,love ur don't talk to strangers shirt i am wearing the same one but in black!! love wicked clothes
buffster007,qtr7e4,That’s a Lisa Rinna cut
caseypham07,qtr7e4,"Do you think my hair could rock this cut? Idk bc my hair seems to be slightly thicker/frizzier/wavier than theirs and I live in a pretty humid climate...&&&&&&that is such a good frame of reference omg thank you&&&thanks for the insight!&&&hahaha i wish i got to live through the 80s/90s though it seemed like so much fun&&&thanks! i currently use shea moisture's leave in conditioner but usually neglect to use it when i normally do my hair because it gets weighed down so fast; i just put in curl cream and/or foam with some shea moisture shine spray for softness/shine/frizz and let it air dry but man does that frizz catch up with me throughout the day&&&i think i was just worried that the bangs would get super frizzy and unmanageable because my hair is usually pretty frizzy anyways (humidity on the east coast is probably not helping). i think ill do a test run later with sea salt spray on my hair now and see how it turns out. i feel the need to weigh my hair down with product because otherwise the frizz seems unbeatable 😩&&&i'll look into it! i've been trying to find a good balance between products that help define but dont weigh down my waves and so far the not your mothers line has worked well but im always looking for ways to improve the frizz&&&yeah i really like when my hair dries like it did in the second video of myself, kinda natural like curtain bangs. perhaps i could modify the cut to get that awesome texture with a more suitable frame around my face with longer curtain bangs. idk if youve seen squid game but im obsessed with sae-byeok's hair in it, maybe ill get it more to that length with the same texture as the person in the tiktok video!&&&yeah it seemed way simpler than i thought haha. ive never used sea salt though so maybe that helps. ill probably have to use a curl cream and leave in though for frizz control. i was born after 2000 so ive never seen these hairstyles unless theyre in old
movies/tv shows lol&&&how do you style them after washing?&&&im still on the fence but definitely leaning towards getting it, i still have a few weeks to decide anyways&&&:D&&&i agree it fits my personality for sure. my hair also grows super fast (i cut it above my shoulders in august and its down past my collarbones now) so a shorter cut might save me some money from my regular haircuts every couple months, which i cant even go to anymore because im a college student and i havent found a salon i trust near campus lol&&&as a person who gets up 5 minutes before my first class the styling aspect makes me nervous lmao, i can barely straighten my hair as is and never tried curling, but im willing to learn&&&thank you!!&&&im type 2b or 2c i think. low porosity as far as im sure but i dont avoid proteins in my products. i used to use OGX but everyone says its bad for your hair so i switched to maui moisture shampoo and conditioner (the pink bottle, lightweight and hydration for all hair types). never bleached my hair and usually get it cut above or around shoulder length straight across with some thinning at the bottom and framing pieces in the front. after i wash my hair i use the praying hands method to put a grape sized amount of not your mothers curl cream in one half of my hair and scrunch. my hair is pretty wet when i do this and i scrunch so water drips out. i repeat this on the other side. then i sometimes apply shea moisture leave in conditioner or not your mothers curl refresher cream. i finish off with shea moisture shine mist which adds a lot of shine and softness to my dark hair. then i use a 100% cotton towel or tshirt to scrunch as much water as i can out of my hair without it becoming too frizzy and let it air dry. as for refreshing, sometimes i add a little bit of not your mothers curl cream just to tame the frizz or if im feeling productive i will occasionally dampen my hair (or just go straight in with) some not your mothers curl refreshing cream. the not your mothers line works well for me because my waves get weighed down super easy and so far its been the only line ive found that helps define without weighing down. however its hold isnt that great and i usually wake up with mostly flat hair. sorry for the long reply, hope this gives you some insight!&&&ahhh im obsessed with my steven rhodes shirts theyre so fun!!!&&&thank you :D&&&thank you! nobody has ever made nice comments about my hair before, all these kind comments have me feeling so much more confident&&&https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8Vw4r8e/

they also have videos of their hair when it was long and medium lengths for reference if you want to see if you have the same texture/thickness before cutting!&&&thanks!&&&good idea. def want to thin it out on the sides so its not super bulky when its short and get a few layers for that texture&&&ahhh im so tempted now i didnt expect so many people to have such a positive attitude about the haircut&&&thank you! i was worried my hair has been thinning out for the past few years but i still think i have enough to work with if i got a shag too.&&&haha maybe the length but def not the texture/thickness, at least for my hair&&&wow thank you! i definitely dont trust myself cutting my own hair but ill take some notes about the video's style and show it to my stylist!&&&im so obsessed with short textured hair rn i just never have time for styling AHHH im one to wake up and go in 5 minutes, def not a morning person. maybe i should practice finding a good refresh routine because i still have yet to find a reliable one that doesnt make my hair super stringy"
catsgreaterthanpeopl,qtr7e4,"I like your current cut better. 

That being said, I have had the cut you want while I was growing out a pixie cut before. Depending on where the cut hits your curls, you may have issues with them flipping up at the ends really bad. I did and would have to selectively straighten sections at the ends. My hair is about as thick as yours, but mine is a bit curlier, so maybe you wouldn’t have that problem. Just food for thought."
crbarn06,qtr7e4,Yes! I had this exact style as a result of growing out a pixie and it was horrendous.
dontuniqueuponit,qtr7e4,I think you could totally rock it! I’ve been dealing with humidity frizz too….gonna try morning refreshing with leave-in conditioner
eveoneverything,qtr7e4,"I think Ally Sheedy’s hair in Breakfast Club is what you could expect (which looks great, by the way)"
fishbitch21,qtr7e4,I think you could ABSOLUTELY rock this
freethenip,qtr7e4,"omg yes, your current hair is already so cute but you’d rock it for sure 🥺"
kunibob,qtr7e4,"Hahaha I did the trendy hair chop in 1996 and this was definitely my 1997.&&&I recently chopped my hair shorter/layers, and it's really freeing how much less product I need and how much more springy my waves are! That being said, waves do tend to take on a mind of their own, so some days, they curl in by one side of my jaw, and point out like crazy cat whiskers on the other. Or both sides curl strongly under and my hair gets a mushroom shape. Or the top layers stick out and then bottoms curl under. I usually try to control with sprayed water + Denman brush...try. But I am still happy with my decision. 

So if you don't mind a bit of extra styling, go for it! If you try and you don't like it, you could regrow your current length quickly. But you might be pleasantly surprised!"
mommafo,qtr7e4,I totally think so.
myly2,qtr7e4,Have your tried Curlsmith’s air dry cream?  I like your waves the way they are and I think this cream would help you make the most of your current cut.  Your face shape is different from the model’s so I wouldn’t recommend it.
napaficionado,qtr7e4,"I think it would look amazing on you! I really love that style btw, and it think it would really fit you (from what i can see of the clothes you’re wearing etc)&&&Do you have a link to your reference vid btw? I think i might show it to my salon next time 😂"
owouwuimcomingforyou,qtr7e4,"i have the models haircut and a very similar hair type to yours, 100% go for it! i hardly have any problems with the bangs and the haircut barely needs any maintenance (at least for me). :)"
pleborio,qtr7e4,Absolutely!!
plzturnoffmybrain,qtr7e4,Do it! You already have that cool girl vibe so I think it would look great on you!
purplejanuary14,qtr7e4,Make sure to go to a good hair stylist and ask them to thin out your hair as well.

spooky_fairy,qtr7e4,"I say you go for it!! I think you’d look adorable! And even if you end up not liking it, it’s hair, it always grows back :))"
super_vegan_alice,qtr7e4,"I have a similar wave pattern to you (when i have a similar cut). I think it’ll look great. You’ll have to figure out the best way to style it, and might need to curl or straighten some pieces, but I think it will easily look similar to hers, and will be easy to maintain and suit you well."
verytinytim,qtr7e4,"The shaggy layers absolutely. The bangs I think you would want to modify a bit for your face shape. Your face is widest at the cheekbones, so I’m not sure if you’d want the bang to cut off there- maybe go slightly longer. I do like the idea of a parted bang on you. A hairstylist may have a different opinion though, I find it’s always good to go in with something in mind but then discuss with them how you could modify the cut to be most flattering on you. You can try to test it out too by pinning the front pieces of your hair like bangs, play around and see what works."
Applipla,qtl64n,Did the silk pillowcase make a big difference? I’m still undecided about getting one.
HourCricket2402,qtl64n,"I have a satin pillowcase and it's great, I can't sleep with my hair tied up at all. I usually just need to quickly refresh a few curls in the morning but it's very low effort. I'm definitely gonna upgrade to a silk one soon. I think I have 2b/2c waves/curls for reference"
MrsE2010,qtl64n,"Satin pillowcase and medusa clipping work best for me.

Commonly referred to as a “pineapple” but many of the curly/wavy groups are trying to steer clear of that term now if you don’t have type 4 hair.

Infinite-Homework918,qth8ui,"Fine and wavy, a breakthrough&&&[removed]"
Doot24,qtgtsz,"Mine is similar to this as well! I'm 2 something, I usually call it 2b because without any product/styling I'm more of a 2a/2b and with I can be closer to a 2c. I feel your pain, I've never found curl charts with pictures that quite match my hair."
WeAreStarless,qtgtsz,"my hair is like this as well! i'd call it 2c if i absolutely had to, but i try to avoid curl typing as much as possible. like you said, it's a shortcoming of the chart, and it's only one of many. it's a very flawed categorisation system"
fishbitch21,qtgtsz,"loose spiral hair type?&&&I have a fairly loose wave pattern. I would guess around 2b but I've always had a little bit of a hard time classifying it. The hair typing chart defines wavy hair as having an S shaped wave. My texture is too loose to be curly but also forms distinct spirals rather than an S shape, especially when it is short. I was just curious if anyone out there has a similar texture? And how would you classify it? Is the variation in texture just a shortcoming of the hair typing chart? My texture is a little hard to photograph because my hair is dark but I've included a couple pictures for reference.

routine: My routine is pretty simple. Acure curiously clarifying shampoo and conditioner, squish to condish. I usually I use not your mother's defining cream followed by a strong hold gel. Plop in a cotton t shirt for \~30 mins and then air dry (except for my bangs which I blow dry). I find that my hair does not stay nearly as defined when it's long, I also think it could use some protein to help with this.

- Giovanni Air-Turbo Charged Mousse

I do squish-to-condish method in the shower and the leave-in conditioner and mousse is usually applied on wet (not dripping) hair. 

What else can I do? :("
oatbevbran,qtfwqt,Have you tried Denman brush styling to get larger clumps?
zinasbear,qtfwqt,"Looks dry, try an oil soak :)"
Peps0215,qtbojj,Gorgeous!
fishbitch21,qtbojj,"Wow this looks great! I have looser waves and wouldn't have thought to use a denman brush, might have to give it a try."
gardenvarietymagpie,qtbojj,"Thanks so much for this info. I ordered a Denman online last week and am super excited for it to arrive. Your results look great, I can’t wait too see what it does for my wavy hair too."
plzturnoffmybrain,qtbojj,I have 2b-2c waves and I’ve been loving using the denman brush. It helps create loose spiral clumps as opposed to the random wonky waves I get when I just scrunch. Your hair looks great!
sparkling_stars,qtbojj,"My experience using the denman brush for the first time! See comments&&&&&&When i was researching denman brush techniques there were a lot of mixed answers about if it works on wavy hair. My hair is around 2b, medium density, fine, and low porosity. Heres my experience and hopefully it might be helpful to somebody. 

First- a disclaimer. Where i live the denman brush is only available online and its really expensive. So i found a cheap knockoff on amazon called the Diane brush (lol). It worked pretty well for me. 

The brush comes with 9 rows and I started with 5. 

I washed with Maui moisture hibiscus shampoo and detangled/squish to condish with alba botanica plumeria. I raked in kinky curly knot today. About a quarters size. 

I sectioned off the top of my hair and started on the bottom layer and took medium sized sections. I used the technique from Manes by Mells video.[this one. ]( https://youtu.be/G1WPc1giU8Y)
After doing each section i would give it a little scrunch. 

What was really great was doing my top layer separately and brushing up for volume. In the front i let the waves fall to the side for more volume. 

I glazed strong hold gel emulsified with water on each clump after brushing. And a bit of mousse at the end. (mousse probably wasn’t necessary). 

Diffused till about 50% dry then air dry because I was too lazy to diffuse the whole way.

I will definitely be using the brush again. My waves are looking great and not wonky after 3 days. The best part was it helped make some of my sections more consistent instead of getting odd poofy, stringy or straight sections. 

Next time I will try bigger sections and using more of the rows, as i felt my hair slipping out of the brush sometimes. I think more rows will help the brush to grab onto my fine hair."
Mybishop,qt9u18,LOVE THIS 🖤
akchica23,qt9u18,Unrelated but your brows are amazing!
badtranslatedgerman,qt9u18,Has anyone ever told you that you look like a younger Rachel Bloom?? https://i.imgur.com/ymarAJ7.jpg
breadgal1,qt9u18,"I'm a criminal - brushed out my waves tonight but I actually love the result!&&&&&&My usual routine:

Shampoo with Noughty 'wave hello'

Condition with Maui Moisture shine+awapuhi, squish to condish, completely rinse 

Flora and curl curl lotion (leave in) raked upwards and outwards through hair 

Using the deman brush method, create curl clumps. (I can't explain it well but the youtuber IndiaBatson really helped)

Once performed over whole head, scrunch Flora and curl foam all over head.

Then Flora and curl's curl gel, emulsified with water. Scrunch into already formed curl patterns.

Diffuse on medium heat! I never really have a crunch to scrunch after, the product seems to disappear itself from the movement of diffusing.

I did all of the above on my washday (2 days ago), but just brushed them out today with denman brush"
cqbeswater,qt9u18,what did u do in your makeup?? obsessed
fluffysuccy,qt9u18,"I always brush mine after day 2, it's a bit poofy at first but re settles into clumps after a while with a softer look."

madeanaccount4baby,qt9u18,"Yas! Love the way my waves look brushed out, too! Underrated look if your hair can handle it"
