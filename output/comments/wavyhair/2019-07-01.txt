acf0615,caftt6,Daughter with wavy hair&&&My 11 year old daughter's hair has recently become very wavy. It looks great since its summer and we can let it air dry. My concern is once she goes back to school. She showers at night and by morning she has crazy bed head. The only solution I can come up with is to brush it which turns it into a puffy mess. She's also in the throws of puberty so she does have a greasy scalp. Any solutions? Products or routine change up. We also live in Ohio so sending her out with a wet head won't be an option in a few months.&&&Thank you! All sound like really good solutions. I'll definitely get her a silk pillow case!&&&I've never heard of curl refreshers. I'll definitely look into it!
daisy2687,caftt6,"Look into 'plopping' as a drying method. Can be done overnight!  I'd use a curl refresher product in the morning and maybe some root pump, depending on her hair texture."
katteykatt,caftt6,"As everyone has stated pineapple & satin pillow is probably the best route. But some sulfate free shampoo & silicon free conditioners + gel may help as well. There are plenty of cheap options out there. Personally I use Not your Mothers curl talk line and I find it doesn't weigh down my hair & reduces the frizz. I got the conditioner, shampoo, curl cream, & gel for 23 dollars at ULTA when they were doing a BOGO deal. There are cheaper options too. 

Additionally, she should probably forgo brushing her hair when it's drying or dry. Instead she can use a wide tooth comb in the shower to detangle her hair when she is conditioning."
productivefidgeter,caftt6,"Have you thought about a satin pillowcase? That can really help with frizz. Put a bit of curl cream in her head to moisturize and define before bed, then let her sleep on a silk pillowcase with her hair in a pineapple. I think for her age this is the simplest solution!"
youmeyoumeus,caftt6,Pineappling while sleeping on a satin pillowcase should help the situation.
