KateLB96,d4t4kp,Same!! So annoying because I feel like it looks so unkempt
MapleSyrupPO,d4t4kp,Same here
Sharkelberryfinn,d4t4kp,"Cut some layers into it and start a routine. I've started ""plopping""  my hair with a bit of curl activator creme and it's been helping. Use a diffuser on your hair dryer to set the wave, but disturb your hair as little as possible. Stop flat ironing or using curling irons. Sleep with your hair in a ""pineapple,"" which will also give you some lift at your roots.

That's all I've got so far, but it's been helping!"
Unkn0wn-Human,d4t4kp,Same! Anyone knows why??? And how to make all of it even?
aNiceSimpleUsername,d4t4kp,Mine too. I try all these things but layers and finger coiling work best. Anyone know of any good blow dryers/diffusers? Mines a cheap revlon but it takes so long I’m frying my hair. I want something that will be faster (<$100)
avberdy,d4t4kp,My hair is super curly on the bottom and super straight on top&&&
frillytilly,d4t4kp,Mine too.. can't win.
konecthedots,d4t4kp,I got a BabylissPro nano titanium. But you have to buy a diffuser separately. It’s got three heat settings and three speeds. I like it and it’s reasonably priced&&&Same. I’ve been trying to finger coil (is that the term?) some of the top layers while it’s drying. I’ve heard some people say they start curling better on their own after awhile. But I don’t know if that’s true or not.
tantrix_,d4t4kp,"If I don't diffuse this is exactly what I get as well. Have you tried diffusing?

You could also try finger coiling the top layer of hair as well to encourage it a bit before drying."
