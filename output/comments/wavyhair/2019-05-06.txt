tiddle49,blx1k2,"I have to share my new holy grail product I’m obsessing over for my hair&&&I’ve damaged my hair by chemicals. Changing color bleaching over and over. So I lost my curls and my hair doesn’t know if it’s straight, wavy and on a rare occasion, curly. I have to say I also sometimes stray from Sephora and try other beauty stores, but I always come back to my rightful owner lol! Purchased a lot of stuff today, including IGK No More Blow Air Dry Spray. It’s for everyone, including curly wavies. It’s an aerosol but despite that the fine mist offers volume, hold, texture and no smell plus your hair dryer is not necessary! It’s a big can for $24 bucks. I layered Ouai Rose Hair and Body Oil, 1.5 oz. for Around $15 at Sephora on top bc well I’ve got tons of damage.  Just thought I’d share."
