Maiyawyn,jdm78n,"Your hair looks very healthy and frizz-free. If you are like me, you might always strive to bring out more and more texture but, honestly your hair looks pretty flawless."
Panineat,jdm78n,Not perfect? You sure?
SuperSaiyanEva,jdm78n,"Not perfect but making progress I think :)&&&&&&Lol stahp. You're too kind :)&&&Omg we are! But yours is prettier! Lol :) I remember your post from a couple weeks ago lol. Yes check it out. I've fallen in love with the leave in and the custard with just one use.&&&Lol thank you :) Im def gonna try putting it up further. I was a bit wary of doing so cus I didn't want dirty roots the next day lol but these products feel so different from what I've tried in the past I feel like they shouldn't cause lots of build up.   


The capillary schedule is a way of making sure your hair is getting what it needs in regard to moisture, protein and nutrition. Your schedule will be based on what your hair needs. Usually its washing your hair 3 times a week and alternating hydration, nutrition and repairing masks. I only wash my hair about once a week so I've adjusted to my needs. OrganicallyAnna on YouTube has some videos on it. I guess people use it as a way to promote hair growth but Im just tryna get that healthy hair balance after damaging it for so long&&&That means a lot. Thank you :) I've been trying so hard to get it to a healthy state after bleaching it and I think possibly putting myself into protein overload. I even cut a good amount off recently. This is the first time in a long time I've seen my hair look this way. I def have a bit of that curl chaser bug in me but as long as my hair is healthy I'll be happy :)&&&What I did was sleep in the cast but its probably not necessary. I put it in a loose ponytail at the nape of my neck just to gather it then covered it with a silk scarf. Its kind of hard to explain and I had a hard time doing it lol but it basically looked like an extra large silk bonnet for long hair. I plan on getting one. I just wanted to avoid bunching it all up on the top of my head.   


But the next night I section my shorter front pieces out and gather my hair in a very loosely twisted bun on top of my head and secured it with one of those coily plastic hair ties. Very loosely though. And then tied a silk scarf like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/tLFSZgxgRgQDuNcX8) My hair didn't have any weird bends and wasn't frizzy after taking it out :) But one of those silk bonnets might be the best way to go&&&Trying to follow the capillary schedule kinda, using repairing, moisturizing, and nutrition masks.

Last picture is from about a week ago. Washed with Tresemme Botanique Color Vibrance and Shine Shampoo and conditioned with Eden BodyWorks Jojoba Monoi Deep Conditioner and added coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, almond oil and avocado oil (nutrition part of capillary schedule). Let that sit with a heated cap for 30 minutes and rinsed out using TRESemm√© Botanique Conditioner Nourish & Replenish Coconut & Aloe Vera as kind of a co-wash to get the oil out but staying away from the scalp. Plopped for 30 min and scrunched in Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Boosting Mousse and let air dry.

This wash day I chelated with ion hard water shampoo and used a bit of Sauve clarifying shampoo on my scalp. Then washed with Tresseme Botanique shampoo. Conditioned with Mielle organics babassu & mint deep conditioner and SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein-Strong Treatment and 5 drops of Colorful Products Neutral Protein Filler (as a repairing mask) Left on for 30 min with heated cap then fully rinsed out.

Plopped for a min and sectioned off hair and applied Kinky Curly Knot Today leave in then Kinky Curly custard. Whole time spraying hair with water and scrunching to try to create clumps. Then glazed and roped in Aussie Freeze Gel and scrunched. Styling right side up. Micro plopped. Pixie diffused till almost dry and let it air dry the rest of the way. Slept in the crunch in a silk scarf with my hair gathered in the back kind of sitting in a bag and tied in the front.

SOTC in the morning with some Argan oil. I was afraid to scrunch it out totally cus frizz.

Last night I slept with my hair loosely in a twisted bun on top of my hair with my ""bangs"" pulled out and wrapped with a silk scarf cus I didnt want them smushed down. Today I refreshed with the tiniest bit of water glazed over and then some argan oil glazed over and scrunched up a bit

Next wash day I wanna try applying styling products in the shower upside down to wet hair"
YeetTheBeet0,jdm78n,"idk if someone already asked, but how do you sleep with it? second day hair is always a mess for me :("
dianacakes,jdm78n,I feel like you're my hair twin except yours is longer! I really need to try Knot Today.
sassysassysarah,jdm78n,"My only thought is have you tried putting product a little further up your hair?

But that's the only thing I could think of that might make an improvement üòÖ it's so pretty as is

What's the capillary method and where do I learn more about it?"
DogDressedAsCowboy,jdhtb7,"Long heavy 2a/2b hair is unpredictably wavy&&&crossposted in r/curly hair bc i‚Äôm desperate üò´

Over the past year I started dabbling in CGM, with very little success. I‚Äôm getting tired of buying new hair products and being disappointed. I‚Äôm hoping someone with similar hair texture will have tips/tricks/product recs. 

I‚Äôve attached a [photo of my hair air dried](https://imgur.com/a/h2layqY). It‚Äôs mid to low back length, 2a/2b virgin hair never dyed, prone to split ends, easily knotted, and fine but thick & heavy. 

My current routine is shampoo + condition every day/every other day, no more than 2 days between washes, squish to condish + let it sit for most of the shower + then brush through with wide tooth comb and rinse out. i part and brush through again soaking wet out of the shower, then air dry. 

if i want it to look actually wavy, i put my dried hair in a low twisted bun and secure with a soft scrunchie. the waves fall out after about 2 hours though and i‚Äôll
continuously put it back into low bun, let it down etc. hairspray seems to weigh it down faster and make it frizzier.

I tried the V05 clarifying, Suave Coconut conditioner co-washing routine for a while and it left the length of my hair feeling dry & frizzy immediately and my roots were really greasy by the next day. 

My hair sucked up the suave conditioner, I had to use nearly half the bottle to thoroughly condition, and it still didn‚Äôt feel like it penetrated yknow?

Same thing with Tresseme Botanique conditioner, Olaplex conditioner, Aussie miracle moist, other budget options i got from r/curlyhair

But at the same time, argan oil, moroccan oil products, and most ‚Äúshine‚Äù products i‚Äôve tried weigh my hair down and make it look + feel greasy.

So I‚Äôm kinda confused about what porosity my hair is. 

My other thing is, if I take a nap/lay down for a few hours with my hair in a low ponytail, when my hair is wet right out of the shower, sometimes it forms perfect looking waves? that‚Äôs leading me to believe that gravity + the weight of my long hair might be what‚Äôs preventing my hair from forming waves when i‚Äôm upright airdrying. if that‚Äôs the case, would diffusing be a good option for me? 

i‚Äôve tried plopping with a tshirt but my hair just never fully dries when its wrapped up on top of my head. i just bought a microfiber turbie twist though so i‚Äôll see if that makes a difference.

i‚Äôve only tried one mousse (nymothers curl talk) but it made my hair sticky and crispy with no waves, like uncooked spaghetti/straw. 

i just bought neutrogena anti residue shampoo, nymothers curl talk defining cream, aussie instant freeze gel, and garnier fructis sleek&shine leave-in conditioner to try (not all at the same time)

If you read through all this, thank you!! any suggestions/tips are welcome and appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è&&&i‚Äôm gonna try this method the next time i wash my hair. thank you!&&&in the past when i‚Äôve used gel, my hair was just hard and stringy even after scrunching. but it could just be a technique issue. i‚Äôve never heard of roping and i don‚Äôt know much about clumping. looks like i need to do some more research!

my hair takes forever to dry too. i haaaate blow drying, ideally i‚Äôd like a quick routine, or something that‚Äôs mostly hands-off so i can do my makeup etc in the meantime yknow?&&&i‚Äôm definitely getting a haircut soon, i haven‚Äôt had it cut since February üò¨ i really like both of those cuts, thank you for the suggestion!"
Jasmisne,jdhtb7,Have you figured out your porosity? I think that will make a huge difference on what works for you
MrsTruce,jdhtb7,"Sounds like you have low porosity - takes forever to dry, gets weighed down easily, etc. Also, since the coconut conditioner seems to have dried your hair out, you are very likely coconut sensitive. You might consider laying off of things that contain coconut for a while. 

With low porosity hair, you will also benefit from deep conditioning with heat to open the cuticle. 

One other thing I‚Äôd recommend is a mild protein treatment. Something like a rice water rinse just to test the waters and see if your hair responds positively to protein. The dryness and lack of definition signals a protein deficiency, but it‚Äôs easy to go overboard, so don‚Äôt jump straight to a ‚Äúprotein treatment‚Äù product. Rice water is nice and light, and you‚Äôre unlikely to overload if that wasn‚Äôt the correct answer."
NichelleMcD,jdhtb7,"Okay, so I‚Äôm new to cgm and caring for wavy hair, but I think I can help. I hair fine, very dense hair like you and here‚Äôs what worked and didn‚Äôt work for me (so far). 
I brush my hair in the shower with an actual brush when the conditioner is in my hair. Before I get out of the shower I wet my hair and brush with a wide tooth comb. Since my hair is fine, I use the brush to detangle and make sure the conditioner gets all over. I use the wide tooth comb at the end of the shower to make sure my hair clumps breaks into clumps (it‚Äôs like a solid helmet after brushing). 
After shower and with soaking wet hair, I flip it upside down and put in a leave-in conditioner and/or detangler. The Curls Blueberry Bliss leave-in conditioner is too heavy for my hair. I use NMY Mango Butter detangler spray and/or NMY Curl Talk leave-in conditioner. The detangler spray makes my hair soft and silky without weighing it down. 
Afterwards, I scrunch some of the water out with a microfiber towel. Then I put in Aussie instant freeze gel. The NYM Curl Talk mousse made my hair disgustingly sticky, too.
The I plop it in a turbie twist for a while. But I also have like three of them so when one gets soaking wet, I swap it out to a dry one. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre supposed to do that, but it‚Äôs the only way to get my hair REMOTELY dry. I shower at night, so I usually dry with a diffuser on low with low/med heat because I can‚Äôt stand going to bed with wet or damp hair. I sleep with my hair in a pineapple and it usually looks great in the morning. If my hair is extra frizzy in the morning, I put like two sprays of OUAI wave spray in and finger brush. 
Also, I NEVER brush my hair once I‚Äôm out of the shower. It completely ruins any wave/curls for me and makes my hair crazy frizzy/poofy (think Hagrid from HP) 
I‚Äôm sorry for the super long comment, but I know your struggle, and I hope it helps!"
Ninja_Pollito,jdhtb7,"So I am not an expert.  In fact, I have only been in the process for a few months.  I have extremely fine hair--so much so that sometimes I cannot see a strand very well, but I can feel it.  Like you, my curls fall out easily and mine seem to be easily disturbed.  I was thinking back to when I just shampooed, conditioned and used one product (then air dry), I had the most definition in places without doing much.  Very low manipulation. However, according to curly hair rules, I washed too often.  Now that I have tried to go semi CGM, my hair looks awful A LOT.

I am not totally certain, but I suspect I have moderately low porosity hair.  Everything weighs it down.  So I started doing some research.  This eventually led me to a lesser viewed YouTuber/blogger who calls her brand the Holistic Enchilada.  She has very fine hair and easily disturbed curls.  Now she has high porosity and low-density hair, but she seems to have the same issues as me.  So I went down the rabbit hole on her videos and blog and it gave me some things to consider.

She cannot really co-wash.  In fact, she has to condition very little.  She cannot layer products as it weighs her hair down.  She has to clarify, and deep condition periodically.  Like you, she does have long hair.

Now some of that may not apply to you.  I am not sure.  If your hair is not getting enough moisture, it may not be getting into your strands.  You may have to use heat in some way (steam, heated bonnet, etc) to get the conditioner into the hair.

I am frustrated and really trying to figure things out.  I don't have a ton of money to try product after product.  I know your pain.  Maybe some of these thoughts will be of some value to you.  :)"
SavannahInChicago,jdhtb7,"The only way I can hold my curls if I put in gel. I do it when it‚Äôs damp, not wet. 

Also, to get conditioner in I have to scrunch it with conditioner while upside down and get as much water in as I can. I forget what the method is called."
Spaghettio225,jdhtb7,I don't know all that much about hair but I'm learning so I can give you a few tips. First of all it's not healthy to wash your hair every other day. Washing it every other day with shampoo is going to dry it out and especially damage your scalp. I used to do this and now I wash mean once a week. Another thing I'd suggest is not to use your basic dollar store shampoo like Suave or Aussie. There's a lot of other brands that are so much better for hair like Shea Moisture. And I understand that these brands can be more expensive but it's completely up to you if you want spend your money on this.
SusantheBlue,jdhtb7,"A good shampoo/conditioner will do wonders. I‚Äôve found that CG approved shampoos don‚Äôt always work the best for wavies, so don‚Äôt limit yourself to just those. Stay away from heavier product like curl creams (unless they work for you! Everyone is different) that will weigh your hair down. And a diffuser is a life changer for wavy hair! Get a good cup diffuser if you can and use this instead of plopping, or do a combination of the two. 

I‚Äôve been taking care of my wavy hair and getting decent results for the last 17 years. It‚Äôs all trial and error but you‚Äôll eventually find what works for you. I have 2b/2c waves, use whatever shampoo/conditioner I feel like at the moment, herbal essences totally twisted mousse then diffuse and touch up with John Frieda frizz control cream and sometimes a good hairspray for extra hold."
aghastghost,jdhtb7,"I have been using OGX pracaxi oil shampoo and using the comb-thru leave in to detangle and I am liking the results. My hair hits mid-waist and is pretty dry 2b thick hair. I have to wash it every other day (and sometimes more) due to working out, and it has been a lot softer and waves very nicely."
cheesecockfucktory,jdhtb7,I have very similar hair! look up a YouTube vid on flaxseed gel by Isabella Demarko
cinnaselly,jdhtb7,"We have such similar hair length, colour and type and I also experience the weight of lots of fine hair dropping the curls, it's all flat on my head and a few inches down"
dianacakes,jdhtb7,"I have high density, fine 2A/2B hair. Getting layers helped A LOT. Try a ""low poo"" sulphate free shampoo. I really like the Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Shampoo. I only clarify once Avery couple of weeks at the most. When you do use a clarifying shampoo, be sure to deep condition. I like Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen and Restore Treatment Masque because it has a good bit of protein but doesn't seem too heavy. When that's gone I intend to try the Manuka Honey and Yogurt one. Put a shower cap or plastic grocery bag over your head and wrap a towel around it to lock in the heat. I personally love Tresemme Botanique and other coconut heavy products, but your hair might not like coconut. Not saying you should toss them, definitely try low poo and deep conditioning first and then see how your hair reacts to coconut. 

Make sure you're applying products to get the most even distribution as possible. You should emulsify any clear gel with water (add a dot to wet hands and rub them together) until it turns white. That was my biggest mistake when I first started out. And I thought that since I have a lot of hair, I needed a lot of product. But I've been happier with my hair when I use less. I actually measure some products with a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon! I have to glazing and use praying hands over each section.

You don't mention diffusing but you might try hammock diffusing where you use a towel or t-shirt to support the weight of your hair while it's wet and dry it in sections starting at the scalp. [Here is a video ](https://youtu.be/MBkaec34Vkg)"
glittergirl-,jdhtb7,"What happens if you use gel? Have you tried roping? 

We have REALLY similar hair, although mine is dyed. I get pretty decent loose by focusing on clumping (lots of good videos out there on that) and getting the gel in while my hair is very wet - if I plop or towel-dry first I just get stringy frizz - and then scrunching/blotting a few times with a microfiber towel to get some of the water out and diffusing until it‚Äôs about 50-75% dry and the cast has hardened. Then I air dry the rest of the way and gently scrunch out the crunch (sometimes with a little anti-frizz serum on my hands) and hope for the best. I have whichever porosity means my hair takes forfreakingEVER to dry, so diffusing to 100% is more than my arms can handle - even 50-75% is rough unless I blast it on high the whole time which just leads to more split ends, bleh. 

I can get okay wavy results doing the same routine but skipping the diffusing, it just tends to fall faster."
greenestrella,jdhtb7,"I don‚Äôt have great recommendations for products but I do know if I comb or brush my hair after I‚Äôm out of the shower, even soaking wet, it will not clump or make waves no matter what products I use. 

I have started combing with a wide tooth comb *and* parting my hair while in the shower with conditioner in my hair. The water running over my hair helps it to clump as I comb. I rinse out most of the conditioner after parting then I add some leave-in conditioner.

When I get out, I add Aussie instant freeze gel with very gentle praying hands. I get my hands a little bit wet then scrunch my hair. I let it air dry and try not to touch it."
hyprsxl,jdhtb7,"Your hair kinda looks like mine. Have you thought of getting a haircut with more layers? I'm thinking like [this one](https://images.app.goo.gl/zhsqcjy2y1XLCcm26) or [this one](https://images.app.goo.gl/G73zhrTBkdgY574P6). Maybe if your hair is less weighed down, it'll yield more waves/curls :)"
littleprojects,jdhtb7,"Two months late but question for you: how long do the curls/waves last when you use this method? Your hair sounds a lot like mine, so I crept on your previous posts (lol sorry!) and saw the waves you achieved with the Herbal Essences mousse‚Äîthose look like the waves I‚Äôm currently able to get with Aussie Instant Freeze gel, but the problem is that my hair will dry with some nice waves (whether I air dry or diffuse), then 3-6 hours later, the waves have mostly fallen out. I‚Äôll be left with some curls at the ends and some good body in my hair (which tbh looks so much better than leaving the ends straight, what I was doing my whole life), but it doesn‚Äôt look wavy all over like it does when it first dries."
marlybobarly,jdhtb7,"I have similar hair, but I only clarify once every other week at most. I shampoo about every other day with Ouidad Playcurl, and the other days I use a co-wash such as Curlsmith‚Äôs Curl Quenching or As I Am AND I use a conditioner, but I don‚Äôt put the conditioner on my roots. I also never comb or brush my hair after I get out of the shower. If you can‚Äôt give that up, you will probably need a ton of gel or foam to get the waves to clump. 

I just got my first Deva Cut yesterday and the stylist gave me some good recommendations for my hair. You might try it to see what they recommend for your hair type."
notabigmelvillecrowd,jdhtb7,"You don't really need your hair to dry in a plop, it's just to get it started.  I would say try adding a lightweight leave in, some kind of strong hold product, and then plop for like an hour then diffuse or air dry and see what happens.

The picture also looks like it is pretty dry, I would suggest cutting down on washing.  I can't do cowash either with wavy hair, but a good low-poo every 4-5 days, and a heavy conditioner for the ends only really helps.  I used to get bad split ends too, but since sticking to cg I don't get them anymore.  Maybe a trim would be a good place to start so you get rid of the split ends and get a clean slate to experiment with."
unoriginal_bird,jdhtb7,"mine is dyed, but otherwise its very similar. I don't follow cgm ingredients, as my head was always itchy and I had to clarify often. I use the aussie curls miracle curls shampoo and conditioner, focusing the shampoo on my roots and the conditioner on my ends. I brush my hair while the conditioner is in it, rinse out some of the products so it's not as weighed down, and scrunch in some curls. then i twist it into a 100% cotton towel for about an hour to pull out a lot of moisture(i have. very low porosity hair and my hair takes hours to dry if I s2c). then I let it down, possibly add in the aussie curls curl defining oil in a very small amount, and scrunch in some more curls. however I do usually have some frizz, so if plopping works for you then that might be better."
JackieHendrix,jd53bk,"Help with hair&&&Hi! I‚Äôm new to this sub, and while I‚Äôve been looking through here and reading things, but it‚Äôs kind of overwhelming. Can anyone give me tips on where to start? I have 2b hair, and the products I‚Äôve started to use are Maui hibiscus shampoo and Maui coconut oil conditioner. I use a wide tooth comb in the shower while the conditioner is still in. After I get out of the shower I use a tshirt to dry my hair and while it‚Äôs damp I brush it w a paddle brush.

Thank you!&&&My hair just wont hold any waves. I‚Äôll braid my hair when it‚Äôs very very slightly damp and it‚Äôll be pretty wavy after I take them out..... for a total of 5 seconds. Then the waves die out. The curls are kind of 2c after I take them out, but then they just fall flat&&&I kinda need help figuring out how to make the waves stay and how to properly brush/ style them. Any product suggestions are greatly appreciated as well :)"
MonochromeBrunette,jd53bk,"Look into the curly girl method for wavy hair. I've just started dabbling in CGM, and I think you're kind of on that track already. 

I would skip the brushing while your hair is damp, because you're just pulling out your waves when you do that. Also add some leave-in products when your hair is wet or damp - this depends on preference, some like to put products in dripping wet hair, some like it better with damp hair. 

What leave-ins you use depends on preference also. You might find gel too heavy for your hair, but you'll see some benefit with mousse or cream. Scrunch it into your hair and then gently rake it through with your fingers, taking care not to pull out your waves. Then let it air-dry or use a diffuser to dry."
valkyriemama,jd53bk,What problems do you feel like your having? Are you getting clumps you're happy with?
miamibfly,jd1sc3,"What is your hair type?  Fine/course, low/high porosity please. Looks beautiful!!!"
mnw113011,jd1sc3,"I didn't use gel today and I like it!&&&&&&Today I used Maui moisture nourish and moisture coconut milk shampoo and Tresemme Pro Pure lightweight moisture conditioner. 

I style in the shower and flip upside down use a wet brush to comb through shea moisture strengthen and restore styling lotion. I then added bed head control freak serum and squished it all into my wet hair creating clumps. I then plop in a t-shirt.

I let sit in the plop for an hour. I then diffuse upside down the middle section first then roots then start at the bottoms and bring the diffuser up to my roots. I diffuse all the way dry. I then let my hair settle for ten minutes and add shea moisture daily hydration finishing oil serum only like two little pumps. Then apply a little tiny bit of hairspray to keep it together."
Wavyhaircare,jcztsn,"It looks to me like it dried while the back of your hair was pushed forward? I've had this happen when I stay leaned over too long while diffusing. I'd spray or otherwise re-wet the part sort of by your ear, and then once it's wet enough to fall down, try to get it to fall into an natural position and scrunch it, add more gel if it feels like it needs it, and let it dry again.&&&I can't really make sense of the back of your head well enough from this pic but if it feels like it's laying really strange or is just 'messy' i'd rewet and re-scrunch that portion as well."
WeAreStarless,jcztsn,"i agree with the other commenter, the issue is that you're styling it upside down. i would recommend styling it right side up / side to side instead, or, if you're really attached to upside down styling, check out [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEhuTDzpQDu/) and [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFhuV9LFf3H/) post on how to do it most successfully"
lalalala3101,jcztsn,"Messy hair after wash&&&&&&Thanks :)&&&This is my routine.

FrizzychunkCAT,jcix4p,"Day 5 Completely dry Denman brush refresh! I just posted yesterday.... but Day 5 hair, guys!!! Dry brush refresh!!! It‚Äôs finally happening!&&&&&&Day 5 hair. 
I posted yesterday about my day 4 refresh, which was pretty high effort for me (water and blow dryer were involved.) so that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. 
I only wanted minimal effort.
I just went around my head, took large clumps (maybe 10 total), brushed until smooth with denman, did that twirly denman thing to make it barrel curl. Then I sprayed a tiny bit of hairspray all over. Let it rest in those silly looking ringlets for 5 minutes while I got dressed and brushed my teeth. Then I tipped my head upside down, use a wide tooth comb to pick the roots all over, gave it a finger shake and gently spread some of the tighter barrel curls, tossed right side up and finished with a tiny bit more hairspray. it took maybe 5 minutes of effort. 
I feel like my hair looks almost as glam as when my stylist would use a blow dryer, curling iron, and tons of serum.  VICTORY!!!!!!

I have been trying dry brush refresh for months, this is my first 10/10 success.&&&[my first wash day, December 2019 - where I started from](https://i.imgur.com/vVuEIYp.jpg)"

I am surprised you can dry brush with a Denman, though. I can do a similar refresh with my wet brush on dry hair but my hair has to be WET and coated with a leave-in to get a Denman through w/o ripping hair out."

ausheidi,jchizn,"I only have good curls on day 2, day 1 looks blah and somewhat TOO soft? I have found it I do the forbidden and brush out my curls (very gently) then I can lightly mist and literally watch it draw up into sometimes ringlets. Like mist BAM. That‚Äôs also how I get good volume. When I do normal CGM it looks so lame lol."
fancylamp12,jchepm,"what hair type do you guys think i have??&&&&&&i used jojoba oil and if you see on my post in curly hair subreddit it actually got a lot wavier! i‚Äôm thinking my hair is more of a mix but the predominant texture is 2B imo&&&also it‚Äôs a mix, some says it looks a lot wavier and some days it‚Äôs not as wavy. i think it just fluctuates but i find that my day 3-4 is the best as it starts getting the oils it needs which results in wavier way. i also recently did clarify my hair which is why i‚Äôm not open to clarifying it right now especially since the color would wash right out&&&my routine: i wash my hair twice a week now with acure wave and curl wellness shampoo and becarelove color lock conditioner. if my hair is feeling especially dry, i will do a face mask with sauce deep moisture hair mask(contains avocado, argan oil and monoi oil) which i HIGHLY recommend. after shower, i plop my hair for 20 minutes and then add my leave in which is hask argan oil conditioning mist and then i do my mousse which is herbal essences curling mousse and then use garnier fructis curl sculpting gel but only a tiny amount, this is just to add definition! 
i know for sure my hair is fine, but medium density:) i‚Äôm just not sure what wave type it is considered as i used to think it was 2A until i started actually doing the routine correctly. the only thing i need tips on right now is how to clip my hair! i find that because i have fine hair, it gets weighed down by the water after a shower which causes it to dry flat but then on my refresh days it dries perfectly. i also notice my gel can dry out my hair a little so if anyone has recommendations for a good gel that won‚Äôt weigh down my fine hair i‚Äôd appreciate that too!
edit: i also redye my hair every 5 weeks however i use arctic fox and it has not caused any sort of damage! i am waiting for switch up the colors on my split dye for a few months so that when i bleach my hair it doesn‚Äôt get damaged. when i dye my hair i clarify it first so it grabs the color better:)&&&also to add i know some of my old pictures my hair looked straight, i was not taking care of my hair that well and was also overusing product as i didn‚Äôt understand less is better when it comes to waves, especially fine wavy hair! my hair used to get supperrrrr weighed down but i have kept myself to only 3 products and they have been working amazingly"
silvercorvus,jchepm,I'm curious what your wavy pattern looks like without silicones. I would say 2a here. The best way to have a clear picture of your hair type is to do a clarifying wash with no other products used (not even conditioner) then allow your hair to air dry.
claudiarae95,jcf0r8,Gorgeous! Looks so healthy and I love the color!
coffeewineimfine,jcf0r8,I LOVE your hair color! That‚Äôs the color I wish mine was
loathe-entirely,jcf0r8,"My best wash day so far and it looks and feels so healthy! I‚Äôm in awe that my hair can even do this after all the damage I‚Äôve inflicted upon it over the years.&&&&&&ROUTINE:

I‚Äôve been trying a lot of new products lately and my hair clearly didn‚Äôt like something or was resistant to a certain combination as it was becoming flat and not holding any wave at all. So I decided to take it back to basics.

Washed with Noughty To The Rescue shampoo, focusing on roots. Squished to condish with a handful of Noughty To The Rescue conditioner and combed it through with my tangle teezer to help the formation of the curl clumps. Left the conditioner in for five minutes whilst doing other shower stuff then rinsed out fully. Combed through once more to help get excess water out and reform the clumps.

Applied an egg sized amount of LA Looks Extreme Sport gel to my hair using praying hands method then squished it in until I had reshaped the curl clumps I‚Äôd created before. Plopped in a microfibre towel for 30 minutes. Once I‚Äôd let it down, I arranged my hair as best as I could without touching it (so as not to disrupt the gel - essentially just slowly flipped my head around a lot until everything was more or less sitting where I wanted it). Left it to air dry then scrunched out the crunch. It looked pretty wild at first but I gave it another 30 minutes to settle and this is the final result which I am over the moon with!!"
TheAlmightyJohnsons,jc4kz9,Yeah mine has multiple personalities. LOL
dontincludeme,jc4kz9,"It‚Äôs like this hair belongs to two different people&&&&&&Yeah. I‚Äôm just like ‚Äú...buy why‚Äù and also ‚Äúok, ok, I get it, you‚Äôre changing!‚Äù

I had straight hair with a very very slight wave my whole life, and I noticed maybe in April ‚Äò20 (it‚Äôs mid October now) that my right side was starting to go wavy, but at the back. It‚Äôs been slowly creeping towards the front lol. And now the other side is doing it too, but not as much. My grandma had curly hair, my mom has wavy hair (my dad has straight hair) so now I guess it‚Äôs my turn. I also turned 30 this year, so hormones/aging, and also went through a traumatic breakup, which I heard can also change hair (emotional stress)&&&I have tried a couple different routines that weren‚Äôt really working (in my post history), but today, I just washed it with the Spring and Vine Grapefruit and Rosemary shampoo bar (the one for volume). Blotted extra water with a T-shirt. Combed while still wet. Air dried. Argan oil from the collar bone to the ends. 

Also, the waves are on the underside. I have it clipped up to show the waves, and when I take the clip out, that section is straight. So when it‚Äôs all down, it‚Äôs like I have all straight hair"
ndhewitt1,jc4kz9,"My hair is the same. In fact, after a few weeks of styling it and pretty much each day it being 2b, yesterday I washed and didn‚Äôt style or put product in and it basically looks straight! It‚Äôs so weird. My guess is if you followed a technique and used a bunch of hind product you‚Äôd get waves all over, but parts of your hair are able to wave like this without hold product sometimes. My underneath curls without product and even if I comb it out wet. It‚Äôs versatile, which is nice!"
dontincludeme,jc1r3d,Where‚Äôs your yellow shirt from?
thartson,jc1r3d,"Best hair day yet! Even got a perfect little ringlet hiding underneath!&&&&&&I had to take new headshots since my old ones were with straight hair...so I was super careful about this wash day! Full disclosure, I did have to fix 3 curls with a curling iron, but overall still so proud of this wash! 
Shampoo scalp with Garnier Curl Nourish

S2C with Hask Keratin Protein deep conditioner (applied mid-length to tip first, flip head over, dip hair into the water, distribute/detangle with wet brush, lightly shake head to form curl clumps, finger coiled clumps, gently squished and pulsed at the top) 

Clipped up while I finished the rest of my shower routine.

Rinsed out (alternating letting the water stream over it and squishing).

Applied a tiny amount of Garnier Curl Nourish Leave-in distributing again with wet brush and finger coiling the clumps. Squished and pulsed at top.

Micro-plop with microfiber towel.

Applied Aussie Instant Freeze gel with praying hands.

Diffused roots first then hammock diffused.

Fluffed after dry. Finished with an Aussie strong hold hairspray (do not recommend for regular use, but fit the bill for my needs today). 

Scrunched out the hairspray crunch with a Garnier sleek and shine (the smallest pump I can do with it) with praying hands first, then a light scrunch. 

Fixed 3 curls with the iron on low.&&&It actually was from a friend I work with...and it doesn‚Äôt have a tag üòû"
itizzwhatitezz,jbyj1g,"Hi, I'm glad it works for you! Which brand do you use?"
megant113,jbyj1g,"I'm thinking about stealing my kids shampoo to do just this (mostly because I can't face buying yet another product).

Are you still using the kids shampoo?"
saylermewn,jbyj1g,"Kids shampoo update&&&A week using kids shampoo and I think that It‚Äôs working. My scalp isn‚Äôt as irritated and it looks like it‚Äôs helping my very fine hair not frizz as much. It could be placebo because I‚Äôve been wanting something to work for so long but so far so good. 

Thanks to the other redditor for suggesting it!&&&Johnson and Johnson because they don‚Äôt have the annoying smells like bubble gum.&&&Yes. It has worked so far!"
