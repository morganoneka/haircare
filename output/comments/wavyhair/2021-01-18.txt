AdoraThroughFire,l4eqis,Your hair looks absolutely amazing!!!!!
SadlyNotanAlien,l4eqis,"People seem to like the curl enhancing smoothie, I wish they had a product like that for type 2 hair!"
amv2926,l4eqis,"your hair looks incredible! is it fine or course and how thick/ dense would you say your hair is? just curious because i think mine is very similar to yours. also, how much of each product do you use?"
copper_moon,l4eqis,Beautiful!
melmalice318,l4eqis,"I am just starting my journey and have a very similar hair texture. I'm so glad to see that this is working for you, as I actually have just started with these products that you mentioned. This gives me a lot of hope!"
rnicholson1,l4eqis,"Grew up in a family that has straight hair, didn't know how to manage my waves till recently and I'm no longer feeling self conscious about my hair! Thanks you everyone!&&&&&&High porosity hair, highly frizzy normally. I was co washing but did not find success with that. My scalp hated it and the build up weighed my hair down. So I switched to shea moisture intensive hydration shampoo and conditioner. I wring my hair out, comb through shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie and palm apply sports gel. Probably should use a different gel but it hasn't dried out my hair and doesn't leave a hard cast. It's the life brand ultimate hold. Felt like crying today because it's the first time I've worn my hair down without a hat or putting it up in a bun instantly. Feels good.&&&Thank you so much :) I appreciate your kindness!!"
ruler_of_potatoes,l4eqis,Your hair looks beautiful! This is what I‚Äôm hoping my long wavy hair will look like soon.
violetpolkadot,l4eqis,Absolutely beautiful! I love your hair texture!

alicia_78,l4di90,help with Products and definition&&&So my hair is quite difficult when i come out the shower and i have washed my hair after shampooing and conditioning and after adding products my hair has like hardly any definition just slight frizzy waves and just a few curly bits and a lot of it turns out straight but when i come back after the rain i have all these curls and waves that pop up how do i achieve this after washing my hair i can never find a shampoo and condionier or styling product that will bring out my natural hair like that
00926,l4cg2e,Curious about this too!
Chloebugs,l4cg2e,"Not OP but I either wash/style my hair right before going to an appointment or take pictures of it freshly washed/styled and show my stylist. I have the kind of 2a hair that will fall straight after day one so some people look at me like I‚Äôm crazy when I say its wavy. You should definitely go for a curly cut if you want it tho, it totally changed my waves for the better"
Dani7137,l4cg2e,Looks amazing!! Do you plop at all?
KatenBaten,l4cg2e,"Hello fellow wavy, I'm about to make an appointment for my first curly cut. How did that conversation go? Did they believe you that your hair was wavy/curly? Did you style it a certain way before your appointment? I guess I have misgivings going for a curly cut when my hair isn't always obviously curly. Just nervous I guess."
Violet283,l4cg2e,Im sorry but whats a curly cut?

pilfernoodles,l4bay0,"Since you already have a conditioner you really like, try leaving a little of it in your hair during your wash routine‚Äîjust don‚Äôt rinse as thoroughly as usual.

Daisyfay1414,l4b6d0,"Do not recommend. I have the same kind of hair . (my tip : deep conditioning with protein, try to get your curls to clump, squish in a curl cream with the bowl method.

Izzygetsfit,l49ygc,"Styling products by design block water from getting in and out as easily. This helps to keep the hair in the desired shape, but the trade off is that it takes longer to dry."
Wavyhaircare,l49ygc,This is true for me as well. I think it's the norm pretty much.
me-me-123,l49ygc,"This happens to me too, especially when I use gel. (Which is why I wash my hair at night). Takes a while, but the results are worth it."

I'm having a super hard time finding wavy hair products that I can use with my allergies. I am allergic to peanuts/tree nuts/soy.

bryannadz,l478um,When do you know?&&&How long do you use a product before deciding if it works or not?
pilfernoodles,l478um,"depends on how it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot working‚Äù.

If I notice an immediate and significant poor affect (hair was really dry, major frizz, more brittle, super mushy, more limp, etc) then I stop it immediately. Significantly noticeable, undesirable changes after one use indicate a reaction to something in the product. Make notes about the reaction and the product that caused it, so if you get similar results with something else, you are more likely to be able to figure out why and avoid it in the future. 

If I‚Äôm seeing a more gradual decline from normally good results, then I know the new product is affecting my protein/moisture balance and I need to adjust. Maybe I‚Äôll stop using it altogether. Maybe I‚Äôll use less of it, if it‚Äôs been otherwise beneficial. Maybe I‚Äôll pump up something else to counteract. 

But I‚Äôve been on my curly/wavy journey for a few years now. My hair and I are friends and have a good working relationship. We communicate well. When I began... totally different story. I have a cabinet of products that I thought were awful in the beginning just because I didn‚Äôt know my hair, or how to use them properly. Where I‚Äôm at now, technique makes a bigger difference than the specific products I use, aside from the ones in the ‚Äúreactive‚Äù category. 

In the beginning, you and your hair both have to go through a learning process. In the beginning, product is as important as technique because your hair and scalp aren‚Äôt in balance and probably don‚Äôt remember how to be balanced. Getting from unbalanced to balanced can cause some really ugly hair days in the beginning‚Äîjust like the adage of things get worse before they get better. So, unless you‚Äôre having a reaction to ingredients and *really* bad results, my advice is to give it at least 2 weeks, maybe 3. And during those weeks, change the techniques you‚Äôre using and see if that makes any difference."
alligator124,l46l7i,"Hot take but before I refresh I sort of feel around in my hair and use a wide tooth comb or a wet brush to very, *very* gently redirect knots or wonky clumps."
em1324354657,l46l7i,"The best solution I've found (as annoying as it is) is to get a haircut. I had the same issues and after cutting off the dead ends I can brush with my fingers if I want to.

The other thing that sorta worked was I'd brush before the shower (apparently you're not supposed to but if it works...) And then use a comb or fingers when wet. That gets all the big knots out and won't break up the clumps once it's wet. Braid or pineapple underneath the bonnet also worked better for overnight."
sarai098,l46l7i,"Horrible Tangles Without Brushing?&&&Hi everyone!

As someone who is used to brushing my hair like crazy, I started trying to use a wide-toothed comb instead, only using a wet brush when I have conditioner in my hair when washing.

But it does not work y'all. If I use just a comb over the course of the days after washing I end up with huge, horrible knots that I end up literally ripping out of my hair with a comb. The amount of hair I break and that gets ripped out is significantly more with a comb than a brush. I sleep with a bonnet on and everything, the comb just isn't enough.

Any recommendations on how to help? My hair gets tangled throughout the day and the only solution I've found to not ripping huge knots out id brushing throughout the day.

Cndreader1,l43whj,"I ordered the three-bottle ‚ÄúComplete Curl Care for Soft & Weightless WAVES‚Äù from their website. The order cost nearly $80 CND,with taxes + postage.

MeowMix1998,l43whj,"I just started using LUS.   I am disappointed, to be honest.  That said, I am still working on figuring out application amounts and such.  
I have found the frizz at my scalp is out of control since starting the product.  Like I have a glowing light around my head and should be in a stained glass window... it's bad.  
I emailed LUS asking for guidance and was told to use a wide tooth comb on wet hair to smooth the product (I already do this).  They also encouraged me to be heavier handed at my scalp with step 3.   
So will try that tomorrow morning and see if I get better results. 
I really want this product to work for me.  I miss being wash and go.  COVID has put a dent in any regular trims and/or fresh starts (been in and out of lock down restrictions for months).  Truth be told, since COVID started, I tend to pull my hair back into a clip or pony tail just to keep it from getting stuck in my respirator/mask at work.  
Who knows, maybe I can get in to a salon before they are forced to shut down again (they just reopened 23Jan2021 here).  
To everyone out there - stay safe, check on each other, and be kind (especially to yourself).   Cheers!"
NotSoAdorablyAwkward,l43whj,"I used it for 2 years and really liked it. I especially loved the simple, 3 step routine.

Jaibanii,l424o1,I wouldn‚Äôt use shampoo right after a coloring but just rinse thoroughly with water as cool as you can stand and restyle. Your products should mostly rinse out with water if they‚Äôre CG friendly.  Then put in slightly less product than normal and you should be good to go.
Wavyhaircare,l424o1,"Sure you can rewet your hair. Or even re-wash it. 

When I've cut my hair it took me a while to re-learn how much product to use, too. I can't really tell from your description if you used too much and should cut back, or if you should use the same amount but just distribute it more evenly? 

With too much cream, my hair will look/feel greasy or be weighed down/flat, and with too much foam/mousse my hair would feel producty-, too crunchy even after scrunching, or sticky. Or I think with certain foams it might also be weighed down. So I'd use less if you saw any signs like that."

HydzVance,l41jl9,"HELP! Total newbie here. This is after a night of plopping and my normal routine.&&&&&&I have in the past but not since I‚Äôve had long hair.  I‚Äôll try that though! I try to avoid using any heat since I know my hair is damaged because I dye it.&&&Ah, I hadn‚Äôt even thought of trying that out. Thank you!&&&Okay- so I think I‚Äôm a 2a but I honestly have 0 clue. My current routine/ products: showering at nighttime using Hask Monoi Coconut Oil shampoo and conditioner. Hop out, wrap hair in a microfiber towel for 5-10 minutes. Comb out hair with a wide tooth comb and put in NYM‚Äôs Smooth Moves Frizz Control Cream. Air dry overnight. 

Things I know: my hair is low porosity because it takes all night to dry. If it‚Äôs pulled up/back in any way it won‚Äôt dry fully. I‚Äôm washing my hair every night or every other night (if I braid or put my hair in buns). I know I‚Äôm probably washing too much, but if I don‚Äôt wash at least every other day my hair starts to mat and clump together. Any tips/tricks/product suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Edit because I forgot to mention: I do dye my hair but only using Arctic Fox. I have been trying to only use hair products that are at the very least cruelty free (wholly- no parent company testing either) and at the very most 100% vegan.&&&I‚Äôve only been protecting it on nights when I‚Äôve braided it, I use a bonnet for that.

I cut mine currently because I haven‚Äôt been able to see my regular stylist in months."
Wistfulwanderer13,l41jl9,Comb when conditioner is in your hair only. My feeling is your combing out your waves.
a_diddle,l41jl9,"Maybe you‚Äôre already doing this so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but you can try plopping immediately after getting out of the shower. When you said you wrap your hair up, I‚Äôm assuming you do a regular turban wrap. I find that this pulls my waves out whereas plopping gives them a chance to start drying in their wave pattern."
ants-in-my-plants,l41jl9,"Your hair looks great! Just a note: your hair might not necessarily be low porosity just because it takes a long time to dry overnight. I used to dye my hair and it was VERY high porosity, but it also took forever to dry if I slept on it or pulled it back when wet."
crash_potatoes,l41jl9,"I think you're right about being 2a, and I have similar 2a waves. When my hair gets unbearably matted between washes, I'll sometimes brush it dry with a detangling brush, then wet it down with a mixture of water and leave-in conditioner in a spray bottle. Then I restyle by scrunching in more gel or mousse. This helps me wash less frequently (I typically wash every 4-7 days).

Some people find wet detangling works better for them, so you could also try wetting it down with the water/conditioner mix first. 

With wavy or curly hair, a bit of tangling comes with the territory. I'm wondering if perhaps what looks like horrific matting to you is actually a normal level of wavy-girl day-2 tangly-ness that no one else would even notice :) Wavy hair tends to be drier than straight hair, so you're definitely not doing your hair any favors by washing every day. You could try techniques like praying hands or what I described above to help stretch your wash days a bit further.

Also - you mentioned that you ""wrap"" your hair in a microfiber towel. Are you wrapping it like a turban, or are you plopping?"
goldenmaraduers,l41jl9,Maybe try adding your cream (and try a gel) on **sopping wet hair.** What are you looking to get out of your hair? More definition? Less frizz?
honey_bunchesofoats,l41jl9,"Have you tried diffusing? Whenever I sleep on my wavy hair, nothing I did matters and I need to refresh the next morning (I use either sea salt spray or Ouai‚Äôs Wavy Spray to refresh)."
ohterribleheartt,l41jl9,"Your hair is almost the length of mine. A couple pointers:

1. Only brush your hair when wet, with conditioner in. Don't brush that beautiful gentle curl away. Only use a wet brush or a wide tooth comb, starting at the ends.
2. Try to avoid washing every day. You can get it wet and scrub your fingertips into your scalp to loosen up dirt, but overwashing will dry out your hair.
3. For low porosity and dyed hair (had mine dyed for over 10 years!), try putting a deep leave in condioner on twice a week when it's soaked before you wrap it up. It'll encourage the product to soak in more if you put it in before you even try to dry it.
4. Get a silk bonnet or hankerchief. I always use to rock the braids to bed, but they can still get caught on the pillow and cause friction. A silk pillowcase will be a good start.
5. Try out the 3-4-5 treatment of Olaplex. It's expensive, but worth it. I use all of them together once a week, and 5 twice a week. The Hask product line is awesome, so good call!

You've got beautiful hair, can't wait to see your journey!

You've got gorgeous hair. You've got this!"
pilfernoodles,l41jl9,"Are you protecting your hair while sleeping? If not, you should be, especially with all that length. Not only will that help preserve some waves, it will go a long way to preventing tangles and matting.

The most simple thing would be to braid it, or pineapple it, before bed. A silk or satin pillowcase will also help reduce friction on your hair while you sleep. My preference is a silk pillowcase, because silk also has benefits for your skin too. 

If you‚Äôre already pineappling or braiding, try a buff, bonnet, or silk scarf instead. These reduce the friction on your hair even more than a pineapple or braid, and are especially good if you don‚Äôt tolerate having your hair styled up/drawn back. I like the buff because I can also use it as a sleep mask when my sleeping environment is too bright."
zillarillazilla,l41jl9,"I love your hair! Beautiful, silky waves!! 

Protein - my hair is like yours, low porosity, and using protein will step up the waves. 

Gel/mousse - using something with higher hold will get you more definition. Especially if you diffuse (look up ‚Äúhammock diffusing‚Äù). Try NYM Curl Talk line - has protein and good hold. 

Refresh in the morning - when I shower at night I refresh using handfuls of water and a small amount of product. But brushing it out is working for you! If it‚Äôs not broke, don‚Äôt fix it"
AmazingCheek6468,l3xg4i,"Hello! Im also quite new to wavy hair styling!! Here‚Äôs how i do it:
When i used to style my hair pretty often(not as much now bc of quarantine) i used a lot of styling/leave in cream (olaplex bond smoother leave-in reparative creme) to calm the frizz in my hair, and i use an oil while its dry (aussie total miracle oil) if im not putting it up bc it makes my hair rlly soft, and shiny. 
Rllyyyy depends on the style ur doing, but it still helps to dampen the hair the hair with a spray bottle so its manageable to some degree. After adding in some leave-in creme, it maybe much easier to style it.

Also i wouldn‚Äôt suggest anything that stiffen the hair like hair wax before u are planning to put your hair up!!  Partition the hair first, dampen if necessary and add the cremes, then add the styling gels after once the hair partitioned and in the places u want.

Hope this helps u out!!"
Wavyhaircare,l3xg4i,"Most of us don't try to comb or otherwise work anything through our hair between washes as that will pull apart our curl clumps and/or flatten our waves. So not being able to get your hands through your hair isn't something that I would see as anything being wrong. 

When you are talking about struggling to style your hair, do you mean put it up? I'm not fully understand what you're wanting to do to your hair that you feel you can't do right now other than comb it."
demaniax_99,l3xg4i,"What kind of product should I use to style my wavy, dry and rough hair? Please read description.&&&I've wavy hair and this is my first time growing em out. They are upto chin length.

The problem is that I can't style em. When they are dry I can't even run my hand across them let alone a comb or something like that. The friction is just too much because they are naturally wavy, slightly rough and dry.
The only way I've styled my hair upto now is when they wet or damp because that's when it's possible to manage them.
After styling them (when wet/damp) they tend to lose the style when they start to dry and become tangled somewhat.

I'm really a novice in this. I actually bought a hair wax thinking that it would help me and after a single try I found it's of no use since I can't even run my hand across them. 

What I understand from experience till now is I need to keep the hair moisturized and hence smooth so that they can be styled and manageable.
So my question is what type of product should I aim for ? A hair serum or hair Cream or something like that ? 
Or if my experience is wrong then please suggest me what to do ?
I'm asking this because I don't want to waste money again like I did on hair wax.&&&By styling I mean to get any type of hairstyle by arranging the hair back, sideways or in any other orientation. When dry, I can't even partition them.

Is there any product that would make hair smooth when applied so that it can be arranged easily?"
jenesaisquoi,l3xg4i," I'm super new to this but there's a $20 Walmart starter routine in the wiki ([https://wavyhaircare.com/under-20-simple-wavy-girl-method-starter-routine-from-walmart/](https://wavyhaircare.com/under-20-simple-wavy-girl-method-starter-routine-from-walmart/)) that I'm trying.

It sounds like your hair is dry or something, are you using conditioner? 

Hair wax is for like making mohawks, the site I linked also has hair product exchange sites in there if you want to give it away"
1questions,l3sqf7,"Yes based on this thread some people treat the CGM as a religion, as though none of it can change. Everyone has slightly different hair and lives in places with different weather so there isn‚Äôt an answer that works for everyone all the time."
Glued-Up,l3sqf7,"There's a new wave coming , the #360 Challenge,  its officially called wash your damn hair, its all about ditching your hair products, but I was intrigued. I just stumbled on this sub bc I was looking for help with my waves/curls. I got alot of advice I'm thankful. But I see the best results on ppl when I see, "" I applied nothing put my hair in a 2 strand twist bun and went to bed and woke up like this"", looking like a mermaid. Or I'm in a different country didn't bring product, hair is the best its ever looked. I'm looking for effortless routine, just one product"
Revolutionary-Dance,l3sqf7,"Tip: experiment with the amount of product you use. More product is not necessarily better&&&Sorry if this is obvious to most people, but it was a revelation to me. I‚Äôm new to the curly girl method (have been experimenting since December), and have been generally frustrated with the results. Well, today I was in a rush, so instead of doing the whole styling routine, I just added a nickel-sized amount of curl cream and applied it all over my hair. I LOVE THE RESULTS! My waves actually stuck this time. 

For reference, I had applying a dime size amount of curl cream TO EACH SECTION! I thought I needed to because I have thick, waist-length. Well, turns out more product does not equal more waves. Finally, FINALLY, after almost two months of frustration and trial and error, I think I found something that works for me. 

TLDR: I was too lazy and hurried to do a full styling routine so I added just a tiny bit of product and air dried. Turns out lazy and minimal styling works for me."
modchic,l3sqf7,"Yes! Totally agree! When I first started CGM I was using heaping amounts of product. Didn't help that alot of tutorials I saw had people putting sooo much product in their hair. Once I cut back, I realized I only needed like a dime or nickel sized amount for my entire head! After that, I started focusing on techniques for application. Super important to modify according to what your hair needs!"
