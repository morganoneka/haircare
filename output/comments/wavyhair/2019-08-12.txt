WeAreStarless,cs55mi,"check out the [beginner routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/wiki/beginner-routine) over at r/curlyhair! don't be scared off by the sub name, it's for wavies too but it's just a huge sub with many more resources"

azuu__,cs55mi,"Hair Type Help, any Shampoo/Conditioner recommendations?&&&&&&I've been using OGX Coconut Curls Shampoo & Conditioner, but my hair gets really frizzy and crazy after a day or two after washing. Waves lose their definition, so I'm just looking for something that will better define my waves without weighing them down and hydrate my hair as my it's very thick and pretty dry.&&&Aw thank you so much! I'm going to try to get started on cgm here soon too, but any guidance for my wavy hair would help. I'm a bit scared that the co-wash & conditioning will weigh my hair down."
bookgrrrrrl,cs55mi,"i literally just started cgm with the clarifying wash last night, iâ€™ll let you know if anything is working for me!"
hamsterwaffles,cs55mi,"This may be good advice for some waives, but a lot of waives canâ€™t do full CG so take a lot of the advice with a grain of salt. If your hair is wavy but fine and thin, a lot of the techniques and product recommendations will weigh the hair down, making it dull and greasy."
AwkwrdSparklyPusheen,crwesm,I would guess 2B tbh
bookgrrrrrl,crwesm,Can you confirm hair type?&&&&&&thanks!
katteykatt,crwesm,I would say 2A
randojpg,crwesm,2a barely bordering on 2b
ihearttortillasoup,crrxs4,2A?? I think ðŸ¤”&&&Mine is similar :)
natac33,crrxs4,Help confirming my hair type??&&&
Bubbub1660,crmaxl,"Iâ€™m so confused&&&Hi guys! Iâ€™ve just recently taken interest in caring for my hair. And Iâ€™m really lost.
So my mom has straight hair and my dad has wavy hair and I have. Both? 
I think I have wavy hair because when I get out of the shower my hair is really wavy. But when it dries the wave starts to fall flat and only the ends are curled. 
My hair is down to my butt and Iâ€™ve never put any effort into caring for it so I was thinking maybe thatâ€™s it?
Has anyone with wavy hair not known how wavy their hair was until getting it cut/caring for it. 
Or am I in the wrong subreddit"
gemushka,crmaxl,"The length is probably pulling down the waves/curls. If you want it wavier then try following curly girl method but you may not get the maximum possible out of it without a hair cut (not suggesting you have to, just that you have to decide which you would rather have - long long hair or more waves)."
menchekia,crmaxl,"Nope, you are in the right sub.  I didn't know exactly how wavy/curly my hair was until about this time last year.  And I am in my 30s.

There is a lot of info out there & I think it particularly hard for wavy haired people because a lot of the products are designed for people with much curlier hair.

Look for lightweight products, like foams or mousses, or ones that say lightweight or Featherlight.  And I recommend a lot of youtube to see what other ladies with your curl type do & go from there."
randojpg,crmaxl,"Youâ€™re in the right place! Iâ€™d try getting a couple layers so that the weight of the hair doesnâ€™t stretch the waves. 2 or 3 inches off would also be a good idea if the ends are dry or damaged. Try a modified curly girl method for you! A lot of cgâ€™s put endless products in their hair, but thereâ€™s no need to fill your routine with that many products. Just start off with a sulfate/silicone free shampoo, conditioner, and a leave in. Be sure to read the ingredients on the back to check if itâ€™s truly silicone free. After that you can tweak your routine and add a gel or a curling cream."
OliviaLivLivvie,cpmuku,Mind writing out all the products you use in the video? Great results!!
aheady854,cpmuku,How often do you wash your hair? Sorry for the weird question i was just wondering how long your hair holds this amazing definition!
catnipandcatnaps,cpmuku,Do you find with thin hair that just co-washing makes it greasy? I'm struggling with that now.
edgeofchaos183,cpmuku,Solid! Thanks for posting this. Iâ€™m struggling with getting my mostly wavy - with a couple straight funky chunks - to do anything nice. Going to try the Aussie if I can find it.
graceabigail04,cpmuku,"my wavy hair routine (curly girl method approved)&&&&&&Thank you! In the description I wrote out what I was doing in every step if youâ€™d like to read that. I used aussieâ€™s miracle curls co-wash as a shampoo and conditioner. Out of the shower I used itâ€™s a ten leave in conditioner. I put curly sexy hair mousse in my roots for volume. In the video I use 2 curl creams but normally use one. I just showed both because I use them both a lot. The first one is Shea Moistures Coconut mas Hibiscus Curl Smoothie, I have thin hair so I only use a tiny amount of this product. The second one is Not You Mothers Curl Talk Curl cream. This one is probably my favorite. Finally I use Aussies Gel to set it in. I let my hair dry and then scrunched out the gel and shook my roots.&&&I was very skeptical of co-washing because I have thin hair. I had seen that you could make your own co-wash by mixing shampoo and conditioner, but that did not work for me. However I gave Aussieâ€™s Miracle Curls co-wash a try and Iâ€™m so glad I did. When you first use it, it messes with your head because it is zero lather. I remember thinking how could this possibly clean my hair. The key is to really massage it into your scalp. I donâ€™t exactly remember if my hair needed time to adjust, but if it did it definitely wasnâ€™t long at all.&&&Three days"
smell_ya_latah,cpmuku,"Gorgeous results!  I am new to GC method, and trying to figure out my waves. Do you clarify with any type of lathering shampoo periodically?  If so, how often?  Thanks for posting this video."
