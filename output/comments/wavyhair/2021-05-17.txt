CallMeKatt78,njjkl2,"Flat/straight roots: Years of high-tight ponytails. 2a/2b&&&Most days my waves don't really start until about the top to mid portion of my ear. However, there are days I get wave almost to the root with most of my hair so I know the roots and high-mids can achieve waves.

I totally get it, I also just got into the whole wavy thing and I have the same situation with my hair (read: bleach!)

trappercomplex,njfgk0,"Leave-ins and styling products for fine, thin, high-porosity hair? (explanation in comments)&&&&&&Since realizing my hair is wavy a few weeks ago, I've decided to rebuild my hair care routine from the ground up. The products I used before all contained protein, causing brittle, strawlike ends and lots of breakage (my city has hard water, which def makes this worse). My hair is very high porosity, and a lot of it has been chemically damaged (bleach and semi-permanent dye). Also - I gave myself a mullet/shag cut a year ago, and just recently decided to grow out the front. My hair in the back is the longest it's ever been, but in the front it's still chin-length and the waves around my face are much looser than in the back.   
So far I've used NYM Matcha Apple Blossom shampoo and conditioner for a few washes, and my hair is reacting well to a drying in a t-shirt and a no-brush policy. However, all of my old leave-ins are oil-heavy and weigh down my hair. I'm looking for protein-free leave-in conditioners and mousses/gels for fine, high-porosity hair. Any suggestions are welcome! Thanks!"

jo_bani,njfa2q,"I don't have this issue exactly so I'll keep my input limited, but if zinc pyrithione helps you then you might take a look at the As I Am Dry and Itchy scalp care line. I use the cowash, and while I had only very minor flake issues it seems to have helped a ton. It might work to use it in rotation with whatever shampoo currently works for your scalp issues so that you're overall drying your hair out less. 

Also. I tried using the NYM matcha and apple blossom shampoo and for whatever reason it made my scalp super itchy. I don't know if that could be it at all, 1) because you're using the mask, not the shampoo and 2) I don't even know what I was reacting to, but I thought I'd throw it out there."
justukyte,njfa2q,"I also have recurring seborrheic dermatitis. I mostly had flare ups if I washed my hair in the evening and went to sleep with damp hair. Getting up early and wash it in the morning helped to tone it down. My scalp used to be prone to greasiness and itchiness up to a point where I used clarifying or aggressive shampoos nearly every wash, such as Ducray Kelual DS. Switching shampoos to more gentler ones helped over time. Since my scalp is prone to build up, I still use sulphate shampoos every now and then, mixing in CGM shampoos and other products as well. But I'd say it's less about the products and more about your hair washing routine.

Properly massaging all your scalp with your fingers while shampooing is very important. Do this for at least 2 minutes and you'll see the results immediately, shampooing becomes less frequent and you will need less product.

I'd say you should use dandruff shampoos at least until the flare ups are gone, but try to do it less and less frequently in order to avoid scalp dryness which in turn provokes your scalp to produce more oil and therefore greasiness. Use it up to 2 times a week, then once every 1-2 weeks and afterwards once a month once it goes down. Use gentler products inbetween. 

Also, from personal experience, cutting down and eliminating ***sugar*** from food helped reduce scalp greasiness and itchiness the most."
v0dkamom,njfa2q,"Scalp Issues & WGM&&&Hey everyone, I'm pretty new to WGM and have begun experimenting. Going sulfate-free and focusing on adding a lot of moisture to my hair has helped a ton already, my hair feels a lot softer and healthier (although I still have to cut off some damage.) However, I've always struggled with scalp issues. I've been searching and haven't found what I'm looking for on natural beauty subs, so let me know if this is not the right place for this question.

I've always had dandruff and an itchy scalp. Dandruff shampoos can help calm it down, but my scalp usually gets used to it and gets crazy again. And many of those shampoos can be very stripping for my (wavy 2A-2B) hair. 

I'm really confused... not sure the root cause (overproduction of sebum? pH imbalance? yeast/bacteria? just bad sensitive problematic skin genes?) or how to go about fixing it, especially in conjunction with my attempts at WGM. I had seborrheic dermatitis on my face and fixed it with a zinc pyrithione cleanser. 

Any help or advice would be greatly greatly appreciated. 

More info on my (new) routine: I've switched to sulfate-free shampoo (Hask Coconut Oil Shampoo) and use that almost exclusively, as well as sulfate and paraben-free conditioner (Hask Protein Conditioner) and occasional deep conditioning (NYM Naturals Green Tea/Apple Blossom Deep Conditioner). I've been experimenting with drying/styling techniques and a few products. I'm occasionally using my old Dove dandruff shampoo as a clarifying wash, but that's not cutting it for the scalp issues.&&&Thank you! Ugh, it's such a tough problem to balance with my attempts to improve my hair health. I'm sure the scalp/skin issues and overall hair health are related, I just don't know how exactly. I agree, I probably need to address the inflammation first."
TastyAlpacasRUs,njem4q,"Is Cream and Gel Too Much For Me?&&&So this is a simple troubleshooting post. 

I'm pretty sure cream and gel are too much for my hair, but I wanted to ask you all. 

I have hair on the finer side with some coarse strands. I have a lot of hair (as I've been told). 

I wash my hair every other day or else my hair gets extremely greasy, and I cleaned my hair once a week. 

I do not use curly girl approved products necessarily, but I am happy with what I use. I just am needing to find the perfect combo with my products, and how to style best for my hair. 

As you can see I'm type 2 (not necessarily sure the specifics if I'm A, B, or C or a mix). 

I wash my hair with BB curl moisture shampoo, condition with BB curl conditioner, and I usually massage my scalp with a scalp massager for the shampoo and use a denman brush to distribute the conditioner. In this picture specifically, after the shower I put in BB curl cream with a denman brush then layered it with Ouidad Humidity gel. 

It definitely did not give me as much volume as just using my conditioner as a leave-in with mousse or gel. I feel mousse dries my hair too much or moreover it does NOT have enough hold. So I'm trying to find out how to work this. Also, I typically plop upside down but I feel that microplopping would be more beneficial since I have a specific way I like to split my hair (and because I have front straight bangs). 

I currently have shea moisture manuka honey and yogurt protein treatment, and I also have Briogeo Don't Despair Repair Hair mask. Not sure if I need to use both of those or either or, and how many times I should use them. I also got a haircut recently (2 inches cut off), and my hair is MUCH better than what it was.

Any tips or tricks would be helpful such as if I should use a leave-in, mousse, gel, cream, a mix, etc....

Hapito_,njd3wm,I use the curl talk mousse and i definitely understand that gross feeling you are talking about.
em7070,njd3wm,"New to CGM, Hair feels gross after a few hours after SOTC&&&&&&Thank you for the suggestions! Any recommendation for a low porosity curl cream that you‚Äôve found useful?&&&Routine: Shampoo with NYM Blue Sea Kelp, condition with Kinky Curly Knot Today and rinse it out. Wet brush in shower, get get out excess with microfiber towel. Prayer hands and scrunch Aussie Instant Freeze (also tried NYM Curl Talk Mousse but it felt even worse). Plop for like 30 minutes and air dry. Airy takes 5+ hours to air dry, and I commonly sleep with it wet and wake up still slightly wet (so hasn‚Äôt worked well with a pineapple). Once it‚Äôs finally dry I SOTC and it looks nice but after a few hours it‚Äôs frizzy and feels coated in product. 

Overall having a hard time with the hair feeling bad when it‚Äôs normally very soft product free, and trying to figure out best method for drying. Tried diffusing but after 20 minutes on medium heat barely any water was out and I quit. Very open to any tips, I read so many of the intro articles and product suggestions and just started with these."
hollykins,njd3wm,"That sounds really similar to what I experience! My 2A hair takes FOREVER to dry and I figure that's one of the big reasons the waves fall out after a few hours once the cast is scrunched - all that extra water weight, maybe?

I haven't figured the perfect routine yet, but here is the routine that has helped most so far:

* Apply product (curl cream) soaking wet and only plop for a few minutes while I'm right out of the shower and applying skincare etc.
* Take hair out of plop and apply gel
* Microplop with microfiber towel and then apply more gel
* Immediately diffuse \~20 min until it's about \~50% dry and then air dry the rest of the way - and the method of diffusing matters for me. I need to hover diffuse to get my roots/middle lengths less wet before going into the usual pixie diffusing (I usually do hover diffuse \~10-15 min, then do 2-3 rounds of pixie diffusing depending on how much time I have and how sick I am of holding the blow-dryer at that point)
* I've also been experimenting with hairspray and, honestly, it helps - I tend to hairspray it after I'm done diffusing, before air-drying the rest of the way.

I also will sleep in the cast - works just fine as long as I do a bit of a refresh when I'm up in the morning with some extra curl cream and hairspray!"

CedarMountainTop,nj8emu,"First off, I think that in general your hair looks good. You have done an excellent job of making sure that you don't have a lot of frizz, which is a great achievement. Next, you posted 9 pictures and your hair looks very different. I think that picture 3 in the green t-shirt looks idea. Picture 1 is the least idea, b/c I don't see a lot of curls or waves. You need more clumping. Instead of doing the denman: Try squish to condish to get the curls to lump and then bowl method to rinse (end up with like 6-8 curl clumps for whole head) then use praying hands to distribute the product and clump again. You should feel some slip on. Then plop or air dry/diffuse. If you aren't getting a cast, it's probably b/c the products you use don't make a cast. I agree with others that many of your pictures look like your hair is more weighed down than I like it. I personally have fine, low porosity hair and can't use any shea or cantu products. They never casted and they weighed down my hair. Google around (youtube?) for someone with your hair type (fine, medium, thick) and porosity, preferably with the same hardness of water in your area whose hair you like and see what products they are using. Good luck!"

For myself, whenever I use a cream my hair gets weighed down and looks like what is in the pictures.

TheMadeline,nj7tg7,"Good wave day!&&&&&&Im not sure how old she is and I don‚Äôt know a lot about kid hair care, but what worked for me was:

- stop brushing it except while it‚Äôs wet in the shower. Brushing dry will just make it fluffy. 

- while it‚Äôs wet, flip head upside down and scrunch it up towards my scalp to help the curl/wave clumps form. (I usually add gel at this point but for a kid maybe mousse would be better so she doesn‚Äôt have to deal with crunchy hair)

- instead of towelling my hair dry, I gently squeeze the water out with an old cotton t-shirt (this is a lot gentler and won‚Äôt disrupt the curl clumps). I also do this with my head upside down using a scrunching motion. 

I also usually plop my hair (dump it upside down onto a t-shirt and tie it to my head while it partially dries) but for a kid you could maybe try a silk bonnet or just blow dry with a diffuser if she‚Äôll sit still for that. 

Hope this helps!&&&Routine:

Ladonnacinica,nj0aa2,"Yeah, I had that happen to me when it gets really humid and hot. And nothing is changed in my routine. My hair turns much wavier. 

On the other hand, during winter it can get damaged because of the bitter cold and get flat. 

Our hair type is a very fragile and volatile type."
Pey777,nj0aa2,"Does anyone‚Äôs hair get really curly in the summer even if you use exactly the same routine? Why?&&&Title is pretty self explanatory. I started modified CG almost exactly a year ago (woo!). I went from being maybe 2a, with super frizzy and uncooperative hair (the first few months of doing CG I wasn‚Äôt even sure if it was worth it) to a pretty consistent 2b/c (hard to say exactly what type, typing is a bit arbitrary imo). Summer humidity used to be my mortal enemy, but now that it is summer/spring again, my hair has been thriving! My hair has gradually gotten curlier over the past year, but with the warmer weather It made almost an overnight jump to like 3a/b (once again, arbitrary). Same thing when I went to the beach a little bit ago‚Äî I could have styled my hair with Elmers glue and it would have been a great hair day!

The question is, why? I have heard it is the humidity. I guess that sort of makes sense because water makes your hair go back to its natural curl pattern.

Bye luscious curls üò≠üëã"
Wavyhaircare,nj0aa2,"My understanding is that our hair always balancse out its moisture level with the air moisture level. So regardless of what we try to do with products, our hair is going to be dryer in dry climates than it is in humid climates. 

So in the winter, you wet your hair, but as it dries it will get more dried out due to balancing out with the dry winter air. Where in the summer it will work to match the humidity level in the air and stay better hydrated."
sabros_we,nj0aa2,I noticed the same thing but I'm thinking it might have something to do with my hair drying way faster in spring/summer and not being weighed down by the water for as long.

They were already trimmed, but they are basically burnt with bleach and no amount of treatments helps. I used to have short hair, so I‚Äôm thinking maybe it would be better to start from short and let them grow healthy"
softblackstar,nilrhb,"It's up to you, I think another option is getting a trim to get rid of the most damaged parts (although it doesn't look bad at all in your photo), and perhaps getting some semi-permanent dye to match your natural color, so the transition wouldn't be so stark. It probably depends on how short you're willing to cut your hair, blending in the ends will allow you to grow it out and gradually get rid of the bleached lengths."
