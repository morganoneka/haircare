Notalwaysalonehere,adgrke,"Routine help&&&I just realized I have 2a hair, which is fairly straight when I brush it and I want to get it healthy and curling properly. I like mane and tail shampoo and conditioner (I water the shampoo down a lot in a bottle to use so it's not as sudsy). I have fine hair so products are weird for me to try to find. It's currently a short pixie cut but I want to get the curl going as it grows&&&I figured that out! I now use tresseme touchable soft and that is working really nicely "
midtwentiesangst,adgrke,Over use of mane n tail will cause a build up of excess protein to coat your hair and cause it to become hard and brittle and extremely hard to do anything to.&&&I’m glad you found a solution! I’m still struggling with too heavy of a finished result after using the CGM so I’m trying to find what’s right for me. I feel like the gel is a little too heavy for me so I’m on the hunt for a nice CG approved mousse 
tiddle49,adgrke,"I’m in a rut with ya! Everything weighs my over-processed hair down. I was a 3b now a 2b barely. So very unsure of product usage, amounts, etc. tried to follow CG method and it doesn’t work well for me. I just purchased a smattering of more products in what’s becoming a desperate attempt not to have wet dog hair look lol. I’ll let you know somewhere how they all work out. One place to reference products per hair type is naturallycurly.com"
