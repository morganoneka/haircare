our-lady-calypso,r9wfc8,"My hair doesn't know if it's wavy or curly? (More below)&&&&&&When my hair was longer, it was moderately wavy. And sometimes it curls in the front. Unsure how to bring these out. My hair can get oily easily with too many products.

I use Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner. And OGX coconut serum. If I don't use the serum my hair gets very frizzy and dry. I wash about every two days&&&I do not! I'm going to have to try that."

Wash with Biolage Hydrasource shampoo. Squish in Biolage Hydrasource conditioning balm; leave in while I finish the rest of my shower then rinse while squishing out water. Wrap in a microfiber hair towel for 5-10 minutes. Rake through a small bit of Garnier Fructis Hydrating Treat with aloe to detangle and comb through with a wide tooth comb. Apply OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream with praying hands and scrunch. Let dry. 

I love the air dry cream because it doesn‚Äôt make a cast or weigh down my hair. All I have to do is fluff it a bit once it‚Äôs dry. And it smells nice!"
SacrilegiousCat,r9u8up,"Help - dry frizzy hair and waves are gone by the second day.&&&&&&My hair routine:

Wash hair once or twice a week with SheaMoisture honey and yogurt shampoo and conditioner ( switching to Redken bond building shampoo and conditions)

Use a bit of shea moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque from root to tip.

Scrunch in Marc Anthony strictly curls cream and foam

Usually I will defuse it or I will leave it to air dry. 
I don't use heat on my hair unless I'm blow drying it on low heat. My hair usually is pretty flat by the second or third day barely any waves. It gets tangled really fast and kinda dry. I've been having an itchy scalp I don't have dandruff but I think that it might be due to weather changes.

kiskranky,r9u8up,I think your hair looks great. I have this issue sometimes too though. You could always add water to it or some cgm approved oil for the ends on the second day. I know shea moisture has a coconut oil serum that I‚Äôve heard good things about.

Baleigh25,r9lx3a,"Is my hair even wavy or am I just delusional?? (more in comments)&&&&&&Thank you for the clarification! ü•∞&&&I‚Äôm mostly just asking for clarification since on my last post someone said it was 1b-1c. I grew up with ‚Äústraight‚Äù hair and thought it was just my life to have ‚Äústaticky‚Äù hair. I‚Äôm now realizing the static was probably just frizz and the straight hair was because I was brushing/combing it out wet and wasn‚Äôt doing any sort of curly/wavy hair care with it. I just don‚Äôt want to do the wrong things and while I‚Äôve done a bit of research in the forms of reading on here and watching videos I‚Äôm still very new to doing this to my own hair.&&&Thank you!!!&&&Alright so I posted on here the other day because I‚Äôve been having issues with hair looking weird/not waving as much on one side and one person suggested that I might have 1b/1c hair instead. 

This is going to be long. 

The other day I used a curl cream and a gel. I think the curl cream was definitely too heavy for my fine hair so today I used a clarifying shampoo to get rid of product buildup, used a protein deep conditioning mask, squished to condish, used cold water added in mousse and gel‚Ä¶.And then basically rinsed most of it out because I was getting wet frizz again‚Ä¶

Flash forward to out of the shower I brushed my hair out using a detangler brush and then scrunched in some more mousse and gel and then I hovered my diffuser over my hair on cold for a bit before eventually going to using it to diffuse/plop/whatever it‚Äôs called when you hold it up to your head. I tried to do both right side up and upside down for this and tried to make sure I was getting my roots as much as possible. When it was mostly dry I flipped my hair over and used some hair oil to sotc as well as a satin pillow case to help prevent extra frizz. 

2 main things I‚Äôm noticing today:
1. My hair is a lot more voluminous
2. the waves look softer but they seem to look more even on each side. The other day‚Äôs experience was basically one side looking like loose 2a and the other side looking like a tight 1b-c. Today it looks a lot more uniform even if the ‚Äúwaves‚Äù aren‚Äôt really as defined. 

I guess my question is am I fooling myself into thinking I have some wave to my hair. I know it‚Äôs probably only a 2a at the most, but any help would be appreciated.

Edited to Add: 

My night shift working brain doesn‚Äôt know what days I‚Äôm talking about. The photo that I said was the other day was yesterday and if I remember right I added in a curl cream that you can use when your hair is dry that I think just made my hair look awful by the end of the night since my hair eventually made its way into a braid at work.&&&I‚Äôm thinking I have low porosity&&&Aww thank you so much!

earlyatnight,r9lx3a,I wish mine looked like yours! Also your eyeshape is really beautiful!
halfginger16,r9lx3a,Do you have any recommendations on curl definers? My hair gets weighed down if you look at it funny.
minecraftgirlie666,r9lx3a,"Your hair is most definitely wavy. The truth is, majority of the population does not have straight hair. If your hair were straight, scrunching and products would do nothing. Your hair would fall back into being straight after styling. So yes, definitely wavy."
mochipoki,r9lx3a,Your hair looks just like mine!
oatbevbran,r9lx3a,You‚Äôre wavy for sure! You‚Äôve done some great experimenting so far and sounds like you‚Äôve found a routine that kinda works‚ÄîYAY! Curl type numbers/letters  are a super loose guide. The only thing that really counts is your personal experiences and what works for you and your lifestyle. Sounds like you‚Äôre making terrific progress and your waves are gorgeous!
whit_flinn,r9lx3a,"Your hair looks 2a to me, like mine when it‚Äôs a bit shorter. Just try not to get too caught up in always having uniform waves, 2a and looser curl patterns have trouble holding and that‚Äôs just that usually. Gel helps me the most if I‚Äôm looking for staying power but tbh most of the time I just use a lightweight curl definer and scrunch and that‚Äôs it, because the whole gel, mouse, diffuser thing gets old after awhile."
CaliforniaMemer,r9kf39,"I'm not well versed in CGM yet but wanted to let you know that J&J is currently undergoing a class action lawsuit claiming that OGX shampoos and conditioners lead to hair loss. So that may explain the hair loss!

https://www.prevention.com/beauty/hair/a37102895/ogx-hair-loss-lawsuit-johnson-and-johnson/"
IndecisiveFireball,r9kf39,"I lose a lot of hair when I wash my hair too. It's normal to be losing hair regularly, but most people don't realize how much they lose because it comes out when they brush and wash their hair, or just throughout the day. When people do those things daily it's not a lot of hair. BUT, if you don't do those things daily, when you *do* it can feel like you're losing way more hair than normal! I don't brush my hair daily (or ever) and I only wash twice a week so I shed quite a bit when I do wash it. That may or may not be the reason for your hair loss, but I thought I'd throw it out there just in case!

In terms of shampoo suggestions, Shea moisture and the argan oil may be too heavy for your hair. Try something lighter and less moisturizing and see how that goes! I personally like Not Your Mother's a lot. Hairitage by Mindy also has some good lightweight options but I'm not sure if they are CGM approved or not."
SplitfacedSkincare,r9kf39,"Any product could cause an issue if you‚Äôre allergic to something in it, but if you‚Äôre not allergic there‚Äôs no evidence that DMDM hydantoin causes hair loss at the minuscule quantities that are approved to be used in cosmetics

blckrainbow,r9kf39,"As someone else said, losing 'a lot' of hair is normal especially if you only wash once or twice a week, don't brush at all and your hair is long, so I wouldn't worry about it unless you see thinning and bald spots. 

I'd recommend using a sulfate shampoo more regularly, both SM and OGX are sulfate free shampoos and not clarifying often enough definitely can lead to hair loss and damage as you are not cleansing the scalp properly. 

Also is the OGX argan oil that you use as one of your last products the ARGAN OIL OF MOROCCO (PENETRATING) OIL? If so, you might want to toss it or step up your clarifying game because literally the first three ingredients are silicones: 

Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Fragrance (Parfum), Red 17 (CI 26100), Yellow 11 (CI 47000)."

Adabellaaberline,r9jegn,"Starting to get fairly consistent results that I'm happy with!&&&&&&Washed my hair last night and put my hair in a pineapple when it was dry without scrunching out the crunch first. This picture is immediately after I released my hair from its pineapple. My day 2 hair is very similar, usually just a bit less definition.

For my routine right now I am using the NYM scalp refresh shampoo and conditioner as I've been having some flaky scalp issues. This was my ~3rd wash using it. I shampoo just the scalp and use a silicone scrub brush to clean my scalp and then rinse and repeat. I had been conditioning just the end and brushing it through but for the past few washes it have also been conditioning my scalp to see if the extra moisture helps at all. My hair doesn't get weighed down or greasy very fast. I rinse the conditioner from my scalp after 5-10 minutes and STC the remainder out of the ends.

For stylers I am using the Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie and the Ouidad climate control gel immediately after rinsing on my soaking wet hair. I rake a small amount in to each side and then plop in a microfiber towel for 10-15 minutes. When I release my hair from the plop I apply a good amount of Ecoslay Orange Marmalade using praying hands and scrunching and the let it dry. Depending on how late it is I might diffuse for 10-20 minutes with the big black orchid diffuser or I may let it air dry (this picture is air dried). When scrunching out the remaining crunch in the morning I use  few drops of the Briogeo don't despair repair oil on my hands."
Katlynashe,r9jegn,I love the texture and twists you have.  Your hair looks really great!

ndcdshed,r9akig,"Looks wavy and in nice condition! 

I think you‚Äôre mistaking fluffy waves with damage. Most waves are like that with no product. A product with hold like a mousse or gel will help clump your curls and give definition."
taradactyle_,r9akig,"Definitely have waves/curls, and I think you could also benefit from a curly cut to add some layers and bring your curls back to life!"
Emarieexd,r96sna,Hmmm you might just benefit from scrunching in mousse for more volume or gel for more definition and diffuse or let air dry but don‚Äôt plop. And I would go right to scrunching product in instead of raking or brushing just to see what it does for you and if it doesn‚Äôt give you great results then try a denman brush. Once dry maybe try using a sea salt spray and scrunching again to give it more body. It‚Äôs hard to get volume on top of definition for us loose wavy girls. A lot of wavies have been doing The Bowl Method too and getting great results! I‚Äôd suggest trying that out too if you haven‚Äôt!

LesterMcGillicuddy,r96sna,"Similar hair here...

I have little to no volume and definition, and that's mostly because it's so. damn. soft. even if I use heavy hold products, it still loses shape after a few hours. and if the waves somehow look decent, it feels greasy and heavy from all the products.

WeAreStarless,r9199c,the first rule of wavy / curly hair is you do not brush wavy / curly hair!
awful_falafels,r9199c,"I never dry brush for this reason. My hair doesn't sound as thick and it is fine, not coarse, but I still get crazy poof if I dry brush. I will occasionally finger detangle VERY gently of I feel a bigger knot/tangle on the underside of my hair. This is usually in the evening while I watch TV. That way I can refresh in the morning, because any kind of dry brushing kills my waves/curls instantly"
headoverheels14,r9199c,"You can brush your hair! Wavy girls in particular often need to because our hair gets more tangly than curly hair.  Use a wet brush in the shower with conditioner--you'll be amazed how easily the tangles come out! I only dry brush my hair occasionally. If my hair is super super tangly I will dry brush it before I take a shower. Or I will dry brush it and then pull it back into a bun or ponytail--I find that brushing it allows for a smoother looking style. But if I am styling my hair wavy and air drying I do this: 

1. Use a wet brush in the shower with my conditioner 
2.  Put in leave in after my shower again brushing my hair to enemy distribute it 
DO NOT BRUSH AFTER THIS STEP
3.  Add mousse and scrunch it into my hair

w11f1ow3r,r9199c,We have similar hair I think. The issue is that you‚Äôre separating the defined waves after they‚Äôre dry. I detangle my hair before I take a shower. After I get out of the shower I put a leave in product in my hair - Cantu Wave Whip Mousse. I scrunch the product up to my head and do not detangle or separate the curls at all. I have to use a more gel- like product on top of that because I‚Äôm in a high humidity environment but depending on where you‚Äôre located you will probably see a lot of improvement with not detangling your hair after it‚Äôs dry and/or using just a light leave-in.

Wash once a week with Nizoral ( scalp problems so  can't  change that);

I'd say more like 2b. And I think your hair looks good especially if you're just starting out. It can take awhile for your hair to adjust to the products.

What is the bowl method?"
saquit,r8rzaf,"Starting my journey: bowl method results&&&&&&Wash day routine:

Pre-shampoo: curlsmith rehab salve (tried for the first time this week, planning on using it every 1.5 months)

Shampoo/conditioner: Ouidad vitacurl 

Clarify 1x a month with Ouai Detox shampoo

Curl cream: Ouidad curl milk 

Mousse: Ouidad vitacurl 

Oil: I don‚Äôt like using oil because I feel like it weighs down my hair, so I just use a few spritzes of Ouidad revive and shine spray to scrunch the crunch


My hair is thin, fine, still trying to figure out porosity but I think it‚Äôs high porosity. 

I need help figuring out how to make my hair feel less‚Ä¶ crazy. I‚Äôve been wearing my hair wavy for about a month now.  I like how it looks from the back currently (pics are Day 3 hair after refreshing). I think my hair is around Type 2A but I‚Äôm not sure."
